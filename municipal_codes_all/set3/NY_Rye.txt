authorizes political subdivisions of the state to provide for the continuity
of their governments in the event of an actual or imminent attack upon
the United States by an enemy or foreign nation. The General Municipal
Law, in Section 60 thereof, authorizes political subdivisions to provide for
the continuity of their governments in the event of other public disasters,
catastrophes or emergencies. Based on the authority contained in such

this chapter for possible temporary succession to the powers and duties, but

powers in meeting emergency conditions. Such disasters, catastrophes and

three duly authorized deputies or emergency interim successors, or

only until such time as the lawful incumbent officer or his duly authorized
deputy, if any, or an emergency interim successor higher in rank in order
of succession, resumes the office or undertakes the performance of the
powers and duties of the office, as the case may be, or until, where an actual
vacancy exists, a successor is duly elected or appointed to fill such vacancy
and qualifies as provided by law.

ARTICLE I
Award of Contracts on Basis of Best Value
[Adopted 11-7-2018 by L.L. No. 8-2018]
§ 32-1. Title.
This article shall be known as the "City of Rye Local Law Authorizing Best
Value Competitive Bidding and Procurement."
§ 32-2. Legislative intent; purpose.
The intent of this article is to allow the City of Rye the option to award
certain purchase contracts (including contracts for services) subject to
competitive bidding under § 103 of the General Municipal Law on the basis
of low bid or "best value" as defined in § 163 of the New York State Finance
Law.
§ 32-3. Legislative authority.
This article is enacted pursuant to New York State General Municipal Law
§ 103.
§ 32-4. Best value competitive bidding.
A. Authority and purpose. Section 103 of the New York General Municipal
Law allows the City to authorize, by local law, the award of certain
purchase contracts (including contracts for services) subject to
competitive bidding under General Municipal Law § 103 on the basis of
"best value" as defined in § 163 of the New York State Finance Law. The
best value option may be used, for example, if it is more cost-efficient
over time to award the goods or service to other than the lowest
responsible bidder or offerer if factors such as lower cost of
maintenance, durability, high quality and longer product life can be
documented.
B. Award based on best value. The City Council may award purchase
contracts, including contracts for services, on the basis of "best value"
as the term is defined in New York State Finance Law § 163. All
contracts or purchase orders awarded based on value shall require City
Council approval.
C. Applicability. The provisions of this article apply to City purchase
contracts, including contracts for services, involving an expenditure of
more than $20,000, but excluding purchase contracts necessary for the
completion of a public works contract pursuant to Article 8 of the New
York Labor Law and any other contract that may in the future be
excluded under state law from the best value option. If the dollar
thresholds of the New York General Municipal Law § 103 are increased
or decreased in the future by the State Legislature, the dollar
thresholds set forth herein shall be deemed simultaneously amended to
match the new General Municipal Law thresholds.
§ 32-1 HUMAN RIGHTS, COMMISSION OF § 32-4
22:141
D. Standards for best value.
(1) Goods and services procured and awarded based on the basis of
best value are those that the City Council determines optimize
quality, cost and efficiency, among responsive and responsible
bidder or offerers.
(2) Where possible, the determination shall be based on an objective
and quantifiable analysis of clearly described and documented
criteria as they apply to the rating of bids or offers. The criteria
may include, but shall not be limited to, any or all of the following:
(a) Cost of maintenance;
(b) Proximity to the contractors;
(c) Longer product life;
(d) Product performance criteria; and
(e) Quality of craftsmanship.
E. Documentation. Whenever any contract is awarded on the basis of best
value instead of lowest responsible bidder, the basis for determining
best value shall be thoroughly and accurately documented.
F. Piggybacking of purchases. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
article, the City of Rye may, for purposes of public purchases, utilize the
provisions of General Municipal Law § 103, the City of Rye may
purchase through the bids solicited by the United States government,
New York State, other U.S. states and/or any other political subdivision,
provided that those contracts clearly state that they are available for
use by other governmental entities within the requirements of General
Municipal Law § 103, Subdivision 16. Prior to such purchase, the City of
Rye will ensure that a piggyback purchase qualifies as follows:
(1) The contract involved must have been available for use by other
governmental entities through the bid solicitation process. In such
case, the City of Rye should determine that there is contained
within the bidding municipality's bid package a provision that the
bid is open to and can be used by either the City of Rye or other
municipalities. This determination should be made on a case-bycase
basis.
(2) The specific contract must have been issued in accordance with the
provisions of General Municipal Law § 103.
G. Procurement policy superseded where inconsistent. Any inconsistent
provision of the City's procurement policy, as adopted prior to the
effective date of this article by resolution of the City Council, or as
amended thereafter, shall be deemed superseded by the provisions of
this article.

§ 47-1. Intent.
It is the intent of the City of Rye, as an exercise of its police power,
to promote the general health, safety and welfare of the residents and
inhabitants of the city by enacting this chapter, since it is the finding
of the City Council of the City of Rye that the consumption of alcoholic
beverages and the possession of open containers of alcoholic beverages
by persons on certain public lands, except under controlled conditions, is
detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city
in that such consumption and possession contributes to the development
of unsanitary conditions and the creation of nuisances, including but not
limited to littering and raucous or other disorderly behavior. This chapter
shall not be considered as a traffic regulation insofar as it relates to motor
vehicles or the operation thereof.

of and shall automatically terminate its operation within 10 minutes of
its being activated.
E. Exceptions. None of the provisions of this chapter shall apply to a fire or
police alarm device or devices installed in a motor vehicle or trailer, nor
to employees of a public utility company engaged in the business of
providing communication, services or facilities.

automatically selects a telephone trunk line of the Police or Fire
Department of the City of Rye and then reproduces any prerecorded
voice messages to report any robbery, burglary or fire. The use of any
dial alarm device which relays a digital coded signal to the central
alarm monitoring facility is permitted under this chapter. [Added

A. The Council hereby finds that excessive uniformity, dissimilarity,
inappropriateness or poor quality of design in the exterior appearance
of structures erected, reconstructed or altered in any residential,
business and other areas in the City of Rye adversely affects the
desirability of the immediate area and neighboring areas within the
community and by so doing impairs the benefits of occupancy or use of
real property in such areas, impairs the stability and value of both
improved and unimproved real property in such areas, prevents the
most appropriate development of such areas, produces degeneration of
the property in such areas, with attendant deterioration of conditions
affecting the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the
inhabitants of the community, and destroys a proper relationship
between the taxable value of real property in the community and the
cost of municipal services provided therefor. It is the purpose of this
chapter to prevent these and other harmful effects and thus to promote
and protect the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the
community.

§ 53-5. Standards and considerations for approval.
A. Every application for a building permit for the construction of any
structure within the City of Rye or for the reconstruction or alteration of
any structure, including any addition thereto, within the City of Rye that
would affect the exterior appearance of such structure shall be referred
by the Building Inspector to the Board of Architectural review within 21
days of the date of the application, provided that it conforms in all
respects to all other applicable laws and ordinances. The term
"structure" shall be construed in accordance with the legislative
findings and definitions set forth in § 53-1 of this chapter. The
requirements of this section do not apply to "small projects" as defined
in § 53-1 of this chapter and § A201-1 of the Rules of the Building
Inspector, except for small projects that require or have been granted a
variance by the Zoning Board of Appeals; or that involve a recreational
or accessory structure or facility; or when the Building Inspector refers
the small project to the Board of Architectural Review upon finding that
the small project may meet one or more of the guidelines for such
referral as prepared by the Board of Architectural Review, thereby
having a substantial aesthetic impact upon immediately neighboring
properties. The requirements of this section do not apply to additions or
alterations that meet the requirements of § 68-5F or 197-84C(5) of this
Code. [Amended 5-31-1995 by L.L. No. 6-1995]
B. Applications must be accompanied by plans showing all elevations of
new structures and all affected elevations in the case of reconstructions
or alterations. When required by the Building Inspector or by the Board
of Architectural Review, a site plan shall be submitted showing both
existing and proposed contours at two-foot intervals, all existing trees
with a trunk diameter of four inches or more at a point three feet above
the ground level and whether such trees shall remain or be removed
and/or other topographical features.
A. Approval or disapproval of any building permit shall be by a vote of a
majority of the members of the Board of Architectural Review. In
considering an application for a permit, the Board shall take into
account natural features of the site and surroundings, exterior design
and appearances of existing structures in the area and the character of
the area and its peculiar suitability for particular purposes, with a view
to conserving the values of property, encouraging the most appropriate
use of property and preventing the harmful effects referred to in § 53-1
of this chapter.
B. Findings for approval; conditions.
(1) The Board shall, subject to the provisions of Subsection B(2) of
§ 53-5, approve any application referred to it upon finding that the
11.Editor's Note: This local law provided that it shall take effect 5-1-2010.
§ 53-4 APPEARANCE TICKETS § 53-5
52:165
structure for which the permit was requested if erected,
reconstructed or altered in accordance with the submitted plan
would be in harmony with the purpose of this chapter, would not
be visually offensive or inappropriate by reason of poor quality of
exterior design, monotonous similarity or striking visual discord in
relation to the site or surroundings, would not mar the appearance
of the area, would not impair the user enjoyment and desirability
or reduce the values of properties in the area, would not be
detrimental to the character of the neighborhood, would not
prevent the most appropriate development or preservation and/or
utilization of the site or of adjacent lands or would not adversely
affect the economic stability, health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
(2) In approving any application, the Board may impose appropriate
conditions and safeguards designed to prevent the harmful effects
set forth in § 53-1 of this chapter. The Board may also suggest
interior change(s) that would improve the exterior appearance.
C. The Board may disapprove any application for a permit, provided that
the Board has afforded the applicant an opportunity to confer upon
suggestions for change of the plan, or provided that the Board finds and
states that the structure for which the permit was requested would, if
erected, reconstructed or altered as indicated, provoke one or more of
the harmful effects set forth in § 53-1 of this chapter by reason of:
(1) Excessive similarity to any other structure or structures existing or
for which a permit has been issued or to any other structure
included in the same permit application, facing the same street and
within 500 feet of the proposed site, in respect to one or more of
the following features of exterior design and appearance:
apparently identical facade; substantially identical size and
arrangement of either doors, windows, porticoes or other openings
or breaks in the facade facing the street, including reverse
arrangements; or other significant identical features, such as but
not limited to material, roofline and height or other design
elements, provided that a finding of excessive similarity shall state
not only that such similarity exists, but further that it is of such a
nature as to be expected to provoke beyond reasonable doubt one
or more of the harmful effects set forth in § 53-1 of this chapter.
(2) Excessive dissimilarity or inappropriateness in relation to any other
structure or structures existing or for which a permit has been
issued or to any other structure included in the same permit
application, within 1,000 feet of the proposed site, in respect to one
or more of the following features: cubical contents; gross floor
area; height of building or height of roof; inappropriate relationship
to the site, its contours, shape or natural characteristics;
inappropriate location of features incorporated into the structure,
including but not limited to windows, doors, chimneys, stairs,
porches, air conditioners or air-conditioning equipment, or of
§ 53-5 RYE CODE § 53-5
52:166
features ancillary to the structure, including but not limited to
antennas, toolsheds, greenhouses, patios, decks, balconies,
garages or refuse storage areas; or other significant design
features, such as material or quality or architectural design,
provided that a finding of excessive dissimilarity or
inappropriateness exists, but further that it is of such nature as to
be expected to provoke beyond a reasonable doubt one or more of
the harmful effects set forth in § 53-1 of this chapter and that the
finding is not based on personal preference as to taste or choice of
architectural style.
D. The Board of Architectural Review shall examine, review, approve or
disapprove applications for permits for the following exterior facilities:
swimming pools, jacuzzis, hot tubs, tennis courts, paddle tennis courts
and other courts (hereinafter collectively referred to as "recreational
facility" or "recreational facilities") as to the necessary screening
required by § 197-86 of the Code of the City of Rye, Table A, Column 3,
Subsections (9)(a) and (9)(b). Approval or disapproval must be by
majority vote of the total Board. A ten-foot wide landscape strip planted
and maintained with at least a double row of alternately spaced
evergreens, with an actual height of at least six feet above the natural
grade when installed, is the preferred screening method for
recreational facilities and must be approved by the Board. However, the
Board may approve alternate screening under the following conditions:
(1) There is existing landscaping on the lot between the recreational
facility and the property line equal in effectiveness, height and
density to the required evergreen screening.
(2) There is an existing six-foot-high opaque fence or wall on the lot
between the recreational facility and the property line, which is
totally owned and controlled by the lot owner and in conformity
with the fence height regulations of this chapter, provided that the
Board further finds that the increased height of matured evergreen
screening is not necessary to screen the recreational facility from
the view of the abutting property and that the fence was installed at
least two years prior to the application for the waiver.
(3) The existing topography of the lot where the recreational facility is
to be located, relative to the topography of the abutting property, is
such that the recreational facility will not be within the view of the
abutting property, provided that the Board further finds that it is
reasonable to expect that this topographic relationship will not be
adversely altered in order to facilitate future development of either
property.
(4) The soil conditions where the landscaping strip would be required
to be installed are such that the evergreens can not be expected to
survive or to properly mature, provided that the Board further finds
the recreational facility can not be reasonably placed in another
location with suitable soil conditions, and further provided that a

The Board of Architectural Review shall have the power to examine, review

for permits for signs, awnings, marquee-type awnings and canopies affixed
to any structure or erected in connection with any structure, pursuant to
§ 165-2 of the Code of the City of Rye.
six-foot-high opaque fence or wall which conforms to the fence
height regulations of this chapter will be installed between the
property line and the recreational facility in place of the
landscaping strip.
(5) Conditions do exist which are not specifically covered in Subsection
C(1) through (4) above, but which are of a similar nature, provided
that the Board further finds that approval of the waiver will not be
inconsistent with the spirit and intent of this section or less
protective of the view from the abutting properties.
(6) The approval of any alternate screening as described in Subsection
C(1) through (5) above and the acceptance of it by the owner shall
also be subject to the following limitations and conditions:
(a) A variance has not been granted by the Board of Appeals
permitting a reduction of the minimum property line setbacks
required by this chapter.
(b) The recreational facility was not constructed prior to the
application for approval, except that this limitation shall not
apply to recreational facilities constructed prior to the effective
date of the screening requirements for which an owner wishes
to seek compliance.
(c) After construction of the recreational facility, the owners of the
lot shall thereafter be required to maintain, repair and replace
such existing landscaping, fencing, walls or topographical
features which served as the basis for approval as if they were
required by this chapter in the first instance and enforced in
the same manner.
(d) The approval shall become null and void one year after its
approval by the Board of Architectural Review unless the
recreational facility has been substantially completed.
(e) The approval shall become null and void if the recreational
facility is removed.

§ 69-1. Legislative intent.
The purpose of this chapter shall be to require the clear display of house or
building numbers (hereinafter "house numbers") from public streets for all
properties that contain a principal building within the City of Rye in order
to assist the general public or the authorities in identifying any property
in case of an emergency as well as for the welfare of the general public in
conducting its normal affairs.
§ 69-2. Applicability; display of numbers.
§ 69-3. Number specifications and placement.
In order to comply with this chapter, house numbers shall be arabic in
design, shall have a minimum height of two inches and shall be mounted
in a secure fashion to the building's front wall or to a porch or other fixed
appurtenance in front of the building in the general vicinity of the main
entryway or main path of travel which leads to the main entrance from a
public or private street, or otherwise separately mounted in an approved
manner upon the face of a wall or upon a post in the front yard of the
premises. Auxiliary numbers shall be mounted a height between four feet
and 10 feet above the adjacent grade for exterior landing directly beneath
but never higher than 15 feet above the adjoining grade. They shall be
sufficiently legible as to contrasting background, arrangement, spacing,
size and uniformity of integers so that the numbers may be read with ease
during the daylight hours by a person possessing at least 20/40 vision as
he views the numbers from the center line of the facing street and at an
A. This chapter shall apply to all properties within the City of Rye that
contain a principal building thereon, whether or not said building is
occupied.
B. Such premises shall bear and display at least one set of house numbers,
which shall be assigned by the City Assessor. Buildings facing two or
more public roadways shall be required to display auxiliary numbers as
necessary, to pass the visibility test (as hereinafter set forth) when
viewed from those points in the center line of the public roadway
opposite those points where regularly used pedestrian or vehicular
passageways enter the public roadway.

elevation of five feet above the finished surface thereof. The numbers shall
be so placed that trees, shrubs or other obstructions do not block the line of
the numbers from the center of the street to any appreciable degree.
§ 69-4. Preexisting numbers.
Existing numbers used on premises which essentially comply with numbers
officially assigned by the City Assessor, at least to the extent that each
number or numbers are in logical sequence with number or numbers
assigned to properties on either side which are located on the same side of
the street, shall be considered as bearing the correct number or numbers
for the purposes of this chapter. Existing installations which essentially
meet the requirements and/or spirit of these regulations, including numbers
presently on or attached to a mailbox, may be granted approval by the City
Assessor without further alteration.
§ 69-5. Penalties for offenses.
The absence of house numbers or the insecure fastening or absence of any
integer thereof or the use of any number out of logical sequence for the
street toward which it faces or the failure of a number to meet the elevation
requirement or the visibility requirements shall be considered a violation
of this chapter. Failure on the part of the property owner to comply with
the provisions of this chapter within the period of 15 days from the date
of issuance of a notice of violation shall be sufficient cause for the City
Assessor or such representative as he may choose to proceed with carrying
out the provisions of this chapter and assess any costs incurred to the
property owner concerned, with a minimum charge of $20 for each property
in violation.
§ 69-6. Designation by Assessor.
The final authority for determining and assigning the number or numbers
to be used upon any particular property shall be the Assessor of the City of
Rye.

§ 73-1. Title.
This chapter will be known as "Chapter 73, Coastal Zone Management
Waterfront Consistency Review, of the Code of the City of Rye."
§ 73-2. Authority and purpose.
A. This chapter is adopted under the authority of the Municipal Home Rule
Law and the Waterfront Revitalization and Coastal Resources Act of the
State of New York (Article 42 of the Executive Law).
B. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a framework for agencies of
the City of Rye to consider the policies and purposes contained in the
Local Waterfront Revitalization Program when reviewing applications
for actions or direct agency actions located in the coastal area and to
ensure that such actions and direct actions are consistent with said
policies and purposes.
C. It is the intent of the City of Rye that the preservation, enhancement
and utilization of the natural and man-made resources of the unique
coastal area of the city take place in a coordinated and comprehensive
manner to ensure a proper balance between natural resources and the
need to accommodate population growth and economic development.
Accordingly, this chapter is intended to achieve such a balance,
permitting beneficial use of the coastal resources while preventing loss
of living estuarine resources and wildlife; diminution of open space
areas or public access to the waterfront; erosion of the shoreline;
impairment of scenic beauty; losses due to flooding, erosion and
sedimentation; or permanent adverse changes to the ecological
systems.
D. The substantive provisions of this chapter shall only apply while there is
in existence a City of Rye Local Waterfront Revitalization Program
which has been adopted in accordance with Article 42 of the Executive
Law of the State of New York.

§ 73-4. Review of actions.
§ 73-5. Application for determination of consistency.
A. Whenever a proposed action is located in the city's Coastal Area, an
agency shall, prior to funding or directly undertaking the action, refer
the action to the Rye City Planning Commission for a determination that
it is consistent with the LWRP policy standards and conditions set forth
in § 73-5D herein.
B. For the purposes of this chapter, a determination of consistency by the
Rye City Planning Commission shall not be required for the following
actions:
(1) Excluded, exempt and Type II actions as defined by Chapter 87,
Environmental Quality Review, of the Code of the City of Rye and
the State Environmental Quality Review Act, and as amended.
(2) Approval of an application to implement any part of an action or
approval of an action which was previously determined by the Rye
City Planning Commission to be consistent with the Rye City Local
Waterfront Revitalization Program, except when the determination
was made in connection with an amendment to the Code of the City
of Rye, including but not limited to an amendment to the Zoning
Map of the City of Rye or to Chapter 197, Zoning, of the Code of the

(5) Rye City Planning Commission Local Waterfront Revitalization
Program determinations of consistency.
(6) Legislative action taken by the City Council.
A. For actions to be directly undertaken by the City of Rye, the agency
proposing the action shall, as early as possible in the formulation of the
action, refer the proposed action to the Planning Commission for a
determination of consistency and shall not implement such action until
the Planning Commission has issued such determination of consistency.
B. For applications by persons, firms and corporations to a city agency for
approval, the applicant, when making the application to such agency,
shall simultaneously apply to the Planning Commission for a
determination of consistency. The applicant shall prepare a Coastal
§ 73-3 RYE CODE § 73-5
73:204
Assessment Form (CAF) to assist with the consistency review. In the
case of application processes which require preliminary and final
applications, the application for a determination of consistency shall
be made with the application for preliminary approval and need not
be reapplied for at the time of making a final application unless the
scope of the project for which final approval is sought is substantially
different from that of the application for preliminary approval, which
determination shall be made by the agency to which the application is
being made.
C. Except as provided for below, the Planning Commission shall make the
determination of consistency based on the CAF and such other
information as is deemed to be necessary in its determination. The
Planning Commission shall issue its determination following the next
regularly scheduled meeting. The Planning Commission shall have the
authority, in its finding of consistency, to impose practicable and
reasonable conditions on an action to ensure that it is carried out in
accordance with this chapter. Where the agency is the City Council or,
in consideration of applications for use and area variances, the Board of
Appeals, the determination of the Planning Commission shall be
advisory. The consistency of an action involving the City Council or the
Board of Appeals shall be determined by these Boards in the process of
reviewing the proposed action. However, both Boards shall obtain the
recommendations of the Planning Commission, as provided in this
chapter, prior to reaching a decision. Both Boards shall have the
authority, in their findings of consistency, to impose practicable and
reasonable conditions on an action to ensure that it is carried out in
accordance with this chapter. The Planning Commission shall be the
agency authorized to make final consistency determinations for all
other actions by agencies of the City of Rye.
D. Actions to be undertaken within the Coastal Area shall be evaluated for
consistency in accordance with the following LWRP policy standards
and conditions, which are derived from and further explained and
described in Section III of the Rye City LWRP, a copy of which is on file
in the City Clerk's office and available for inspection during normal
business hours. In the case of direct actions, the agency shall also
consult with Section IV of the LWRP in making its consistency
determination. The action shall be consistent with the policy to:
(1) Revitalize deteriorated and under utilized waterfront areas (Policy
1).
(2) Retain and promote recreational water-dependent uses (Policy 2).
(3) Strengthen the economic base of smaller harbor areas by

first offense and punishable by a fine of $1,000 for a conviction of
a second or subsequent offense. For the purpose of conferring
jurisdiction upon courts and judicial officers, each week of the
continuing violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
B. The City Corporation Counsel is authorized and directed to institute any
and all actions and proceedings necessary to enforce this chapter. Any
civil penalty shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any criminal
prosecution and penalty.
A. It is the policy of both the City of Rye and the State of New York to
reduce costs and provide cost certainty for the purpose of economic
development, to promote deeper penetration of energy efficiency and
renewable energy resources such as wind and solar, and wider
deployment of distributed energy resources as well as to examine the
retail energy markets and increase participation of and benefits for
residential and small commercial customers in those markets. Among
the policies and models that may offer benefits in New York is
community choice aggregation (CCA), which allows local governments
to determine the default supplier of electricity and natural gas on
behalf of its residential and small commercial customers.
B. The purpose of this CCA Program is to allow participating local
governments, including the City of Rye, to procure energy supply
service for their residential and small commercial customers, who will
have the opportunity to opt out of the procurement, while maintaining
transmission and distribution service from the existing distribution
utility. This chapter establishes a program that will allow the City of Rye
to put out for bid the total amount of natural gas and/or electricity being
purchased by local residential and small commercial customers.
Bundled customers will have the opportunity to have more control to
lower their overall energy costs, to spur clean energy innovation and
investment, to improve customer choice and value, and to protect the
environment, thereby fulfilling the purposes of this chapter and
fulfilling an important public purpose.

For purposes of this chapter, and unless otherwise expressly stated or
unless the context otherwise requires, the terms in this chapter shall have

§ 74-4. Procedures for Eligibility; Customer Data Sharing.
A. A Community Choice Aggregation (Energy) Program is hereby
established by the City of Rye, whereby the City of Rye shall work
together with Sustainable Westchester to implement the CCA Program
to the full extent permitted by the Order, as set forth more fully herein.
The City of Rye role under the CCA Program involves the aggregating of
the electric and/or gas supply of its residents and the entering into a
contract with one or more suppliers for supply and services. Under the
CCA Program, the operation and ownership of the utility service shall
remain with the distribution utility.
B. The City of Rye participation in a CCA Program constitutes neither the
purchase of a public utility system nor the furnishing of utility service.
The City of Rye will not take over any part of the electric or gas
transmission or distribution system and will not furnish any type of
utility service but will instead negotiate with suppliers on behalf of
participating residential and small commercial customers.
C. In order to implement the CCA Program, the City of Rye will adopt one
or more resolutions that outline the process of and conditions for
participation in the CCA Program, including but not limited to signing a
contract for a compliant bid with one or more suppliers, all as
consistent with the local law and the Order.
D. The Public Service Commission supervises retail markets and
participants in these markets through legislative and regulatory
authority and the Uniform Business Practices, which includes rules
relating to the eligibility of participating ESCOs, the operation by which
ESCOs provide energy services and the terms on which customers may
be enrolled with ESCOs.
A. As permitted by the Order, the City of Rye may request from the
distribution utilities aggregated customer information by fuel type and
service classification on a rolling basis.
B. Sustainable Westchester, on behalf of the City of Rye, shall issue one or
more requests for proposals to suppliers to provide energy to
participants and may then award a contract in accordance with the CCA
Program.
C. Sustainable Westchester or the City of Rye, if the City of Rye so
chooses, will then request individual customer data from the
distribution utility in accordance with the CCA Program.

§ 74-5. Choice of energy supplier; opt-out notice and procedure.
§ 74-6. Verification and reporting.
Sustainable Westchester shall be responsible for filing an annual report
with the Public Service Commission that identifies the number of customers
enrolled in the CCA Program by municipality and customer class, the
number of customers who returned to utility service or service with another
supplier during the reporting period, and the average cost of commodity
supply by month for the reporting period.
D. Sustainable Westchester or the City of Rye, if the City of Rye so
chooses, and the selected supplier will then notify bundled customers of
the contract terms and their opportunity to opt out of the CCA Program.
E. In accordance with and for purposes of the Order, Con Ed will provide
to Sustainable Westchester aggregate and customer-specific data
(including usage data, capacity tag obligations, account numbers, and
service addresses) of all bundled customers in the City of Rye not
currently enrolled with an individually chosen ESCO.
F. Sustainable Westchester and the City of Rye will protect customer
information as required by law, subject to the Order and the limitations
of the New York State Freedom of Information Law.
A. The City of Rye, or in conjunction with the ESCO, will notify its
residential and small commercial customers, by letter notice, of the City
of Rye to establish the CCA Program, of the contract terms with an
ESCO, and of the opportunity to opt out of the CCA Program.
B. The letter notice will be sent to each customer at the address provided
by the distribution utility and explain the CCA Program and the
material provisions of the ESCO contract, identify the methods by
which the customer can opt out of the CCA Program, and provide
information on how the customer can access additional information
about the CCA Program.
C. The opt-out period shall be at least 20 days.
D. CCA Program bundled customers, upon enrollment, will receive a
welcome letter that will explain the customers' options for canceling
the enrollment if they believe they were enrolled incorrectly or
otherwise decide to withdraw from the CCA Program in favor of another
supplier. The welcome letter also will explain that residential customers
are entitled to the added protection of the mandated three-day
rescission period as detailed in Section 5(B)(3) of the Uniform Business
Practices.

A. An Energize NY Open C-PACE Financing Program is hereby established
by the Municipality, whereby EIC, acting on its behalf pursuant to the
Municipal Agreement, may arrange for the provision of funds by
Financing Parties to Qualified Property Owners in accordance with the
Enabling Act and the procedures set forth under this chapter to finance
the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and installation of
Qualified Projects and Eligible Costs and Financing Charges approved
by EIC and by the Financing Party under the Finance Agreement. EIC,
on behalf of the Municipality, and with the consent of the Benefited
Property Owner, will record a Benefit Assessment Lien on the Benefited

§ 84-7. Terms and conditions of repayment.
The Finance Agreement shall set forth the terms and conditions of
repayment in accordance with the following:
A. A Qualified Property Owner may participate in the Program through the
execution of a finance agreement made by and between the Qualified
Property Owner and a Financing Party, to which EIC, on behalf of the
Municipality, shall be a third-party beneficiary (the "Finance
Agreement"). Upon execution and delivery of the Finance Agreement,
the property that is the subject of the Finance Agreement shall be
deemed a "Benefited Property."
B. Upon execution and delivery of the Finance Agreement, the Benefited
Property Owner shall be eligible to receive funds from the Financing
Party for the acquisition, construction, and installation of a Qualified
Project, together with Eligible Costs and Financing Charges approved
by EIC and by the Financing Party, provided the requirements of the
Enabling Act, the Municipal Agreement and this chapter have been
met.
C. The Finance Agreement shall include the terms and conditions of
repayment of the Secured Amount and the Annual Installment Amounts.
D. EIC may charge fees to offset the costs of administering the Program,
and such fees, if not paid by the Financing Party, shall be added to the

A. The principal amount of the funds loaned to the Benefited Property
Owner for the Qualified Project, together with Eligible Costs and
Financing Charges approved by EIC and by the Financing Party, shall
be specially assessed against the Benefited Property and will be
evidenced by a Benefit Assessment Lien recorded against the Benefited
Property on the land records on which liens are recorded for properties
within the Municipality. The special benefit assessment shall constitute
a "charge" within the meaning of the Enabling Act and shall be
collected in annual installments in the amounts certified by the
Financing Party in a schedule provided at closing and made part of the
Benefit Assessment Lien. Said amount shall be annually levied, billed
and collected by EIC, on behalf of the Municipality, and shall be paid to
the Financing Party as provided in the Finance Agreement.
B. The term of such repayment shall be determined at the time the
Finance Agreement is executed by the Benefited Property Owner and
the Financing Party, not to exceed the weighted average of the useful
life of the systems and improvements as determined by EIC, acting on
behalf of the Municipality.

§ 84-8. Levy of annual installment amount and creation of annual
installment lien.
C. The rate of interest for the Secured Amount shall be fixed by the
Financing Party in conjunction with EIC, acting on behalf of the
Municipality, as provided in the Finance Agreement.
A. Upon the making of the loan pursuant to the Finance Agreement, the
Secured Amount shall become a special Benefit Assessment Lien on the
Benefited Property in favor of the Municipality. The amount of the
Benefit Assessment Lien shall be the Secured Amount. Evidence of the
Benefit Assessment Lien shall be recorded by EIC, on behalf of the
Municipality, in the land records for properties in the Municipality. Such
recording shall be exempt from any charge, mortgage recording tax or
other fee in the same manner as if recorded by the Municipality. The
Benefit Assessment Lien shall not be foreclosed upon by or otherwise
enforced by the Municipality.
B. The Finance Agreement shall provide for the repayment of the Secured
Amount in installments made at least annually, as provided in a
schedule attached to the Benefit Assessment Lien (the "Annual
Installment Amount"). The Annual Installment Amount shall be levied
by EIC, on behalf of the Municipality, on the Benefited Property in the
same manner as levies for municipal charges, shall become a lien on the
Benefited Property as of the first day of January of the fiscal year for
which levied (the "Annual Installment Lien") and shall remain a lien
until paid. The creation or any recording of the Annual Installment Lien
shall be exempt from any charge, mortgage recording tax or other fee
in the same manner as if recorded by the Municipality. Payment to the
Financing Party shall be considered payment for this purpose. Such
payment shall partly or wholly discharge the Annual Installment Lien.
Delinquent Annual Installment Amounts may accrue Financing Charges
as may be provided in the Finance Agreement. Any additional Financing
Charges imposed by the Financing Party pursuant to the Finance
Agreement shall increase the Annual Installment Amount and the
Annual Installment Lien for the year in which such overdue payments
were first due.
C. The Benefit Assessment Lien shall be reduced annually by the amount
of each Annual Installment Lien when each Annual Installment Lien
becomes a lien. Each Annual Installment Lien shall be subordinate to all
Municipal Liens, whether created by § 902 of the RPTL or by any other
State or local law. No portion of a Secured Amount shall be recovered
by the Municipality, EIC, or an assignee upon foreclosure, sale or other
disposition of the Benefited Property unless and until all Municipal
Liens are fully discharged. Each Annual Installment Lien, however,
shall have priority over all Nonmunicipal Liens, irrespective of when
created, except as otherwise required by law.
D. Neither the Benefit Assessment Lien nor any Annual Installment Lien
shall be extinguished or accelerated in the event of a default or

Improvements financed by the Program in such form and manner as the
Authority may establish.
§ 84-10. Severability.
If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or part of this chapter shall
be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such
judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder thereof, but
shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,

bankruptcy of the Benefited Property Owner. Each Annual Installment
Amount shall be considered a charge upon the Benefited Property and
shall be collected by EIC, on behalf of the Municipality, at the same time
and in the same manner as real property taxes or municipal charges.
Each Annual Installment Lien shall remain a lien until paid. Amounts
collected in respect of an Annual Installment Lien shall be remitted to
EIC, on behalf of the Municipality, or the Financing Party, as may be
provided in the Finance Agreement.
E. EIC shall act as the Municipality's agent in collection of the Annual
Installment Amounts. If any Benefited Property Owner fails to pay an
Annual Installment Amount, the Financing Party may redeem the
Benefited Property by paying the amount of all unpaid Municipal Liens
thereon, and thereafter shall have the right to collect any amounts in
respect of an Annual Installment Lien by foreclosure or any other
remedy available at law. Any foreclosure shall not affect any subsequent
Annual Installment Liens.
F. EIC, on behalf of the Municipality, may sell or assign for consideration
any and all Benefit Assessment Liens and Annual Installment Liens to
Financing Parties that provide financing to Qualified Properties
pursuant to Finance Agreements. The Financing Parties may sell or
assign for consideration any and all Benefit Assessment Liens and
Annual Installment Liens received from EIC, on behalf of the
Municipality, subject to certain conditions provided in the
administration agreement between EIC and the Financing Party. The
assignee or assignees of such Benefit Assessment Liens and Annual
Installment Liens shall have and possess the same powers and rights at
law or in equity as the Municipality would have had if the Benefit
Assessment Lien and the Annual Installment Liens had not been
assigned with regard to the precedence and priority of such lien, the
accrual of interest and the fees and expenses of collection.

generally applicable in the State of New York for the granting of a variance
from enforcement of provisions of a zoning ordinance limiting the height of
structures located in a residential district. In making a determination on an
appeal, the Board may consider the unusual amount of automobile traffic on

designed with four lanes for use by vehicles is presumed to have an unusual
amount of traffic.

Surface water control  See Ch. 173.
Zoning  See Ch. 197.
§ 100-1. Statutory authorization and purpose.
A. Findings. The City Council of the City of Rye finds that the potential
and/or actual damages from flooding and erosion may be a problem to
the residents of the City of Rye and that such damages may include:
destruction or loss of private and public housing, damage to public
facilities, both publicly and privately owned, and injury to and loss of
human life. In order to minimize the threat of such damages and to
achieve the purposes and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter
is adopted.
B. Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
(1) Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property
due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of floodwaters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase erosion or flood damages;
(5) Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally
divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
(6) Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
C. Objectives.
(1) To protect human life and health;

of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO, AH or VO Zone on
a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percent or
greater annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of one foot to
three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path
of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOODING HAZARD  The land in the floodplain within
a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. This area may be designated as Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-A30,
A99, V, VO, VE, or V1-V30. It is also commonly referred to as the "base
floodplain" or "l00-year floodplain." For purposes of this chapter, the term
"special flood hazard area (SFHA)" is synonymous in meaning with the
phrase "area of special flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  That portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL  A wall that is not part of the structural support of
the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse
(2) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, sewer lines, streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize
future flood blight areas;
(7) To provide that developers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
(8) To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.

top of the elevated floor or, in the case of a building in Zone V1-30, VE,
or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the
elevated floor, elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns
(posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water and (ii)
adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the
building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case
of Zone A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or D, "elevated building" also
includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter
walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of
floodwaters. In the case of Zone V1-V30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also

A. This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the City of Rye, Westchester County.
B. Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard.
(1) The areas of special flood hazard for the City of Rye, Community
Number 360931, are identified and defined on the following
documents prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency:
(a) Flood Insurance Rate Map Panel Numbers 36119C0352F,
36119C0354F, 36119C0356F, 36119C0357F, 36119C0358F,

and any subsequent revisions to these map panels that do not
affect areas under our community's jurisdiction.
(b) A scientific and engineering report entitled "Flood Insurance
Study, Westchester County, New York, All Jurisdictions," dated
September 28, 2007.
§ 100-2 FIREARMS § 100-3
95:319
(c) Letter of Map Revision, Case Number 18-02-1994P, effective
May 2, 2019, amending Flood Insurance Rate Map Panel
36119C0354F. [Added 3-27-2019 by L.L. No. 3-2019]
(2) The above documents are hereby adopted and declared to be a part
of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study and/or maps are on file
at the City of Rye.
C. Interpretation and conflict with other laws. This chapter includes all
revisions to the National Flood Insurance Program through March 20,
1997, and shall supersede all previous laws adopted for the purpose of
flood damage prevention. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements,
adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare.
Whenever the requirements of this chapter are at variance with the
requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations,
ordinances, or local laws, the most restrictive, or that imposing the
higher standards, shall govern.
D. Severability. The invalidity of any section or provision of this chapter
shall not invalidate any other section or provision thereof.
E. Penalties for noncompliance. No structure in an area of special flood
hazard shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or
altered and no land shall be excavated or filled without full compliance
with the terms of this chapter and any other applicable regulations. Any
infraction of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any
of its requirements, including infractions of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with conditions of the permit, shall constitute
a violation. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined no more
than $250 or imprisoned for not more than 15 days, or both. Each day of
noncompliance shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the City of Rye from taking such other lawful
action as necessary to prevent or remedy an infraction. Any structure
found not compliant with the requirements of this chapter for which the
developer and/or owner has not applied for and received an approved
variance under § 100-6 will be declared noncompliant and notification
shall be sent to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
F. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.
Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may
be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the area of special flood hazards or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of
Rye, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

all construction and other development to be undertaken in areas
of special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of
protecting its citizens from increased flood hazards and ensuring
that new development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its
exposure to flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any
development in an area of special flood hazard, as shown on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map enumerated in § 100-3B, without a valid
floodplain development permit. Application for a permit shall be
made on forms furnished by the local administrator and may
include, but not be limited to: plans, in duplicate, drawn to scale
and showing: the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of
the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of
materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing.
(2) Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee to be set by the City Council
annually by resolution. In addition, the applicant shall be
responsible for reimbursing the City of Rye for any additional costs
necessary for review, inspection and approval of this project. The
local administrator may require a deposit of no more than $500 to
cover these additional costs.
C. Application for a permit. The applicant shall provide the following
information as appropriate. Additional information may be required on
the permit application form.
(1) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest
floor (including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially
improved structure to be located in Zone A1-A30, AE or AH, or
Zone A if base flood elevation data are available. Upon completion
of the lowest floor, the permittee shall submit to the local
administrator the as-built elevation, certified by a licensed
professional engineer or surveyor.
(2) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the bottom
of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding
pilings and columns) of any new or substantially improved
structure to be located in Zone V1-V30 or VE, or Zone V if base
flood elevation data are available. Upon completion of the lowest
floor, the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the asbuilt

following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(a) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 100-4C, Application for a permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(b) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If
a proposed building site is located in an area of special flood
hazard, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall meet the applicable standards of § 100-5, Construction
standards, and, in particular, § 100-5A(2), Subdivision
proposals.
(c) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of

property (e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood
velocities). The local administrator may require the applicant
to submit additional technical analyses and data necessary to
complete the determination. If the proposed development may
result in physical damage to any other property or fails to meet
the applicable requirements of § 100-5, Construction
standards, no permit shall be issued. The applicant may revise
the application to include measures that mitigate or eliminate
the adverse effects and resubmit the application.
(d) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required
by state or federal law.
(2) Use of other flood data.
(a) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has
designated areas of special flood hazard on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate map (FIRM) but has neither produced
water surface elevation data (these areas are designated Zone
A or V on the FIRM) nor identified a floodway, the local
administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
§ 100-4 FIREARMS § 100-4
95:323
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state or other source, including data developed
pursuant to § 100-4C(7), as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(b) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the
purposes of this chapter.
(3) Alteration of watercourses.
(a) The local administrator shall notify adjacent communities and
the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation prior to permitting any alteration or relocation of
a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the
Regional Director, Region II, Federal Emergency Management
Agency.

holder has provided for maintenance within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying
capacity is not diminished.
(c) Determine compliance with Chapter 195, Wetlands and
Watercourses, of the Rye City Code.
(4) Construction stage.
(a) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor
or completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially
improved structure, the local administrator shall obtain from
the permit holder a certification of the as-built elevation of the
lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, in relation to mean sea
level. The certificate shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a licensed land surveyor or professional
engineer and certified by same. For manufactured homes, the
permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation upon
placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of elevation
must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains
on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully
licensed and ready for highway use).
(b) In Zones V1-V30 and VE, and also Zone V if base flood elevation
data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor of a new
or substantially improved structure, the permit holder shall
submit to the local administrator a certificate of elevation, in
relation to mean sea level, of the bottom of the lowest
structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and
§ 100-4 RYE CODE § 100-4
95:324
columns). For manufactured homes, the permit holder shall
submit the certificate of elevation upon placement of the
structure on the site. An elevation certificate must also be
submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a site 180
consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed and ready
for highway use).
(c) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval
of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies
detected shall be cause to issue a stop work order for the
project unless immediately corrected.

engineer or architect shall make periodic inspections at
appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order to
monitor compliance with permit conditions and enable said
inspector to certify, if requested, that the development is in
compliance with the requirements of the floodplain development
permit and/or any variance provisions.
(6) Stop-work orders.
(a) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a
stop-work order for any floodplain development found ongoing
without a development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order
shall subject the violator to the penalties described in § 100-3E.
(b) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a
stop-work order for any floodplain development found
noncompliant with the provisions of this chapter and/or the
conditions of the development permit. Disregard of a stop-work
order shall subject the violator to the penalties described in
§ 100-3E.
(7) Certificate of compliance.
(a) In areas of special flood hazard, as determined by documents
enumerated in § 100-3B, it shall be unlawful to occupy or to
permit the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or
both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed,
converted or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use or
structure until a certificate of compliance has been issued by
the local administrator stating that the building or land
conforms to the requirements of this chapter.
(b) A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the local
administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development
in areas of special flood hazard.

minimize flood damage.
(c) For enclosed areas below the lowest floor of a structure within
Zone A1-A30, AE or AH, and also Zone A if base flood elevation
data are available, new and substantially improved structures
shall have fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage
in an area other than a basement and which are subject to
flooding, designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either
be certified by a licensed professional engineer or architect or
meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: (i) a minimum
of two openings having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding; and (ii) the bottom of all such openings no higher
than one foot above the lowest adjacent finished grade.
Openings may be equipped with louvers, valves, screens or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters. Enclosed areas subgrade on all
sides are considered basements and are not permitted.
(d) Within Zones V1-V30 and VE, and also within Zone V if base
flood elevation are available, new construction and substantial
improvements shall have the space below the lowest floor
either free from obstruction or constructed with nonsupporting
breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work or insect screening
intended to collapse under wind and water loads without
causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to
the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation
system. The enclosed space below the lowest floor shall be
used only for parking vehicles, building access or storage. Use
of this space for human habitation is expressly prohibited. The
construction of stairs, stairwells and elevator shafts are subject
to the design requirements for breakaway walls.
(3) Utilities.
(a) New and replacement electrical equipment, heating,
ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing connections, and other
service equipment shall be located at or above the base flood
elevation. Electrical wiring and outlets, switches, junction
boxes and panels shall be elevated to or above the base flood
elevation unless they conform to the appropriate provisions of
the electrical part of the Building Code of New York State or
the Residential Code of New York State for location of such
items in wet locations;
§ 100-5 FIREARMS § 100-5
95:329
(b) New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
system;
(c) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters.
Sanitary sewer and storm drainage systems for buildings that
have openings below the base flood elevation shall be provided
with automatic backflow valves or other automatic backflow
devices that are installed in each discharge line passing
through a building's exterior wall; and
(d) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during
flooding.
C. Residential structures (except coastal high-hazard areas). The following
standards apply to new and substantially improved commercial,
industrial and other nonresidential structures, in addition to the
requirements in § 100-5A(1), Subdivision proposals, § 100-5A(2),
Encroachments, and § 100-5B, Standards for all structures.
(1) Elevation. The following standards, in addition to the standards in
§ 100-5A(1), Subdivision proposals, § 100-5A(2), Encroachments,
and § 100-5B, Standards for all structures, apply to structures
located in areas of special flood hazard as indicated:
(a) Within Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, new construction and substantial
improvements shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated at least two feet above the base flood level.
(b) Within Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available,
new and substantially improved structures shall have the
lowest floor (including basement) elevated at least three feet
above the highest adjacent grade.
(c) Within Zone AO, new and substantially improved structures
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated
above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as two feet
above the depth number specified in feet on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map enumerated in § 100-3B (at least
two feet if no depth number is specified).
(d) Within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths are
required to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures on slopes.
D. Residential structures (coastal high-hazard area). The following
standards, in addition to the standards in § 100-5A(1), Coastal highhazard
areas, and § 100-5A(2), Subdivision proposals, and § 100-5B,
Standards for all structures, apply to structures located in areas of
§ 100-5 RYE CODE § 100-5
95:330
special flood hazard shown as Zone V1-V30, VE or V on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map designated in § 100-3B:
(1) Elevation. New construction and substantial improvements shall be
elevated on pilings, columns or shear walls such that the bottom of
the lowest horizontal structural member supporting the lowest
elevated floor (excluding columns, piles, diagonal bracing attached
to the piles or columns, grade beams, pile caps and other members
designed to either withstand storm action or break away without
imparting damaging loads to the structure) is elevated at least two
feet above base flood level so as not to impede the flow of water.
(2) Determination of loading forces. Structural design shall consider
the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously during
the base flood on all building components.
(a) The structural design shall be adequate to resist water forces
that would occur during the base flood. Horizontal water loads
considered shall include inertial and drag forces of waves,
current drag forces, and impact forces from waterborne storm
debris. Dynamic uplift loads shall also be considered if
bulkheads, walls, or other natural or man-made flow
obstructions could cause wave run-up beyond the elevation of
the base flood.
(b) Buildings shall be designed and constructed to resist the forces
due to wind pressure. Wind forces on the superstructure
include windward and leeward forces on vertical walls, uplift
on the roof, internal forces when openings allow wind to enter
the house, and upward force on the underside of the house
when it is exposed. In the design, the wind should be assumed
to blow potentially from any lateral direction relative to the
house.
(c) Wind loading values used shall be those required by the
building code.
(3) Foundation standards.
(a) The pilings or column foundation and structure attached
thereto shall be adequately anchored to resist flotation,
collapse or lateral movement due to the effects of wind and
water pressures acting simultaneously on all building
components. Foundations must be designed to transfer safely
to the underlying soil all loads due to wind, water, dead load,
live load and other loads (including uplift due to wind and
water).
(b) Spread footings and fill material shall not be used for
structural support of a new building or substantial
improvement of an existing structure.
§ 100-5 FIREARMS § 100-5
95:331
(4) Pile foundation design.
(a) The design ratio of pile spacing to pile diameter shall not be
less than 8:1 for individual piles (this shall not apply to pile
clusters located below the design grade). The maximum
center-to-center spacing of wood piles shall not be more than
12 feet on center under load-bearing sills, beams, or girders.
(b) Pilings shall have adequate soil penetration (bearing capacity)
to resist the combined wave and wind loads (lateral and uplift)
associated with the base flood acting simultaneously with
typical structure (live and dead) loads, and shall include
consideration of decreased resistance capacity caused by
erosion of soil strata surrounding the piles. The minimum
penetration for foundation piles is to an elevation of five feet
below mean sea level (msl) datum if the BFE is +10 msl or less,
or to be at least 10 feet below msl if the BFE is greater than
+10 msl.
(c) Pile foundation analysis shall also include consideration of
piles in column action from the bottom of the structure to the
stable soil elevation of the site. Pilings may be horizontally or
diagonally braced to withstand wind and water forces.
(d) The minimum acceptable sizes for timber piles are a tip
diameter of eight inches for round timber piles and eight
inches by eight inches for square timber piles. All wood piles
must be treated in accordance with requirements of EPEE-C3
to minimize decay and damage from fungus.
(e) Reinforced concrete piles shall be cast of concrete having a
twenty-eight-day ultimate compressive strength of not less
than 5,000 pounds per square inch, and shall be reinforced
with a minimum of four longitudinal steel bars having a
combined area of not less than 1% nor more than 4% of the
gross concrete area. Reinforcing for precast piles shall have a
concrete cover of not less than 1 1/4 inches for No. 5 bars and
smaller and not less than 1 1/2 inches for No. 6 through No. 11
bars. Reinforcement for piles cast in the field shall have a
concrete cover of not less than two inches.
(f) Piles shall be driven by means of a pile driver or drop hammer,
jetted, or augered into place.
(g) Additional support for piles in the form of bracing may include
lateral or diagonal bracing between piles.
(h) When necessary, piles shall be braced at the ground line in
both directions by a wood timber grade beam or a reinforced
concrete grade beam. These at-grade supports should be
securely attached to the piles to provide support even if
scoured from beneath.
§ 100-5 RYE CODE § 100-5
95:332
(i) Diagonal bracing between piles, consisting of two-inch by
eight-inch (minimum) members bolted to the piles, shall be
limited in location to below the lowest supporting structural
member and above the stable soil elevation, and aligned in the
vertical plane along pile rows perpendicular to the shoreline.
Galvanized steel rods (minimum diameter 1/2 inch) or cabletype
bracing is permitted in any plane.
(j) Knee braces, which stiffen both the upper portion of a pile and
the beam-to-pile connection, may be used along pile rows
perpendicular and parallel to the shoreline. Knee braces shall
be two-by-eight lumber bolted to the sides of the pile/beam, or
four-by-four or larger braces framed into the pile/beam.
Bolting shall consist of two 5/8-inch galvanized steel bolts
(each end) for two-by-eight members, or one 5/8-inch lag bolt
(each end) for square members. Knee braces shall not extend
more than three feet below the elevation of the base flood.
(5) Column foundation design. Masonry piers or poured-in-place
concrete piers shall be internally reinforced to resist vertical and
lateral loads, and be connected with a movement-resisting
connection to a pile cap or pile shaft.
(6) Connectors and fasteners. Galvanized metal connectors, wood
connectors, or bolts of size and number adequate for the calculated
loads must be used to connect adjoining components of a structure.
Toe nailing as a principal method of connection is not permitted. All
metal connectors and fasteners used in exposed locations shall be
steel, hot-dipped galvanized after fabrication. Connectors in
protected interior locations shall be fabricated from galvanized
sheet.
(7) Beam to pile connections. The primary floor beams or girders shall
span the supports in the direction parallel to the flow of potential
floodwater and wave action and shall be fastened to the columns or
pilings by bolting, with or without cover plates. Concrete members
shall be connected by reinforcement, if cast in place, or (of precast)
shall be securely connected by bolting and welding. If sills, beams,
or girders are attached to wood piling at a notch, a minimum of two
5/8-inch galvanized steel bolts or two hot-dipped galvanized straps
3/16 inch by four inches by 18 inches, each bolted with two 1/2-inch
lag bolts per beam member, shall be used. Notching of pile tops
shall be the minimum sufficient to provide ledge support for beam
members without unduly weakening pile connections. Piling shall
not be notched so that the cross-section is reduced below 50%.
(8) Floor and deck connections.
(a) Wood two-inch by four-inch (minimum) connectors or metal
joist anchors shall be used to tie floor joists to floor beams/
girders. These should be installed on alternate floor joists, at a
§ 100-5 FIREARMS § 100-5
95:333
minimum. Cross bridging of all floor joists shall be provided.
Such cross-bridging may be one-inch by three-inch members,
placed eight feet on-center maximum, or solid bridging of the
same depth as joist at same spacing.
(b) Plywood should be used for subflooring and attic flooring to
provide good torsional resistance in the horizontal plane of the
structure. The plywood should not be less than 3/4-inch total
thickness, and should be exterior grade and fastened to beams
or joists with 8d annular or spiral thread galvanized nails. Such
fastening shall be supplemented by the application of
waterproof industrial adhesive applied to all bearing surfaces.
(9) Exterior wall connections. All bottom plates shall have any required
breaks under a wall stud or an anchor bolt. Approved anchors will
be used to secure rafters or joists and top and bottom plates to
studs in exterior and bearing walls to form a continuous tie.
Continuous 15/32-inch or thicker plywood sheathing, overlapping
the top wall plate and continuing down to the sill, beam, or girder,
may be used to provide the continuous tie. If the sheets of plywood
are not vertically continuous, then two-by-four nailer blocking shall
be provided at all horizontal joints. In lieu of the plywood,
galvanized steel rods of 1/2-inch diameter or galvanized steel
straps not less than one inch wide by 1/16 inch thick may be used to
connect from the top wall plate to the sill, beam, or girder. Washers
with a minimum diameter of three inches shall be used at each end
of the 1/2-inch round rods. These anchors shall be installed no more
than two feet from each corner rod, no more than four feet on
center.
(10) Ceiling joist/rafter connections.

that the joists provide a continuous tie across the rafters.
Ceiling joists and rafters shall be securely fastened at their
intersections. A metal or wood connector shall be used at
alternate ceiling joist/rafter connections to the wall top plate.
(b) Gable roofs shall be additionally stabilized by installing two-byfour
blocking on two-foot centers between the rafters at each
gable end. Blocking shall be installed a minimum of eight feet
toward the house interior from each gable end.
(11) Projecting members. All cantilevers and other projecting members
must be adequately supported and braced to withstand wind and
water uplift forces. Roof eave overhangs shall be limited to a
maximum of two feet and joist overhangs to a maximum of one foot.

§ 100-5 RYE CODE § 100-5
95:334
(a) Plywood, or other wood material, when used as roof sheathing,
shall not be less than 15/32 inch in thickness, and shall be of
exterior sheathing grade or equivalent. All attaching devices
for sheathing and roof coverings shall be galvanized or be of
other suitable corrosion-resistant material.
(b) All corners, gable ends, and roof overhangs exceeding six
inches shall be reinforced by the application of waterproof
industrial adhesive applied to all bearing surfaces of any
plywood sheet used in the sheathing of such corner, gable end,
or roof overhang.
(c) In addition, roofs should be sloped as steeply as practicable to
reduce uplift pressures, and special care should be used in
securing ridges, hips, valleys, eaves, vents, chimneys, and
other points of discontinuity in the roofing surface.
(13) Protection of openings. All exterior glass panels, windows, and
doors shall be designed, detailed, and constructed to withstand
loads due to the design wind speed of 110 miles per hour.
Connections for these elements must be designed to transfer safely
the design loads to the supporting structure. Panel widths of
multiple-panel sliding glass doors shall not exceed three feet.
(14) Breakaway wall design standards.
(a) The breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance
of not less than 10 pounds per square foot and not more than
20 pounds per square foot, with the criterion that the safety of
the overall structure at the point of wall failure be confirmed
using established procedures. Grade beams shall be installed
in both directions for all piles considered to carry the
breakaway wall load. Knee braces are required for front row
piles that support breakaway walls.
(b) Use of breakaway wall strengths in excess of 20 pounds per
square foot shall not be permitted unless a registered
professional engineer or architect has developed or reviewed
the structural design and specifications for the building
foundation and breakaway wall components, and certifies that
(1) the breakaway walls will fail under water loads less than
those that would occur during the base flood; and (2) the
elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation
system will not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other
structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads
acting simultaneously on all building components (structural
and nonstructural). Water loading values used shall be those
associated with the base flood. Wind loading values shall be
those required by the building code.
E. Nonresidential structures (except coastal high-hazard areas). The
following standards apply to new and substantially improved
§ 100-5 FIREARMS § 100-5
95:335
commercial, industrial and other nonresidential structures, in addition
to the requirements in § 100-5A(1), Subdivision proposals, § 100-5A(2),
Encroachments, and § 100-5B, Standards for all structures.
(1) Within Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, new construction and substantial
improvements of any nonresidential structure, together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall either:
(a) Have the lowest floor, including basement or cellar, elevated to
or above two feet above the base flood elevation; or
(b) Be floodproofed so that the structure is watertight below two
feet above the base flood level with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water. All structural
components located below the base flood level must be capable
of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects
of buoyancy.
(2) Within Zone AO, new construction and substantial improvements of
nonresidential structures shall:
(a) Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as two feet above the
depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at
least two feet if no depth number is specified); or
(b) Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
completely floodproofed to that level to meet the floodproofing
standard specified in § 100-5E(1)(b).
(3) If the structure is to be floodproofed, a licensed professional
engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design,
specifications, and plans for construction. A floodproofing
certificate or other certification shall be provided to the local
administrator that certifies the design and methods of construction
are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting
the provisions of this chapter, including the specific elevation (in
relation to mean sea level) to which the structure is to be
floodproofed.
(4) Within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths are required to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures on
slopes.
(5) Within Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available, the
lowest floor (including basement) shall be elevated at least three
feet above the highest adjacent grade.
F. Standards for nonresidential structures within coastal high-hazard
areas. In Zones V1-V30 and VE, and also Zone V if base flood elevations
are available, new construction and substantial improvements of any
§ 100-5 RYE CODE § 100-5
95:336
§ 100-6. Variance procedure.
nonresidential structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall have the bottom of the lowest member of the lowest
floor elevated to or above the base flood elevation. Floodproofing of
structures is not an allowable alternative to elevating the lowest floor
to the base flood elevation in Zones V1-V30, VE and V.
G. Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. The following
standards, in addition to the standards in § 100-5A, General
construction standards, and § 100-5B, Standards for all structures,
apply, as indicated, in areas of special flood hazard to manufactured
homes and to recreational vehicles which are located in areas of special
flood hazard:
(1) Recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-A30, AE, AH,
V1-V30, V, and VE shall either: be on site fewer than 180
consecutive days; be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
meet the requirements for manufactured homes in § 100-5E(2), (3)
and (4). A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quickdisconnect-
type utilities and security devices and has no
permanently attached additions.
(2) A manufactured home that is placed or substantially improved in
Zones A1-A30, AE, AH, V1-V30, V, and VE shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the lowest floor is elevated to or
above the base flood elevation and is securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse
and lateral movement. Elevation on piers consisting of dry stacked
blocks is prohibited.
(3) Within Zone A or V, when no base flood elevation data are available,
new and substantially improved manufactured homes shall be
elevated such that the manufactured home chassis is supported by
reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent
strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and
are securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Elevation
on piers consisting of dry stacked blocks is prohibited.
(4) Within Zone AO, the floor shall be elevated above the highest
adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified on
the Flood Insurance Rate Map enumerated in § 100-3B (at least two
feet if no depth number is specified). Elevation on piers consisting
of dry stacked blocks is prohibited.
A. Appeals board.
§ 100-5 FIREARMS § 100-6

(1) The Board of Appeals as established by the City of Rye shall hear
and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
(2) The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the local administrator in the enforcement
or administration of this chapter.
(3) Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Appeals may
appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78
of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.
(4) In passing upon such applications, the Board of Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(a) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(b) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner;
(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
(e) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(f) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program of that area;
(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(j) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated
with conducting search and rescue operations during periods
of flooding;
(k) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave
action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
§ 100-6 RYE CODE § 100-6
95:338
(l) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations,
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems and streets and
bridges.
(5) Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D and the purposes
of this chapter, the Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
(6) The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions, including technical information, and report any variances
to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided items in
§ 100-6A(4) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(a) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
(b) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
(3) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for
the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(a) The criteria of Subsection B(1), (4), (5) and (6) of this section
are met;
(b) The structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create
no additional threat to public safety.
(4) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.

GRAFFITI
§ 104-1. Intent.
It has become apparent that the use of pens, writing and artistic devices
and spray can and marking devices used in connection with the writing of
graffiti on walls and other places of buildings and property has reached
such significant levels and proportions that immediate local attention
should be given this matter by this municipality. The defacing of such
property and the use of foul language in many of the writings is harmful
to the general public and violative of the good and welfare of the citizens,
residents and people of the City of Rye. It is the further intent of this
legislation that any person guilty of writing graffiti on buildings and
property shall be punished so that the punishment shall fit the offense.
§ 104-2. Prohibited acts.
No person shall write, paint or draw any inscription, figure or mark of
any type on any building, public or private, or any other property, real or
personal, owned, operated or maintained by any public benefit corporation,
the City of Rye or by any person, firm or corporation, or any agency
or instrumentality thereof, without the express written permission of the
owner of the property or his agent.
(6) Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification
of:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
(7) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from lowest floor elevation.

Under the authority of § 91 of the General Municipal Law of the State of
New York, any person who shall provide information which leads to the
detection, arrest and conviction of any other person of a violation of this
chapter shall be entitled to a reward equal to 1/2 of any fine imposed by the
court, but in no event greater than $1,000.
§ 104-5. Responsibilities of owner.
It is the responsibility of the owner, or his agent, of the building or structure
which has been defaced without the owner's, or his agent's, prior written
permission by a writing, painting or drawing of any inscription, figure or
mark to completely remove said graffiti from the building or structure
within 10 days of receipt of written notice of the defacement by the Police
Commissioner or his designee, said notice having been served personally or
as otherwise permitted by law.
§ 104-6. Failure of owner to comply. [Amended 8-14-2002 by L.L.
No. 4-2002]
Failure of the owner of the building or structure to remove the graffiti
within the time allowed after written notice may subject the owner to civil
proceedings or criminal prosecution as authorized by Chapter 108, Article
VIII, of the Code.
§ 104-7. Sale prohibited. [Added 7-15-1992 by L.L. No. 12-1992]

consultations with the Landmarks Advisory Committee, the Board
shall determine whether the proposed material change will be
appropriate to the preservation of the district of the Protected Sites
or Structures in view of the purposes of this chapter. In passing
upon appropriateness, the Board shall consider, in addition to any
other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural style,
general design arrangement, texture, material and color of the
building component involved and the relationship thereof to other
structures in the immediate neighborhood or district. With respect
to demolition in whole or in part, the Board shall also consider the
following:
(a) Whether the building is of such architectural or historical
interest that its removal would be to the detriment of the
public interest.
(b) Whether the building is of such interest that it could be made
into an historic shrine.
(c) Whether the building is of such old and unusual or uncommon
design, texture and materials that it could not be reproduced
or be reproduced only with great difficulty.
§ 117-5 JUNK DEALERS § 117-6
113:393
(d) Whether retention of the building would help preserve and
protect an historic place or area of historic interest in the City.
(e) Whether retention will promote the general welfare by
maintaining and increasing real estate values and encourage
interest in American history and architecture.
(2) If the Board approves a material change proposed, the Board shall
issue a certificate of appropriateness, which shall specify the work
to be done. In issuing such certificate, the Board may prescribe any
conditions that it deems to be necessary to carry out the intent and
purposes of this chapter. In setting such conditions, the Board is
authorized to require compliance with the Secretary of the
Interior's standards for additions, alterations and new construction
as contained in the Secretary of the Interior Standards for
Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings,
as revised from time to time. As to locally landmarked properties
which are not listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
proposed for such listing by the New York State Board on Historic
Preservation, this authorization does not include Secretary of the
Interior Standard 3 or 10, and the application of Standard 9 may
only be applied as locally amended. A copy of such standards,
including Standard 9 as locally amended, shall be kept on file and
made available to the public in the office of the Secretary of the
Board. A certificate issued pursuant to this section shall relate
solely to proposed plans accompanying the application or
otherwise submitted to the Board for official consideration prior to
the issuance of said certificate. It shall be unlawful to deviate from
the plans, including any modifications required as a condition of
the issuance of such certificate, unless and until an amended
certificate shall be applied for and issued. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Board shall not issue any such certificate unless and
until it has been advised by the agencies or department having
jurisdiction that there is no impediment to the issuance of any
building or other permit as may be required by applicable state or
local law or regulation for said work. [Amended 5-16-1990 by
L.L. No. 11-1990]
(3) If the Board determines that a certificate should not be issued or
that a certificate should be issued only upon specific conditions, the
Board shall notify the applicant in writing of such determination
and of the Board's reasons therefor. Such notice shall advise the
applicant of his right to a hearing before the Board to appeal such
determination or to show substantial hardship, pursuant to § 117-7
herein, as a result of such determination, if the applicant makes
written application to the Board therefor within 10 days of receipt
of such notice.

within such additional time period as the Board and the applicant
may agree, such application shall be deemed approved.
D. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as authorizing the

of population, the locations of trades and industries or location of
buildings designed for specific uses.
E. The Board may, in exercising or performing its powers, duties or
functions under this chapter with respect to any structure in a district
or to any Protected Structure, apply or impose, with respect to the

[Amended 12-7-1983 by L.L. No. 13-1983]
F. Removing dangerous conditions. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, in any case where a duly authorized enforcement
agency shall order or direct the construction, removal, alteration or
demolition of any improvement on a Protected Site or in a Preservation
District for the purpose of remedying conditions determined to be
dangerous to life, health or safety, a certificate of appropriateness shall
be issued to permit compliance with such order or direction; provided,
however, that the work not result in a material change of appearance
where the danger to life, health or safety may be abated without such
material change of appearance.
G. Any certificate of appropriateness and any permit to raze a building
issued pursuant to these rules and regulations shall expire of its own
limitation 12 months from the date of issuance if the work authorized
thereby is not commenced by the end of such twelve-month period; and
further, any such certificate and permit shall also expire and become
null and void if such authorized work is suspended and abandoned for a
period of 12 months after being commenced. Any period or periods of
time during which the right to use any such certificate or permit is
stayed pursuant to these rules and regulations or to any statutory or
judicial rule or order shall be excluded from the computation of the 12
months. [Added 12-7-1983 by L.L. No. 13-1983]
A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Board's failure to
issue a certificate of appropriateness causes a substantial hardship to
the applicant, the Board shall take one or more of the actions
enumerated in Subsection B below. For purposes of this section,
substantial hardship shall require a showing, to the satisfaction of the
Board, that:
§ 117-6 JUNK DEALERS § 117-7
113:395
(1) The land or improvement in question cannot yield a reasonable
return or be used for a necessary purpose of the owner if the
proposed construction, removal, alteration or demolition is not
permitted; and
(2) The hardship is not the result of any act or omission by the
applicant.
B. Upon a showing of substantial hardship, the Board shall take one or
more of the following actions: [Amended 12-7-1983 by L.L. No.
13-1983]
(1) Exercise its powers hereunder and its good offices to assist the
owner in developing an economically feasible plan to overcome the
Board's objections to the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness.
(2) Reconsider its decision and issue such certificate if it finds that
such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment to the
public welfare and without deviation from the intent and purposes
of this chapter.
(3) Recommend to the Council a limitation or remission of taxes on the
property affected, if permissible by law.
(4) Recommend to the Council that the City acquire, by purchase or
condemnation, a preservation restriction on the structure affected,
on such terms and conditions as the Council may approve.
(5) In the case of demolition in whole or in part, the Board shall
consider the issuance of a delayed certificate pursuant to § 117-7D.
C. Failure of Council to act.
(1) In the event that the Board determines that failure to issue a
certificate will cause a substantial hardship to the owner and
recommends that the Council take one or more steps to alleviate
such hardship and the Council fails to adopt such measures
recommended by the Board or such other measures as may be
sufficient to alleviate such hardship within 90 days, then such
certificate shall be deemed to have been issued to the owner, unless
a delayed certificate has also been issued by the Board pursuant to
§ 117-7D. [Amended 12-7-1983 by L.L. No. 13-1983]
(2) For the purposes of this section, the ninety-day period shall be
computed from the date the written findings and recommendations
of the Board are delivered to the City Clerk. Any relief granted
hereunder shall be in conformance with the objectives of this
chapter and shall be limited to the minimum required to effect
substantial justice and shall be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this chapter.

(1) With respect to an application to raze a landmark or a structure
located in an historic district, the Board of Architectural Review
shall have the right to issue a delayed certificate of
appropriateness. Such certificate shall not permit demolition or
razing for a period of up to 10 months from the date of application
therefor, during which time the Board and the applicant shall
undertake serious and continuing discussion for the purpose of
finding a method to save such property.
(2) During such period, the applicant and the Board shall cooperate in
attempting to avoid demolition of the property. At the end of this
ten-month period, if no mutually agreeable method of saving the
subject property being a reasonable prospect of eventual success is
underway or if no formal application for funds from any
governmental unit or nonprofit organization to preserve the subject
property is pending, the Building Inspector may issue the permit to
demolish the property without the approval of the Board. If such
mutually agreeable method for saving the subject property is not
successful or no such funds to preserve the subject property have
been obtained and are available for disbursement within a period of
two months following the end of such ten-month period, the
Building Inspector may issue the permit to demolish the property
without the approval of the Board.
(3) If the Board determines that a certificate of appropriateness should
not be issued, or that a delayed certificate or a certificate
contingent upon specific structural performance should be issued,
the Board shall notify the applicant in writing of such
determination, and of the Board's reasons therefor, and shall file
such notice with the City Clerk. Such notice shall advise the
applicant of his right to appeal such determination to the City
Council, which may reverse or affirm the action of the Board of
Architectural Review and of the Building Inspector.
(4) Unless the action of the Board of Architectural Review is reversed
by the City Council or by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
Building Inspector shall refuse to grant a building permit or sign a
demolition or other permit in an historic district or involving a
landmark where a certificate of appropriateness has been denied or
where the grant of such permit is not within the terms and
conditions of such certificates of appropriateness as have been
granted.

(1) Where it is alleged that a Protected Site or building or structure or
a building or structure in a Preservation District is not being
maintained in good repair, the Board of Architectural Review (by
majority vote), upon complaint of the Landmarks Advisory
Committee and after a hearing (with notice), shall determine what
improvements, betterments, replacements or repairs are required
to correct said deficiency.
(2) If upon written notice of the Board of Architectural Review's
decision the owner or other person in charge of the building or
structure does not commence corrective action and complete the
same within the time set forth by the Board of Architectural Review
in its decision, then the subsequent enforcement shall be the same
as if there had been noncompliance with a notice of violation issued
by the Building Inspector pursuant to § 108-49 et seq.
(3) Notice to an owner or other person in charge of the building or
structure shall be sufficiently given upon the date that a copy is

same to the City Comptroller, who shall proceed in the same manner as
relates to the collection of City taxes. The remaining installments, as
due, shall be extended in a separate column on the tax roll and shall be
payable and collected in each successive year thereafter under the

regulations as may be adopted by the Department of Public Works with
the approval of the City Manager, and the violation of any of such rules

be applicable to such violation, shall be just cause for cancellation and
termination by the City Manager, after a hearing, of the privilege of wasting

Works with the approval of the City Manager.

materials is a service benefiting the property, the cost of collection may
be levied against the property and may become a continuing lien. A
statement of fees and penalties in accordance with this section shall be
served upon the owner of the property, either personally or by mailing
addressed to the last known property owner as the name and address
appear on the assessment roll of the City of Rye. If the amount stated is

property, and this amount shall be levied, collected and enforced in the
same manner as taxes upon said property for city purposes are levied,
collected and enforced.

Where a public sewer is available and accessible in a street, alley, easement
or thoroughfare to a building or premises abutting thereon, the liquid

the public sewer unless otherwise prohibited, except that where a place of
residence is so located that a gravity connection from the plumbing above

residence is located more than 150 feet from the nearest public sewer, a
separate sewerage system may be maintained which otherwise complies
with city, county or state health laws, codes or regulations. Immediately
after the construction of a sewer connection every sewage tank, cesspool
or privy vault shall be emptied, cleaned, disinfected and filled with clean
mineral soil, rock or gravel. Where a public sanitary sewer is not accessible,
a building permit shall not be issued without submission of a copy of
the written approval of the Westchester County Commissioner of Health,
indicating that the premises may be adequately sewered by a separate
sewage disposal system. The further approval of the Common Council of
the City of Rye is required for such separate disposal systems. In addition
thereto there shall be an annual inspection of all private sewage disposal
systems by a contractor duly approved by the Westchester County
Commissioner of Health on all properties bordering on all watercourses,
including Long Island Sound, Milton Harbor and all tributaries thereto,
and wherever else directed by the Sanitation Committee of the Common
Council. A written certificate of such inspection shall be submitted to said
Committee for such action thereon as it may direct.
§ 161-2. Duty of owner. [Added 12-17-1980 by Ord. No. 6-198034]
Where an owner of any building is required to discharge sewage or other
liquid wastes from any plumbing system into a public sewer as required
by § 161-1 of this Code, he shall maintain such plumbing system within the
building and from the building to the point of connection with the public
sewer main, so as not to expose or discharge the sewage contents or other
deleterious liquid or matter therefrom to the atmosphere, except through
legally permissible vents, or on the surface of the ground, public or private,
or into any storm sewer or drain or into any watercourse or body of water.

conditions and remove the violations so as to comply with the provisions
of this article within 10 days after service of such notice, then in that
event, the city may cause the plumbing system to be repaired or
replaced so as to comply with the provisions of this article, and the cost
or expense of doing said work, plus an administrative charge of $100,
shall be ascertained, and a report thereof shall be forthwith filed with

be paid by the owner to the city within 30 days after demand. The
owner shall have the right to a hearing before the City Manager with
respect to the total cost of the work as set forth in said report within 10

§ 161-5. Imposition of sewer rent.
§ 161-6. Definitions.
For the purpose of this article, the definitions set forth herein shall be
controlling:
SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM  The system for the collection of sewage,
including all sewer mains, pumping stations, appurtenances or other
facilities, which are owned, operated and maintained by the City of Rye,
whether in or outside the City.
SEWER RENTS  A schedule of annual charges established and imposed
by the City of Rye for the use of the sanitary sewer system.
SYSTEM USERS  The record owners of real properties that have sanitary
facilities which discharge into the sanitary sewer system, whether the
properties are located in or outside of the City of Rye.
TOTAL WATER CONSUMPTION  The total volume of water delivered to
a property by the water source for which a sewer user is responsible. The
total volume of water shall be the sum of the volume of water metered by,
or otherwise calculated by, the water source
WATER CONSUMPTION  The consumption of water, measured in
hundreds of cubic feet (CCF); one CCF equals 748 gallons.
WATER SOURCE  Any entity that delivers water to a property such as
united water westchester or its successors in interest or assigns.
A. Pursuant to Article 14-F of the General Municipal Law, there is hereby
established and imposed a plan of sewer rents applicable to the City of
Rye's sanitary sewer system. Such plan shall consist of annual charges
against properties that utilize the City's sewers. The annual sewer rents
as provided for in this chapter shall be applied to pay the costs of the
operation, maintenance, upkeep, repair and replacement of the
sanitary sewer system. The purpose of this article is to preclude the
cost of the sanitary sewer system from being funded solely from the
property tax and to more equitably distribute such cost on all
properties, including tax exempt properties.
B. In addition to any charges provided by law, the owner of any real
property within the City of Rye served by a sewer system maintained by
a municipality other than the City of Rye shall pay to the City of Rye a
sewer rent for the use of such sewer system. Such sewer rent shall be at
the rate of $210 per connection thereto or shall be such pro rata
amount allocable to such property as the City of Rye shall be required to
pay for the use of such sewer system.
§ 161-5 RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES § 161-7
153:481
§ 161-7. Collection of sewer rent; lien.
All sewer rents imposed hereunder shall be levied, connected and enforced
in the same manner and at the same time as provided for the collection
and enforcement of City taxes. If such sewer rents are not paid when due,
it shall be the duty of the City Comptroller to charge and collect interest
thereon at the same rates specified for the collection of City taxes. Such
sewer rents shall constitute a lien upon the real property served by such
sewer system, and such lien shall be prior and superior to every other
lien or claim except the lien of an existing tax, assessment or other lawful
charge.
§ 161-8. Sewer rent; adjustments; changes.
§ 161-9. Annual costs of the sanitary sewer system.
The annual operation and maintenance costs of the sanitary sewer system
shall be determined as part of the City' budget process. The annual costs
shall include, but not be limited to:

water consumption as determined by the water source using a water
meter or other measuring device, or an estimated amount if the water
source is unable to obtain a reading.
B. Adjustment. System users may apply to the City Manager for an
adjustment of the amount of water consumption. Such application shall
in writing, accompanied by any prescribed filing fee, and include all
evidence to support the degree and amount of water usage that is
claimed to be applied for uses that do not result in discharges into the
sanitary sewer system. The Manager may grant an adjustment on an
appeal as provided hereinafter, but in no event shall such adjustment
exceed 10% of the water consumption.
C. Changes. The initial rate of the sewer rent shall be established by
resolution of the City Council after public hearing on five days' notice.
Subsequent changes to the rate of the sewer rent and amount of
penalty shall be made in the same manner.
A. Personnel services, including salaries and fringe benefits.
B. Contractual services.

authority has been designated on a frequency established by the City.
B. Sewer rents shall be paid to the City of Rye.
C. Sewer rent bills shall be sent to system users to the address to which
real estate bills would be sent.
(1) The failure of a system owner to receive a bill shall not excuse
nonpayment thereof, nor shall it act as a waiver of a penalty
imposed herein prescribed.
(2) A system user that intends to convey property shall notify the City
or entity to which billing authority has been delegated sufficiently
in advance of the closing title for a final reading and new ownership
information.
D. System users may be afforded the option of receiving e-bills or direct
deposit of payments. System users may request that a tenant receive
bills, and such additional notice may be given as an accommodation.

A. The City Engineer may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual
or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of
persons, or to the MS4. The City Engineer shall notify the person of
such suspension within a reasonable time thereafter, in writing, of the
reasons for the suspension. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the City Engineer may take
such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the
MS4 or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge or unauthorized
connection. Any person discharging to the City's MS4 in violation of this
chapter may have his/her MS4 access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge or result in the remedy of an
unauthorized connection. The City Engineer will notify a violator in
writing of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons
therefor. The violator may petition the City Engineer for a
reconsideration and hearing. Access may be granted by the City
Engineer if he/she finds that the illicit discharge has ceased and the
discharger has taken steps to prevent its recurrence or that the
discharger has obtained proper permission for the connection. Access

§ 162-12. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES

permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the City Engineer prior to the allowing of discharges to the
MS4.
§ 162-13. Connection permits.
may be denied if the City Engineer determines in writing that the
illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur or the unauthorized
connection has not been remedied. A person commits an offense if the
person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this
section without the prior approval of the City Engineer.
A. General. Any connection to the City's MS4 requires a permit issued by
the City Engineer. Applications for permits shall be made on forms
provided by the office of the City Engineer. Permit applications shall be
supplemented by any plans, specifications, analyses, calculations or
other information considered pertinent by the City Engineer. The City
considers connection to its MS4 as a last resort to solve flooding
problems. Before approving a connection, the City will require that
applicants use on-site best management practices to handle stormwater
and other authorized nonstormwater discharges to the maximum extent
practicable. The office of the City Engineer will assess the adequacy of
the applicant's on-site stormwater disposal management practices.
B. Permit types.

discharge of stormwater or authorized nonstormwater, per
§ 162-6A of this chapter, from properties occupied by private
dwellings.

discharge authorized under § 162-13 of this chapter, as well as for a
discharge permitted under a SPDES permit, waiver, or waste
discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under
the authority of the NYSDEC. This permit is subject to special
terms and conditions by the City Engineer. The permit will expire
on or before the expiration of the NYSDEC SPDES permit, waiver
or order or upon change of ownership or use of the property.
(3) Special permit. An authorization for the connection as well as the
discharge of stormwater or authorized nonstormwater, per
§ 162-6A of this chapter, from all properties occupied by other than

E. Indemnification. The property owner shall indemnify and save the City
harmless from any loss, damage or expense, claims or suits arising out
of and in connection with the installation and connection to the City's
MS4. In addition, the City makes no guarantee that its MS4 will not
become surcharged or otherwise overburdened and that water from the
MS4 will not back up through the connection onto the owner's property.
By making a connection, the applicant/owner assumes all of the risk
and liability that may arise from it.
F. Permit transfers. General permits may be transferred with the sale of a
residential property, provided the use does not change. The new
property owner shall comply with the terms and conditions of the
transferred permit. Special permits are not transferable without
approval of the City Engineer.
G. Work within City roads. Any connection made within or involving work
within a City road will also comply and be subject to any and all
applicable codes and regulations pertaining to permits for work on and
within City streets and roads. A permit under this chapter does not
relieve the applicant from the permits under the foregoing codes and
regulations.
H. Other permits required. A connection permit issued pursuant to this
chapter does not relieve the applicant from any and all other permits,
permissions, or compliance with rules and regulations that may be
required by federal, state, county, town, City government agencies or
other public or private parties. This permit does not supersede any of
the above.
I. Permit rules and regulations. The City Engineer may promulgate rules
and regulations for the permitting process within the constraints of this
chapter.
§ 162-13 RYE CODE § 162-14
162:496
§ 162-14. Access and monitoring of discharges.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the City Engineer
must inspect to enforce any provision of this chapter, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,
or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition that
constitutes a violation of this chapter.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities public
and private subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may
be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a
discharger has security measures in force that require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records as may be required to implement this
chapter.
(3) The City shall have the right to set up on any facility subject to this
chapter such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the City
Engineer to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
stormwater discharge.
(4) The City Engineer has the right to require the facilities subject to
this chapter to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at
its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the City access to a facility subject
to this chapter are a violation of this chapter. A person who is the
operator of a facility subject to this chapter commits an offense if
the person denies the City reasonable access to the facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this
chapter.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 162-14 STORM SEWER SYSTEM § 162-15
162:497
§ 162-15. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the City Engineer in person or by
telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and
mailed to the City Engineer within three business days of the telephone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial
or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment
shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions
taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least
three years.
§ 162-16. Enforcement.
A. Notice of violation. When the City Engineer finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter or
a permit issued pursuant to this chapter, he/she may order compliance
by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice
may require without limitation any or all of the actions listed below:
(1) The elimination of illicit or unauthorized connections or discharges;
(2) That violating discharges, practices, operations, activities, or
connections shall cease and desist;
(3) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
(4) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(5) Payment of a fine; and
(6) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. If
abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
§ 162-15 RYE CODE § 162-16
162:498
§ 162-17. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal within 15 calendar
days of its issuance. The City Engineer shall hear the appeal within 30 days
after the filing of the appeal, and within five days of making his/her decision,
issue a decision by certified mail to the discharger. The City Engineer may
conduct the hearing and take evidence or may designate any officer or
employee of the Office of the City Engineer to do so.
§ 162-18. Corrective measures after appeal.
§ 162-19. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this chapter. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the City Engineer may
petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person
B. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this chapter
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000
or imprisonment for a period not to exceed two months, or both, for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a
fine not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,000 or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed two months, or both; and upon conviction for a
third or subsequent offense all of which were committed within a period
of five years, punishable by a fine not less than $2,000 nor more than
$5,000 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed two months, or both.
However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and
judicial officers generally, violations of this chapter shall be deemed
misdemeanors and for such purpose only all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, or in the event of an appeal, within five
business days of the decision of the City Engineer, then the City
Engineer shall request the owner's permission for access to the subject
private property to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to
abate the violation and/or restore the property.
B. If refused access to the subject private property, the City Engineer may
seek a warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to
enter upon the property to determine whether a violation has occurred.
Upon determination that a violation has occurred, the City Engineer
may seek a court order to take any and all measures reasonably
necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. The cost of
implementing and maintaining such measures shall be the sole
responsibility of the discharger.

from activities which would create further violations or compelling the
person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.

§ 162-21. Violations deemed a public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions
of this chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is
declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored
at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise
compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
§ 162-22. Remedies not exclusive.
The remedies listed in this chapter and regulations are not exclusive of any
other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law
and it is within the discretion of the authorized enforcement agency to seek
cumulative remedies.

default shall be collected and enforced in the same manner, by the same
proceedings, at the same time and under the same penalties, in addition

supervision and control of the City Comptroller, into which the proceeds
of any financing and the assessments collected shall be paid for any
improvement financed through such fund as hereinafter provided. The City
Council may determine, by resolution, that the financing of the construction
of any improvement heretofore or hereafter authorized, including the
acquisition of any land or any right in the land therefor, which shall be
paid completely by assessments upon the property benefited or partially by
assessments upon the City, shall be through the aforesaid special fund. The
City Council, upon the completion of any such improvement or at any time

make a final determination at the conclusion of the hearing or as soon
thereafter as is practicable. In the event that a distributor is successful
in reversing a determination that the claimed violation was of a nature
which warranted removal pending a final determination, no fee shall be
imposed for the removal and storage of the newsrack which was the
subject of the appeal, and failure to comply with such determination
shall not serve as a basis for prosecution under Subsection D of this
section. The distributor may bring an Article 78 proceeding to review
the decision of the City Manager.
F. Nothing contained in this article shall be interpreted to limit or impair
the exercise by the City of Rye of its police power in the event of an
emergency to remove any newsrack which presents a clear and present
danger of imminent personal injury or property damage to users of the
public streets of this City.

Engineer may authorize such modifications upon written request of
the subdivider, provided that such modifications are within the

proposed improvements will result in the removal of or damage to
any tree identified for preservation on the tree preservation plan.
When the City Planner determines that the proposed improvements
will require the removal of a tree designated for preservation or
will result in damage to the tree by way of grading, removal of root
systems or alteration of the surface water runoff, he shall advise
the applicant of his findings and request that the applicant revise
his layout so as to avoid these conditions or to seek a modification
of the subdivision approval from the Planning Commission. All
plans submitted for review by the City Planner shall include an
accurate topographic site plan, indicating existing and proposed
contours, supplemented with critical spot elevations; plans for all
proposed buildings, which shall include finished floor elevations; all
trees located on the lot, which are designated for preservation or
required to be installed under the subdivision tree preservation
plan; driveways, entrance walks, exterior stairs and walls; and
other proposed site improvements. No building permit or surface
water control permit shall be issued until the City Planner has
advised the issuing officers, in writing, that the proposed
§ 170-8 RYE CODE § 170-8
165:578
improvements are consistent with the subdivision tree preservation
plan. [Added 4-7-1976]
B. Inspection of improvements.
(1) Prior to the start of construction of any required improvements, the
subdivider shall furnish to the City Engineer a copy of the
specifications included in any contract entered into by the
subdivider for such construction.
(2) The construction of all required improvements shall be supervised
by a registered professional engineer employed by the subdivider,
who, after completion of construction, shall certify to the
Commission that all required improvements have been constructed
as required and approved by the Commission or as such
requirements have been modified by the City Engineer under
Subsection A(4) above, and shall furnish to the City Engineer a
certified plan showing all improvements as constructed in the same
detail as required for the approved construction plan by § 170-21C.
(3) The City Engineer or other designated official shall inspect
required improvements during the construction to assure their
satisfactory completion, and the Planning Commission shall require
a certificate from such official stating that all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed. The City Planner
shall inspect the subdivision for compliance with the conditions of
approval. The subdivider shall pay to the city an inspection fee, to
be set by the City Council annually by resolution before adoption of
the budget, and the subdivision plat shall not be signed by the
Chairman and the Secretary of the Planning Commission until such
fee has been paid. In order to facilitate inspection, the subdivider's
engineer shall set stakes not more than 50 feet apart outside of the
area to be disturbed by construction along all street utility and
drainage lines to be built, marked with proper center-line stations,
offset from the center line and cut or fill at center line. Where
several lines run parallel to each other, only one set of stakes shall
be required. [Amended 10-12-1976; 10-19-1988 by L.L. No.

(4) If the City Engineer finds, upon inspection, that any of the required
improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the
approved plans, the subdivider shall be responsible for completing
said improvements according to specifications. If the City Engineer
or other duly designated official does not carry out inspection of
required improvements during construction, the subdivider or the
bonding company shall not in any way be relieved of their
responsibilities.
§ 170-8 SIGNS § 170-8
165:579
C. Utilities. Where utilities required by the Planning Commission are to be
installed by a public utility company, the Planning Commission, in its
discretion, may accept assurance from the public utility company, in
writing, that such installations will be furnished by the company within
a specified period of time and in accordance with the approved
construction plans.
D. Future status of streets, parks and easements.
(1) The subdivider may add as part of the plat a notation, if he so
desires, to the effect that no offer of dedication of certain or all of
the streets and parks shown on the plat is made to the public.
Formal offer of cession to the public of all streets and parks not
marked with such notation on the plat shall be filed with the
Planning Commission prior to approval of the plat by the Planning
Commission. Acceptance of any such offer shall rest with the
Common Council. In the event that the subdivider shall elect not to
file the plat in the office of the County Clerk within the ninety-day
period required by law, then such formal offer of cession shall be
deemed to be void.
(2) There shall be submitted to the Planning Commission prior to the
approval of the plat:
(a) Copies of agreements or other documents providing for the
suitable maintenance of all streets and parks not offered to the
public and setting forth the standards and conditions of
maintenance.
(b) Statements of all rights which exist with respect to the use of
such property.
(c) Agreements permitting entrance by the City of Rye and/or
responsible public utility on streets, parks or easements for the
purpose of installing or repairing required improvements in
the event of nonperformance under the terms of the bond.
(d) Agreements permitting entrance by the City of Rye and/or the
responsible public utility on streets, parks or easements for the
purpose of repairing or replacing utility and drainage lines.
These agreements or reference to them shall be noted on the
plat.
(3) The approval by the Planning Commission of a subdivision plat
shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the
Common Council of any street, park, playground or other open
space shown on said plat. The Planning Commission may require
said plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. The
Planning Commission may also require the filing of a written
agreement by the subdivider, satisfactory to the Common Council,
covering future title, dedication and provision for the cost of
§ 170-8 RYE CODE § 170-8
165:580
§ 170-9. Filing of approved subdivision plat. [Amended 2-19-1964]
Upon the completion of all requirements set forth in these regulations or
in the action approving the subdivision plat, the plat shall be signed by the
appropriate officers of the Planning Commission and shall be filed by the
subdivider in the office of the County Clerk. Any subdivision plat not so filed
within 90 days after approval by the Planning Commission shall become null
and void, as provided in Article 3, § 32, of the General City Law.
§ 170-10. Improvements required before occupancy of buildings.
Where a permit is desired for occupancy of a building in a subdivision
prior to the completion of the improvements as required in the Planning
Commission's approval of the subdivision plat, the provisions of Section
9-8.2(c) (iv) of the Zoning Ordinance44 shall be complied with to assure that
the traveled way serving the proposed building is adequate for vehicular
access by the occupant and by police and fire equipment prior to the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy and that, where such certificate
has been issued, the street will be maintained in suitable condition. The
subdivider shall maintain the traveled ways or streets within the subdivision
under the above-described circumstances and, in addition, those public
or private streets abutting or adjacent to the subdivision wherein the
subdivider has or will have done any construction work in connection
with the subdivision. The subdivider's responsibility to maintain streets in
condition suitable for all-weather traffic shall also extend to those streets on
which no new construction was done but which were damaged by unusually
heavy traffic due to the development of the subdivision. Should he fail to do
so, the City of Rye may undertake necessary maintenance and, in such case,
shall be reimbursed out of part of the performance bond required under
§ 170-8A(1) and (2).

ARTICLE IV
General Requirements for Subdivision of Land
§ 170-12. Requirements used as standards and guides.
The Planning Commission, in considering an application for the subdivision
of land, shall be guided by the following considerations and standards.
§ 170-13. General.
§ 170-14. Streets.
A. Character of land. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that
it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or
peril from fire, flood or other menace.
B. Conformity to Official Map and City Development Plan. Subdivisions
shall conform to the streets shown on the Official Map of the city and
shall be properly related to the City Development Plan as it is developed
and adopted by the Planning Commission.
C. Access from suitably improved street. The area to be subdivided shall
have frontage on and access from a street on the Official Map, which
street is suitably improved to the satisfaction of the Commission so as to
accommodate the traffic generated by the subdivision without
impairing its present function or for which street a bond covering such
improvement is held by the city.
D. Minimizing flood damage. Subdivisions located in areas of special flood
hazard shall be designed to minimize flood damage, shall have all
utilities and facilities located and constructed to minimize or eliminate
flood damage and shall have surface water control improvements and
other drainage improvements adequate to reduce exposure to flood
hazards. [Added 3-5-1980 by L.L. No. 3-1980]
A. Location, width and improvement of streets. Streets shall be suitably
located, of sufficient width and adequately improved to accommodate
the prospective traffic and to afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting,
snow removal or other road maintenance equipment, and shall
be coordinated so as to compose a convenient system. Where a street
connection is necessary for the appropriate development of adjoining
land, the arrangement of streets shall include such provision.
B. Widths of right-of-way. Streets shall have the right-of-way prescribed in
the schedule in Subsection C(1) below unless otherwise indicated on
the City Development Plan.
C. Standards for street design.
(1) Streets shall meet the following design standards. Street
classification may be indicated on the City Development Plan or
Official Map. Otherwise, it shall be determined by the Planning
§ 170-12 SIGNS § 170-14
165:585
Commission. Standards are not shown for major streets, which
would be built by the state or county.

(3) For local residential streets in R Districts, the Planning Commission
may authorize a reduction of the minimum width of pavement to 24
feet for permanent dead-end streets not longer than six times the
minimum lot width for the zoning district, and for all or part of the
length of other streets in R-2 and R-3 Districts where
considerations of grade, sight distance and probable traffic volume
and speed indicate that such lesser width would be consistent with
requirements of safety and convenience.
D. Relations to topography. Streets shall be related appropriately to the
topography, and all streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as
possible of the building sites at or above the grades of the streets.
Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the original
topography. A combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided.
E. Block size. Block dimensions shall be generally twice the normal lot
depth and not more than 12 times the minimum lot width required in
the zoning district. In long blocks, the Planning Commission may
require the reservation of a twenty-foot-wide easement through the
block to accommodate utilities or pedestrian traffic. (See § 170-17B and
C)
F. Intersections. Intersections of major streets by other streets shall be at
least 800 feet apart, if possible. Cross street (four-cornered)
intersections shall be avoided in general, except as shown on the City
Development Plan or at other important traffic intersections. A distance
of at least 150 feet shall be maintained between center lines of offset
intersecting streets. Within 100 feet of an intersection, streets shall be
at approximately right angles. Grades shall be limited to no more than
3% within 50 feet of an intersection. All street intersection corners shall
be rounded by curves of at least 25 feet in radius at the property line. In
order to provide visibility for traffic safety, that portion of any corner lot
(whether at an intersection entirely within the subdivision or of a new
street with an existing street) which is shown shaded on Sketch A shall
be cleared of all growth (except isolated trees) and obstructions above
the level three feet higher than the center line of the street. If directed,
ground shall be excavated to achieve visibility.
§ 170-14 SIGNS § 170-14
165:587
G. Continuation of streets into adjacent property. The arrangement of
streets shall provide for the continuation of principal streets between
adjacent properties where such continuation is necessary, among other
things, for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection or
efficient provision of utilities and drainage, and in places where such
continuation is shown on the City Development Plan. If the adjacent
property is underdeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street
temporarily, the right-of-way shall be extended to the property line. A
temporary circular turnaround with a traveled way having a minimum
of 40 feet in radius at the outside pavement edge and a fifty-foot
easement radius shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets,
with the notation on the plat that land outside the normal street rightof-
way shall revert to abutters whenever the street is continued. A
temporary turnaround shall not be required within 200 feet of an
intersection where an alternate arrangement has been approved by the
Planning Commission.
H. Permanent dead-end streets. Where a street does not extend to the
boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not needed for
access to or from adjoining property, its terminus shall not be nearer to
such boundary than the normal average lot depth for the zoning district
in which the land is located, However, the Planning Commission may
require the reservation of an easement to accommodate traffic or
utilities. A circular turnaround of a minimum right-of-way radius of 50
feet and a minimum radius of 40 feet to the outside edge of the
pavement shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street.
For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire
protection, permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited in
length to not more than six times the minimum lot width for the zoning
district.
I. Widening or realignment of existing streets. Where the subdivision
borders an existing street and additional land is required for
§ 170-14 RYE CODE § 170-14
165:588
§ 170-15. Improvements. [Amended 6-15-1965]
realignment or widening of such street, as indicated by the Official
Map or City Development Plan or otherwise determined by the Planning
Commission to be necessary, such additional land shall either be
included as a part of such street as indicated on such plat or be marked
on the plat "Reserved for Street Realignment (or Widening) Purposes."
J. Street names.
(1) All streets shall be named, and such names shall be subject to the
approval of the Planning Commission. Names shall be sufficiently
different in sound and in spelling from other street names in the
city so as not to cause confusion. A street which is a continuation of
an existing street shall bear the same name. Street names shall
conform to the following classifications:
Street Name Type of Street
Avenue or Road Major or secondary street
Street or Lane Local residential street (except as follows)
Court or Place Dead-end street
Circle Street, both ends of which intersect the
same street at different locations
(2) Numbers as street names are not acceptable. House numbers will
be assigned by the City Engineer.
A. Street improvements.
(1) General. Streets shall be graded and improved with pavement,
street signs, sidewalks, streetlighting standards, curbs, gutters,
street trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm drains and fire
hydrants, except where waivers may be requested and the Planning
Commission may waive, subject to appropriate conditions, such
improvements as it considers are not requisite in the interest of the
public health, safety and general welfare. If placed on the street
right-of-way, underground utilities may be required by the Planning
Commission to be placed between the paved roadway and street
line, where possible, to simplify location and repair of the lines. The
subdivider shall install underground service connections to the
property line of each lot before the street is paved. Walks in
pedestrian easements shall be improved according to specifications
and as shown on the construction plans. Other easements shall be
cleared and graded where required by the City Engineer.
(2) Underground utility wires.
(a) Electric and telephone wires shall be installed underground,
except that the Planning Commission may waive this
requirement at the request of the applicant in cases where the
§ 170-14 SIGNS § 170-15
165:589
Commission shall determine that the installation of
underground service will result in practical difficulty or
hardship. In making such determination, the Commission shall
take into account the following:
[1] The size and nature of the subdivision.
[2] Unusual topographic or other natural conditions.
[3] Type of service existing in the area adjacent to the
subdivision at the time of application for waiver.
(b) The Planning Commission may grant a full or partial waiver of
this requirement, and in approving such waiver, may require
the installation of electric and telephone wires on poles or may
require a combination of underground and overhead service.
B. Surface water control improvements.
(1) The subdivider is required to preserve the natural drainage
features of the land, except for those reasonable alterations
permitted by the Planning Commission, and to provide surface
water control facilities as required by the Planning Commission to
protect adjoining property from surface water runoff.
(2) The subdivider may be required by the Planning Commission to
control any spring or surface water that may exist prior to or occur
as a result of the development of the property by installing or
constructing surface water control facilities, which hereinafter
shall be deemed to include pipes, ditches, culverts, water retention
areas and structures, swales, slopes and other conduits or
reservoirs of water. The developer may also be required by the
Planning Commission to provide temporary on-site surface water
and soil erosion control facilities during construction.
(3) Surface water control facilities, as may be required, shall be
located either in perpetually unobstructed easements or in a street
right-of-way when appropriate. The subdivider shall not construct
culverts, ditches, pipes or other conduits of water which will
discharge waters onto adjoining land in such a manner as to impair
the appropriate use and development of that land.
(4) The subdivider may be required by the Planning Commission to
offset the increase in the rate of surface water runoff resulting from
the proposed development in accordance with the following
requirements: [Amended 5-21-1986 by L.L. No. 7-1986]
(a) The surface water control plan and related subdivision plans
shall be referred to the Westchester County Soil and Water
Conservation District for their review and comments.
(b) Sites of four acres or more shall provide for a one-hundredyear
stormwater detention facility or facilities, designed using
§ 170-15 RYE CODE § 170-15
165:590
those methods contained in "Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds Technical Release No. 55," prepared by the United
States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service,
and as from time to time amended, supplemented or replaced.
In the Beaver Swamp Brook Watershed, the Planning
Commission may waive or modify this one-hundred-year
detention requirement after consultation with the Westchester
County Soil and Water Conservation District.
(c) Sites with a proposed 75% or more net increase in impervious
surfaces shall provide for a one-hundred-year stormwater
detention storage facility or facilities designed using those
methods contained in "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds
Technical Release No. 55," prepared by the United States
Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service, and as
from time to time amended, supplemented or replaced. In the
Beaver Swamp Brook Watershed, the Planning Commission
may waive or modify this one-hundred-year detention
requirement after consultation with the Westchester County
Soil and Water Conservation District.
(d) Sites of less than four acres with a proposed increase of less
than a seventy-five-percent net increase in impervious surfaces
shall provide for a twenty-five-year stormwater detention
storage facility or facilities, except in the Beaver Swamp Brook
Watershed in which locations one-hundred-year stormwater
retention shall be required, designed using those methods
contained in "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds Technical
Release No. 55," prepared by the United States Department of
Agriculture Soil Conservation Service, and as from time to time
amended, supplemented or replaced, or another method
specified by the City Engineer after consultation with the
Westchester County Soil and Water Conservation District. The
Planning Commission may waive or modify this one-hundredyear
detention requirement after consultation with the
Westchester County Soil and Water Conservation District.
(e) Rainfall depth used in calculating required stormwater
detention facilities shall be, 7.2 inches in 24 hours for a onehundred-
year storm and 5.7 inches in 24 hours for a twentyfive-
year storm. In each case, a Type III distribution shall be
used.
(f) Detention facility maximum discharge rates for
preconstruction conditions for the one-hundred-year storm and
the twenty-five-year storm shall be as follows:
[1] One-hundred-year storm: one-hundred-, fifty-, twenty-five,
ten-, five- and two-year storms.

[2] Twenty-five-year storm: twenty-five-, ten- , five- and twoyear
storms.
(5) The Commission may reduce the permitted number of lots and
reduce the permitted coverage of the land if it is determined that
the surface water retention facilities considered appropriate by the
Commission will not have sufficient capacity to offset the increase
in the rate and quantity of surface water runoff resulting from the
proposed development and/or if it is determined that the increment
of the increase which cannot be retained on the site cannot be
carried away by natural drainage or by public surface water control
facilities.
(6) The Planning Commission and the City Engineer may waive or
reduce the requirements of § 170-15B(4) of this chapter if it is
determined by them that existing storm drains or storm drains
proposed to be constructed are of adequate size, and will discharge
surface water runoff directly to Long Island Sound, Milton Harbor
or Port Chester Harbor. [Amended 5-21-1986 by L.L. No.

(7) (Reserved)45
C. Monuments and lot corner markers. Permanent monuments of a size
and type approved by the City Engineer shall be set at such block
corners, angle points, points of curves in streets and other points as the
City Engineer may require, and their location shall be shown on the
subdivision plat. All lot corners shall be marked by iron rods or pipes
driven below the frost line.
D. Tree preservation. [Added 4-7-1976; amended 11-7-1990 by L.L.
No. 18-1990; 11-6-1996 by L.L. No. 9-1996]
(1) The subdivider is required to permanently tag or affix identification
on each tree on the site having a caliper of eight inches or more
prior to the submission of an application for preliminary
subdivision approval.
(2) The subdivider shall lay out the subdivision in such a manner as to
minimize the number of trees eight inches or more in caliper to be
removed to accommodate development.
(3) The subdivider is required to preserve all trees eight inches or
more in caliper unless the Planning Commission has specifically
authorized their removal.
(4) On sites devoid of trees eight inches or more in caliper or sparsely
populated with such trees, the Commission shall require the
installation of supplemental trees having a minimum caliper of six
45.Editor's Note: Former Subsection B(7), regarding waiver of report for minor subdivisions,
as amended, was repealed 5-21-1986 by L.L. No. 7-1986.

165:592
inches, such that there will be an overall density of one tree per
3,000 square feet of land, or fraction thereof. Supplemental trees
shall also be tagged for future identification.
(5) The subdivider may be required to preserve trees having a caliper
of less than eight inches if the Planning Commission finds that such
trees have significant aesthetic value due to species or location or
that their removal would excessively alter drainage or affect the
stability of slopes.
(6) The subdivider shall install protective barriers around each tree
not specifically authorized for removal prior to the start of any
construction or may, with the approval of the Commission, erect
protective barriers around sections in which several trees are
located. The barriers shall remain in place and be kept in good
repair until all construction has been completed and removal of the
barriers has been authorized by the City Engineer.
(7) Trees which have been designated for preservation, including
supplemental trees, shall be deemed to be required site
improvements, and their preservation and replacement, as
necessary, including the replacement of trees damaged during
construction, shall remain the responsibility of the subdivider for a
period of one year after the completion of the subdivision. That
portion of the performance bond calculated to be the cost of
replacing trees to be preserved or supplemental trees which may
be damaged during construction shall be retained by the city for at
least one year after all improvements in the subdivision have been
completed. Prior to release of the bond, the trees shall be inspected
to ensure that they have not been damaged and that future growth
will be characteristic of the species.
(8) The requirements for tree preservation shall not apply to lots for
existing houses in a new subdivision, provided that such lots and
houses will not be altered to accommodate development of the
subdivision. However, this provision shall not relieve the subdivider
of the responsibility of including in the tree preservation plan for
the subdivision any tree eight inches or more in caliper located
within 50 feet of a new lot or required subdivision improvement.
When lots for existing houses have been excluded from the tree
preservation plan, the landscape architect shall set forth on the
plan which lots have been excluded and shall certify that the plan
does include all trees eight inches or more in caliper located within
50 feet of a new lot or other subdivision improvement and that
surrounding development will not substantially alter the
environment of the trees on such lot.
(9) In cases where the number of trees required to satisfy the penalty
can not be accommodated on the site of the violation, the penalty
shall include planting of trees on available public spaces and/or
payment of $1,700 to the City Tree Fund. [Amended 12-16-1998

12-20-2000 by L.L. No. 16-2000]
(10) Modification of tree preservation plan requirements. If at any time
before or during the construction of required improvements or a
residence on a lot it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City
Planner that unforeseen conditions or the design of the actual
residence proposed to be constructed make it necessary or
preferable to modify the subdivision tree preservation plan, the
City Planner may authorize such modifications upon written
request of the subdivider with a supporting letter from the
landscape architect who prepared the original tree preservation
plan and receipt of a fee payable to the city. The City Council shall
set the fee annually by resolution before adoption of the budget.
This supporting letter shall include a revised tree preservation plan
for the lot or other area affected by the proposed modification
prepared by the subdivider's landscape architect, provided that
such modifications are within the spirit and intent of the Planning
Commission's approval. The City Planner may, at his discretion,
decide not to exercise his authority to modify a tree preservation
plan and may, instead, require the person requesting the
modification to apply to the Planning Commission for a
modification of the subdivision approval. The City Planner shall
issue any authorization under this subsection in writing and shall
transmit a copy of such authorization to the Planning Commission
at its next regular meeting, subject to the following limitations:
[Amended 12-17-1997 by L.L. No. 18-1997; 12-16-1998 by
L.L. No. 13-1998]
(a) The City Planner shall not authorize the removal of a tree
required to be preserved if the proposed improvements can be
relocated so as to avoid the need for the removal of the tree.
(b) The City Planner shall not authorize the removal of a tree
required to be preserved on the basis of the current condition
of the tree, even if recommended by the subdivider's landscape
architect, without first consulting with the City Tree Foreman.
(c) In the case of the modification of the location of required
replacement trees or other required landscaping, the City
Planner may not waive the requirement for the installation of
the plant materials, but may modify the location if field
conditions, such as underground rock, prevent the planting of
the material in the location shown on the approved tree
preservation plan, provided that the modified location and the
original location accomplish the same goals originally
envisioned by the Planning Commission.
(d) The City Planner shall not authorize a relocation of the house
and driveway shown on the approved tree preservation plan, if
it will result in the removal of a tree required to be preserved
§ 170-15 RYE CODE § 170-15
165:594
on the approved tree preservation plan, unless a tree of
greater or equal value originally shown on the approved tree
preservation plan for removal will be preserved as a result of
such relocation, and then only in consultation with the City
Tree Foreman as to the value of the respective trees.
E. Erosion and sediment control. [Added 5-21-1986 by L.L. No. 7-1986]
(1) The surface water control plan shall be referred to the Westchester
County Soil and Water Conservation District for their review and
comments for all new construction, exclusive of building additions
and accessory buildings, surfaces and structures for existing
buildings.
(2) Development shall preserve salient natural features, keep cut and
fill operations to a minimum and ensure conformity with
topography so as to create the least erosion potential, based upon
the Best Management Practices Manual.
(3) Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as soon as practicable and in any
event within the time period specified on the approved soil
conservation plan.
(4) Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed areas during construction.
(5) The permanent (final) vegetation and mechanical erosion control
measures shall both be installed within the time period specified on
the approved soil conservation plan.
(6) Until a disturbed area is stabilized, sediment in the runoff water
shall be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt
traps or similar measures, as more specifically may be determined
in any particular instance by the City Engineer.
(7) Provision shall be made to prevent surface water runoff from
damaging the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fill.
(8) All fill shall be compacted to provide stability of materials and to
prevent undesirable settlement.
(9) Fill shall not encroach on natural watercourses or constructed
channels.
(10) Fill placed adjacent to or having an impact upon natural
watercourses, constructed channels or floodplains shall have
suitable protection against erosion during periods of flooding, as
determined necessary by the City Engineer.
(11) During grading operations, appropriate measures for dust control
shall be exercised.
§ 170-15 SIGNS § 170-15
165:595
§ 170-16. Lots.
(12) Grading equipment shall not be allowed to enter into or cross any
watercourse, except when specifically set forth on the approved
erosion and sediment control plan.
F. Preservation of vegetation. [Added 5-21-1986 by L.L. No. 7-1986]
(1) The applicant shall be guided by the requirements of the Best
Management Practices Manuals and shall follow such specific
requirements as the City Engineer shall determine.
(2) The applicant shall restore vegetative cover in disturbed areas as
directed by the City Engineer.
(3) Stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall be
done in such a way as to minimize erosion.
(4) Whenever feasible, natural vegetation, and in particular trees, shall
be retained, protected and supplemented.
(5) The permanent (final) vegetation and mechanical erosion control
measures shall be installed as soon as practicable, but in no event
after the time specified on the approved control plan.
A. Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other
conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in
compliance with the Zoning Ordinance,46 and in providing access to
buildings on such lots from an approved street.
B. Access across a watercourse. Where a watercourse separates the
buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provision
shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure of a size
and design approved by the City Engineer.
C. Grading for driveways. Grading for driveways shall be in accordance
with Section 9-4.86 (b) of the Zoning Ordinance.47
D. Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum
standards of the Zoning Ordinance. Where lots are more than double
the minimum required area for the zoning district, the Planning
Commission may require that such lots be arranged so as to allow
further subdivision and the opening of future streets where they would
be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in compliance with the
Zoning Ordinance and these regulations.
E. Corner lots. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for
erection of buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback from
both streets.

165:596
§ 170-17. Reservations and easements.
F. Side lot lines. Side lot lines shall be generally at right angles or radial to
street lines unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or
lot plan.
G. Access from major streets. Lots shall not, in general, derive access
exclusively from a major street. Where driveway access from a major
street may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the Planning
Commission may require that such lots be served by a minor stain order
to limit possible traffic hazard on such street.
H. Water bodies. If a tract being subdivided contains a private water body
or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute the entire
ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots. The
Planning Commission may approve an alternative plan whereby the
ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body
is so placed that it will not become a city responsibility.
I. Setback building lines and house locations. Lots and streets shall be so
laid out as to make possible an attractive arrangement of buildings. In
cases where the Planning Commission considers it necessary in order
to avoid unattractive monotony, the Commission may require the
showing on the plat of specific setback building lines, which may vary
from lot to lot and may provide a setback from the street greater than is
required under the Zoning Ordinance. The Commission may also
designate approximate house locations for each lot. Such setback line
or house location shall constitute a deed restriction upon the placement
of the buildings upon each lot affected. In order to provide a suitable lot
for any existing house to be retained in a subdivision, each proposed lot
line shall be located away from the building a distance equal to the
normal minimum yard dimension or a distance equal to half the sum of
the length and height of the building facade parallel or substantially
parallel with that proposed lot line, whichever is greater. [Amended
11-15-1967]
A. Parks and playgrounds. [Amended 2-19-1964; 6-15-1965]
(1) Land shall be reserved for park and playground purposes in
locations designated on the City Development Plan or Official Map
or otherwise where the Planning Commission shall deem such
reservation to be appropriate. Each reservation shall be of suitable
size, dimension, topography and general character for park and
playground purposes and shall have adequate street access for the
purpose. The area shall be shown and marked on the plat as
"reserved for park or playground purposes." The Planning
Commission shall determine the amount of land to be reserved but
in no case more than 10% of the land in the subdivision, excluding
land in any lot with an existing house. Where the Planning
Commission deems, with respect to a particular subdivision, that a
reservation of land would be inadequate in size for park or
§ 170-16 SIGNS § 170-17
165:597
playground use, either alone or in conjunction with abutting
reservations on adjoining subdivisions, or otherwise inappropriate
for such use, the Planning Commission may waive the requirement
for such reservation, subject to the condition that the subdivider
deposit with the City Comptroller a cash payment in lieu of land
reservation. In such event, the Commission may accept either a
payment to the city of an amount calculated based on the fee
schedule, excluding land in any lot with an existing house and
land within any proposed street right-of-way, or any equivalent
combination of land in the subdivision and money. [Amended
2-7-1990 by L.L. No. 3-1990; 12-16-1998 by L.L. No. 13-1998]
(a) The City Council shall set the cash payment annually by
resolution before adoption of the budget.
(b) In the event that a lot in a subdivision for which cash payment
was made in lieu of parkland reservation is subsequently
further subdivided, the amount of the cash payment for the
new subdivision shall be limited to the difference between that
portion of the prior cash payment attributable to that lot and
the cash payment for the new subdivision calculated using the
current fee schedule. All such cash payments in lieu of
parkland reservation shall be placed in a special park fund.
Money from such fund heretofore or hereafLer deposited
therein shall be used only for the purchase and development of
sites for parks and playgrounds beneficial to residents of the
subdivisions from which the cash payments were collected. No
disbursement from such fund shall be made by the Council of
the City of Rye unless it finds that the proposed use of the
funds satisfies the aforesaid condition.
(2) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to land zoned for
and proposed to be subdivided for business purposes.
(3) Courts and pools. [Added 2-17-1988 by L.L. No. 3-1988]
(a) Outdoor tennis courts, paddle courts, racquet courts and other
similar courts, swimming pools and other active recreational
facilities, to be located in areas reserved for park and
playground purpose, shall be subject to the following
restrictions:
[1] They shall be set back from all property lines of abutting
properties not included in the subdivision a distance at
least equal to the number of proposed residences times 20
feet in R-1 Districts and 15 feet in all other districts, but
not to exceed 300 feet and not less than 20 feet from any
proposed lot in the subdivision.
[2] They shall be screened, including accessory equipment,
from the view of the street and abutting residentially
§ 170-17 RYE CODE § 170-17
165:598
zoned properties. Such screening shall, at a minimum,
consist of a ten-foot-wide landscape strip planted and
maintained with at least a double row of alternately spaced
evergreens, with an actual height of at least six feet above
the natural grade when installed.
[3] Fence heights shall not be in excess of six feet above the
average natural grade, except that fences not exceeding a
height of 10 feet above the average natural grade, which
are open mesh and are set back and screened, as required
for tennis and other similar courts, are permitted and may
be equipped with the customary attached windbreaks.
[4] Tennis and other similar courts shall have no lighting.
[5] Swimming pools shall have no floodlighting, directly or
indirectly, and all other lighting shall be arranged and
shaded so as to reflect light away from adjoining premises
or a public street.
[6] Swimming pools shall be completely surrounded by
fences, freestanding walls and/or the walls of a building
containing no doors, at least four feet high above grade at
all points, and each gate or door opening through the
fence or freestanding wall shall be equipped with a selfclosing
and self-latching device for keeping the gate or
door securely closed at all times and shall be locked when
the pool is not in actual use.
[7] Swimming pools shall be located at least 25 feet away from
any septic tank and its fields.
(b) The Planning Commission may modify these requirements
where, in its judgment, it deems such modifications desirable
and appropriate because of characteristics of the specific site,
such as topography, size, shape and location and proximity to
facilities such as streets, schools, public buildings and
facilities, other recreational facilities and similar active use
areas.
B. Utility and drainage easements. Where topography or other conditions
are such as to make impractical the inclusion of utilities or drainage
facilities within street rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements
of appropriate width for such utilities shall be provided across property
outside the street lines and with satisfactory access to the street.
C. Easements for pedestrian access. The Planning Commission may
require, in order to facilitate pedestrian access from streets to schools,
parks, playgrounds or other nearby streets, perpetual unobstructed
easements at least 20 feet in width. Easements shall be indicated on the
plat.

D. Responsibility for ownership of land reservations. Title, if vested or to
be vested in interests other than the sub-divider, shall be clearly
indicated on all reservations for park and playground purposes, in
accordance with § 170-8D(2).
E. Reserve strips prohibited. Reserve strips of land, which might be used
to control access from the proposed subdivision to any neighboring
property or to any land within the subdivision itself, shall be prohibited.
The entire area of the subdivision shall be distributed among lots,
streets and parks and playgrounds as shown on the plat.
A. Preservation of existing features. Existing features which would add
value to residential development, such as trees, watercourses and falls,
historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved,
insofar as possible, through harmonious design of the subdivision. In
connection with the preservation of landmarked properties, the
Commission shall use the authority granted it by § 117-9 of this Code.
[Amended 11-11-1989 by L.L. No. 14-1989]
B. Self-imposed restrictions. The owner may place restrictions on any of
the land contained in the subdivision greater than those required by the
Zoning Ordinance. Such restrictions shall be indicated on the
subdivision plat.
C. Subdivisions including land zoned for business. If a proposed
subdivision includes land that is zoned for business purposes and if
such land is not restricted against business use by the imposition of
deed restrictions by the owner, the layout of the subdivision with
respect to such land shall make such provision as the Planning
Commission may require for safe and convenient access to such
automobile parking and loading and unloading spaces as may be
required by the Zoning Ordinance or otherwise for safe and convenient
service access to such land.
D. The Planning Commission, as a condition of approval, may require the
filing of restrictive covenants, easements, deed restrictions,
declarations, agreements, deeds and other legal instruments it deems
necessary to ensure compliance with chapter, other chapters of this
Code and the State Environmental Quality Review Act48 in the Land
Records Division of the Westchester County Clerk's office. [Added
4-3-1991 by L.L. No. 4-1991]
E. Conditions of approval authorized by this chapter shall be enforced in
the same manner as provided for building permits, surface water,
erosion and sedimentation control permits and zoning in this Code, and
no building permit, certificate of occupancy or other permit shall be
issued for development or use of such property except in conformity

Where the Planning Commission finds that extraordinary hardships may
result from strict compliance with these regulations, it may adjust the
regulations so that substantial justice maybe done and the public interest
secured; provided that any such adjustment will not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations, the City Development

ARTICLE I
Erosion and Sediment Control
[Adopted 12-12-2007 by L.L. No. 8-2007; amended 9-11-2013 by L.L.
No. 1-2013]
§ 174-1. Findings of fact.
It has been determined by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation (NYSDEC) that:
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne
pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the state;
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
§ 174-1 SIGNS § 174-2
165:611
§ 174-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health,
safety, and welfare of the public residing within the City and to address the
State's findings of fact in § 174-1 hereof. This article seeks to meet those
purposes by achieving the following objectives:
§ 174-3. Statutory authority.
In accordance with § 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law of the State of
New York, the City Council of the City of Rye has the authority to enact local
laws and amend local laws and for the purpose of promoting the health,
safety or general welfare of the City of Rye and for the protection and
enhancement of its physical environment. The City Council of the City of
Rye may include in any such local law provisions for the appointment of
any municipal officer, employees, or independent contractor to effectuate,
administer and enforce such local law.
§ 174-4. Applicability.
A. Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of New York
State's SPDES General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from
Municipal Separate Stormwater Sewer Systems (MS4s), Permit No.
GP-02-02, or as amended or revised;
B. Require land development and redevelopment activities to conform to
the substantive requirements of the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES)
General Permit for Construction Activities GP02-01, or as amended or
revised;
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development and
redevelopment activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases
in stream temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the
integrity of stream channels, watercourses or waterways;
D. Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land
development and redevelopment activities which would otherwise
degrade local water quality;
E. Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development and
redevelopment to the maximum extent practicable; and
F. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
practices, devices and/or structures, and to ensure that these
management practices, devices and/or structures are properly
maintained and eliminate threats to public safety.

deed restriction on the property prior to final plan approval. The
maintenance agreement shall be consistent with the terms and
conditions of Schedule B of this article, entitled "Sample Stormwater
Control Facility Maintenance Agreement."49 The City, in lieu of a
maintenance agreement, at its sole discretion, may accept dedication of
any existing or future stormwater management facility, provided such
facility meets all the requirements of this article and includes adequate
and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for
inspection and regular maintenance.
A. Inspection.
(1) The City Engineer may require such inspections as necessary to
determine compliance with this article and may either approve that
portion of the work completed or notify the applicant wherein the
work fails to comply with the requirements of this article and the
stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as approved. To
obtain inspections, the applicant shall notify the City enforcement
official at least 48 hours before any of the following as required by

inspector is required to submit a report. All applicants are required to
submit as-built plans for any stormwater management practices located
on site after final construction is completed. The plan must show the
final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and
must be certified by a professional engineer.
C. Inspection of stormwater facilities after project completion. Inspection
programs shall be established on any reasonable basis, including but
not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections; inspections
based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; inspection
of drainage basins or areas identified as higher-than-typical sources of
sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses
or industries of a type associated with higher-than-usual discharges of
contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more
likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or federal
water or sediment quality standards or the NYSDEC SPDES General
Stormwater Permit; and joint inspections with other agencies
inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may
include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair
records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and
material or water in drainage control facilities; and evaluating the
condition of drainage control facilities and other stormwater
management practices.
D. Submission of reports. The City Engineer may require monitoring and
reporting from entities subject to this article as are necessary to
determine compliance with this article.
E. Right-of-entry for inspection. When any new stormwater management
facility is installed on private property or when any new connection is
made between private property and the public stormwater system, the
landowner shall grant to the City the right to enter the property at
reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of
inspection as specified in § 174-10C.
A. Construction completion guarantee. In order to ensure the full and
faithful completion of all land development activities related to
compliance with all conditions set forth by the City in its approval of the
stormwater pollution prevention plan, the City may require the
applicant or developer to provide, prior to construction, a performance
bond, cash escrow, or irrevocable letter of credit from an appropriate
financial or surety institution which guarantees satisfactory completion
of the project and names the City as the beneficiary. The security shall
be in an amount equal to 20% of the anticipated cost of the work
covered by the permit issued for the project, not to exceed $5,000 or in
an amount to be determined by the City based on submission of final
design plans, with reference to actual construction and landscaping
costs. The performance guarantee shall remain in force until the surety
§ 174-10 SIGNS § 174-11
165:625
§ 174-12. Enforcement; penalties for offenses.
is released from liability by the City, provided that such period shall not
be less than one year from the date of final acceptance or such other
certification that the facility(ies) have been constructed in accordance
with the approved plans and specifications and that a one-year
inspection has been conducted and the facilities have been found to be
acceptable to the City. Per annum interest on cash escrow deposits shall
be reinvested in the account until the surety is released from liability.
B. Maintenance guarantee. Where stormwater management and erosion
and sediment control facilities are to be operated and maintained by the
developer or by a corporation that owns or manages a commercial or
industrial facility, the developer, prior to construction, may be required
to provide the City with an irrevocable letter of credit from an approved
financial institution or surety to ensure proper operation and
maintenance of all stormwater management and erosion control
facilities both during and after construction, and until the facilities are
removed from operation. If the developer or landowner fails to properly
operate and maintain stormwater management and erosion and
sediment control facilities, the City may draw upon the account to cover
the costs of proper operation and maintenance, including engineering
and inspection costs.
C. Recordkeeping. The City may require entities subject to this article to
maintain records demonstrating compliance with this article.
A. Notice of violation. When the City determines that a land development
or redevelopment activity is not being carried out in accordance with
the requirements of this article, it may issue a written notice of violation
to the landowner. The notice of violation shall contain:
(1) The name and address of the landowner, developer or applicant;
(2) The address, when available, or a description of the building,
structure or land upon which the violation is occurring;
(3) A statement specifying the nature of the violation;
(4) A description of the remedial measures necessary to bring the land
development or redevelopment activity into compliance with this
article and a time schedule for the completion of such remedial
action;
(5) A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be
assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is
directed;
(6) A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to
the City by filing a written notice of appeal within 15 days of service
of notice of violation.

B. Stop-work orders. The City may issue a stop-work order for violations of
this article. Persons receiving a stop-work order shall be required to
halt all land development or redevelopment activities, except those
activities that address the violations leading to the stop-work order. The
stop-work order shall be in effect until the City confines that the land
development or redevelopment activity is in compliance and the
violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure to address a stopwork
order in a timely manner may result in civil, criminal, or monetary
penalties in accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in
this article.
C. Violations. Any land development or redevelopment activity that is
commenced or is conducted contrary to this article may be restrained
by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law.
D. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this article
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $350 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense, both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a
fine not less than $350 nor more than $700 or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed six months, or both; and upon conviction for a third
or subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a period of
five years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than $1,000
or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both.
However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and
judicial officers generally, violations of this article shall be deemed
misdemeanors and for such purpose only all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
E. Withholding of certificate of occupancy. If any building or land
development or redevelopment activity is installed or conducted in
violation of this article, the City Engineer may prevent the occupancy of
said building or land.
F. Restoration of lands. Any violator may be required to restore land to its
undisturbed condition. In the event that restoration is not undertaken
within a reasonable time after notice, the City may take necessary
corrective action, the cost of which shall become a lien upon the
property until paid.
A. The City may require any person undertaking land development or
redevelopment activities regulated by this article to pay reasonable
costs at prevailing rates for review of SWPPPs, inspections, or SMP
maintenance performed by the City or performed by a third party for
the City.

ARTICLE I
Tax on Income of Utilities
[Adopted 6-21-1944 by L.L. No. 1-1944]
§ 177-1. Legislative intent.
By § 20-b of the General City Laws, as added by Chapter 321 of the Laws
of 1937, and as amended by Chapter 245 of the Laws of 1942, cities are
authorized to enact local laws imposing a tax such as is imposed by § 186-a
of the Tax Law. Pursuant to such authority, this Article is modeled upon said
§ 186-a. It is intended thereby and likewise by this Article, enacted pursuant
to the above-mentioned authority, to impose a tax on utility services,
whether rendered by utilities in the strict sense or not, and whether such
services are in the main or incidental part of their business and regardless
of whether the public streets are used in any manner. Accordingly, such
a utility is defined for the purposes of the tax as including every person
subject to the supervision of the Department of Public Service and every
other person furnishing utility services. It is intended to include persons and
corporations which are directly in competition with ordinary utilities, such
as landlords and submeterers, who buy their services from other utilities
and in turn resell such services. For that reason the tax is imposed in
receipts from sales to ultimate consumers. Receipts from the sale of such
utility services to submeterers are not taxed, but receipts of submeterers
from their own customers are intended to be taxed. Any other construction
would result in a complete exemption from taxation of utility services sold
or furnished by this particular method. Furthermore, it is believed that
submeterers have common characteristics that distinguish them from other
businesses and justify the conclusion that the method, character and nature
of their business, in this aspect, is substantially similar to the business of
an ordinary utility and requires similar treatment for the purposes of the
tax. This conclusion is strongly fortified by the fact that such landlords
and submeterers are in direct competition with ordinary utilities and hence
should bear similar tax burdens in order to avoid inequality of treatment.
§ 177-2. Imposition of tax. [Amended 7-18-1945 by L.L. No. 1-1945;
6-19-1946 by L.L. No. 2-1946; 6-18-1947 by L.L. No. 2-1947;

Pursuant to the authority granted by § 20-b of the General City Law of the
State of New York, a tax equal to 1% of its gross income from and after July
1, 1950, is hereby imposed upon every utility doing business in the City of
Rye which is subject to the supervision of the State Department of Public
Service, which has a gross income for the 12 months ending May 31 in
excess of $500, except motor carriers or brokers subject to such supervision
under Article 3-B of the Public Service Law,50 and a tax equal to 1% of its
gross operating income is hereby imposed from and after July 1, 1937, upon

every utility doing business in the City of Rye which has a gross operating
income for the 12 months ending May 31 in excess of $500, which taxes
shall have application only within the territorial limits of the City of Rye and
shall be in addition to any and all other taxes and fees imposed by any other
provision of law for the same period. Such taxes shall not be imposed on
any transaction originating or consummated outside of the territorial limits
of the City of Rye, notwithstanding that some act be necessarily performed
with respect to such transaction within such limits.

districts.
UTILITY  Includes every person subject to the supervision of either
division of the State Department of Public Service, except persons engaged
in the business of operating or leasing sleeping and parlor railroad cars
or of operating railroads other than street surface, rapid transit, subway

telephone or telegraph service, by means of mains, pipes or wires;
regardless of whether such activities are the main business of such person
or are only incidental thereto, or of whether use is made of the public
streets.
§ 177-4. Keeping of business records.
Every utility subject to tax under this Article shall keep such records of its
business and in such form as the City Comptroller may require, and such
records shall be preserved for a period of three years, except that the City
Comptroller may consent to their destruction within that period or may
require that they be kept longer.
§ 177-5. Filing of quarterly returns. [Amended 7-18-1945 by L.L.
No. 1-1945; 6-19-1946 by L.L. No. 2-1946; 6-18-1947 by L.L. No.
2-1947; 5-19-1948 by L.L. No. 1-1948; 5-18-1949 by L.L. No. 1-1949;
6-21-1950 by L.L. No. 1-1950]
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file, on or before September
25, December 25, March 25 an June 25, a return for the three calendar
months preceding each such return date, including any period for which
the tax imposed hereby or by any amendment hereof is effective, each of
which returns shall state the gross income or gross operating income for
the period covered by each such return. Returns shall be filed with the City
Comptroller on a form to be furnished by him for such purpose and shall
contain such other data, information or matter as the City Comptroller may
require to be included therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this section, any utility whose average gross income or average gross
operating income, as the case may be, for the aforesaid three months'
periods is less than $1,500, may file a return annually on June 25 for the
12 preceding calendar months, and the City Comptroller may require any
utility doing business in the City of Rye to file an annual return, which shall
contain any data specified by the City Comptroller, regardless of whether
the utility is subject to tax under this Article. The City Comptroller, in order
to ensure payment of the tax imposed, may require at any time a further or
supplemental return, which shall contain any data that may be specified by
the City Comptroller. Every return shall have annexed thereto an affidavit
of the head of the utility making the same, or of a copartner thereof, or
§ 177-3 SIGNS § 177-5
165:633
of a principal officer of the corporation, if such business is conducted by a
corporation, to the effect that the statements contained therein are true.
§ 177-6. Payment of tax.
At the time of filing a return as required by this Article, each utility shall
pay to the City Comptroller the tax imposed by this Article for the period
covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which
the return is required to be filed.
§ 177-7. Determination of tax by City Comptroller; review.
In case any return filed pursuant to this Article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the City Comptroller, and if acorrect or sufficient return is
not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice from the City
Comptroller, or if no return is made for any period, the City Comptroller
shall determine the amount of tax due from such information as he is
able to obtain, and if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of
external indices or otherwise. The City Comptroller shall give notice of
such determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination
shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the person against whom
it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving of notice of such
determination, apply to the City Comptroller for a hearing, or unless the
City Comptroller, of his own motion, shall reduce the same. After such
hearing, the City Comptroller shall give notice of his decision to the person
liable for the tax. The decision of the City Comptroller may be reviewed
by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Act of the State of
New York if application therefor is made within 30 days after the giving
of notice of such decision. An order to review such decision shall not
be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with
interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the City
Comptroller and an undertaking filed with him in such amount and with
such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect
that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the applicant
will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such
proceeding, or at the option of the applicant, such undertaking may be
in a sum sufficient to cover the tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges
aforesaid, in which event the applicant shall not be required to pay such
tax, interest and penalties as a condition precedent to the granting of such
order.
§ 177-8. Giving of notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this Article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this Article, or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
§ 177-5 RYE CODE § 177-8
165:634
whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this Article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 177-9. Penalty for late payment.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax or
any portion thereof within the time required by this Article shall be subject
to a penalty of 5% of the amount of the tax due, plus 1% of such tax for
each month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after
such return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the City
Comptroller, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any
portion of such penalty.
§ 177-10. Refunds.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof
shall make application for a refund thereof and the City Comptroller or
the court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof
was erroneously or illegally collected, the City Comptroller shall refund
the amount so determined. For like cause and within the same period, a
refund may be so made on the initiative of the City Comptroller. However,
no refund shall be made of a tax penalty paid pursuant to a determination of
the City Comptroller as hereinbefore provided unless the City Comptroller,
after a hearing as hereinbefore provided or of his own motion, shall have
reduced the tax or penalty or it shall have been established in a proceeding
under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Act of the State of New York that
such determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made out
of moneys collected under this Article. An application for a refund, made
as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for the revision
of any tax or penalty complained of, and the City Comptroller may receive
additional evidence with respect thereto. After making his determination,
the City Comptroller shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and
he shall be entitled to an order to review such determination under said
Article 78, subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained relating to the
granting of such an order.
§ 177-11. Source of tax payments.
The tax imposed by this Article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 177-12. Action to enforce payment.

he/she may require any operator required to collect the tax imposed by this
article to file with him/her a bond, issued by a surety company authorized
to transact business in this state and approved by the Superintendent of
Insurance of this state as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount
as the City Comptroller may find to secure the payment of any tax and/or
penalties and interest due or which may become due from such operator.
In the event that the City Comptroller determines that an operator is to
file such bonds, he/she shall give notice to such operator to that effect,
specifying the amount of the bond required. The operator shall file such
bond within five days after the giving of such notice unless, within such
five days, the operator shall request in writing a hearing before the City
Comptroller at which the necessity, propriety and amount of the bond shall
be determined by the City Comptroller. Such determination shall be final
and shall be complied with within 15 days after the giving of notices thereof.
In lieu of such bond, securities approved by the City Comptroller or cash
in such amount as he/she may prescribe may be deposited with him/her,
which shall be kept in the custody of the City Comptroller, who may at any
time, without notice of the depositor, apply them to any tax and/or interest
City Comptroller may permit or require returns to be made by other
periods and upon such dates as he/she may specify. If the City
Comptroller deems it necessary in order to ensure the payment of the
tax imposed by this article, he/she may require returns to be made
for shorter periods than those prescribed pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this section and upon such dates as he/she may specify.
B. The forms of return shall be prescribed by the City Comptroller and
shall contain such information as he/she may deem necessary for the
proper administration of this article. The City Comptroller may require
amended returns to be filed within 20 days after notice and to contain
the information specified in the notice.
C. If a return required by this article is not filed, or if a return is
incorrectly filed or is insufficient on its face, the City Comptroller shall
take such steps as he/she deems necessary to enforce the filing of such
return or of a corrected return.

or penalties due, and for that purpose the securities may be sold by him/her
at public or private sale without notice to the depositor thereof.
§ 177-52. Determination of tax.
If a return required by local law is not filed or if a return, when filed,
is incorrect or insufficient, the amount of tax due shall be determined by
the City Comptroller from such information as may be obtainable, and, if
necessary, the tax may be estimated on the basis of external indices, such
as number of rooms, locations, scale of rents, comparable rents, type of
accommodations and service, number of employees and/or other factors.
Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the
collection and/or payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally and
irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed, within
30 days after giving notice of such determination, shall apply to the City
Comptroller for a hearing or unless the City Comptroller on his/her own
motion shall redetermine the same. After such hearing, the City Comptroller
shall give notice of his/her determination to the person against whom
the tax is assessed. The determination of the City Comptroller shall be
reviewable for error, illegality, unconstitutionality or any other recognizable
basis whatsoever by proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules if application therefor is made to the Supreme Court within 30
days after the giving of the notice of such determination. A proceeding
under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules shall not be instituted
unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and
interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the City Comptroller
and there shall be filed with the City Comptroller an undertaking, issued
by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and
approved by the Superintendent of Insurance of this state as to solvency
and responsibility, in such amount as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall
approve to the effect that, if such proceedings be dismissed or the tax
confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue,
including reasonable counsel fees, in the prosecution of the proceeding,
or, at the option of the applicant, such undertaking filed with the City
Comptroller may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and
interest thereon stated in such determination plus the costs and charges,
including reasonable counsel fees, which may accrue against it in the
prosecution of the proceedings, in which event the applicant shall not
be required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition
precedent to the application.
§ 177-53. Disposition of revenues.
All revenue resulting from the imposition of the tax under this article shall
be paid into the treasury of the City and shall be credited to and deposited
in the general fund of the City.
§ 177-54. Refunds.
§ 177-51 RYE CODE § 177-54
165:658
A. In the manner provided in this section, the City Comptroller shall
refund or credit, without interest, any tax penalty or interest
erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid if
application to the City Comptroller for such refund shall be made within
one year from the payment thereof. Whenever a refund is made by the
City Comptroller, he/she shall state his/her reason therefor in writing.
Such application may be made by the occupant, operator or other
person who has actually paid the tax. Such application may also be
made by an operator who has collected and paid over such tax to the
City Comptroller, provided that the application is made within one year
of the payment by the occupant to the operator, but no actual refund of
moneys shall be made to such operator until he/she shall first establish
to the satisfaction of the City Comptroller, under such regulations as the
City Comptroller may prescribe, that he/she has repaid to the occupant
the amount for which the application for refund is made. The City
Comptroller may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit
therefor on payments due or to become due from the applicant.
B. An application for a refund or credit made as herein provided shall be
deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest
complained of, and the City Comptroller may receive evidence with
respect thereto. After making his/her determination, the City
Comptroller shall give notice thereof to the applicant, who shall be
entitled to review such determination by a proceeding pursuant to
Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, provided that such
proceeding is instituted within 30 days after the giving of the notice of
such determination, and provided that a final determination of tax due
was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted
unless an undertaking is filed with the City Comptroller in such amount
and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve
to the effect that, if such proceedings be dismissed or the tax confirmed,
the petitioner will pay costs and charges which may accrue in the
prosecution of such proceeding.
C. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this
section of a tax, interest or penalty which had been determined to be
due pursuant to the provisions of § 177-52 of this article where he/she
has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said
section, or has failed to avail himself of the remedies therein provided.
No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after
a determination by the City Comptroller made pursuant to § 177-52 of
this article unless it be found that such determination was erroneous,
illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper by the City
Comptroller after a hearing or on his/her own motion or in a proceeding
under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, pursuant to the
provisions of said section, in which event refund or credit without
interest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been
overpaid.
§ 177-54 SIGNS § 177-55
165:659
§ 177-55. Reserves.
In cases where the occupant or operator has applied for a refund and has
instituted a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules
to review a determination adverse to him/her on his/her application for
refund, the City Comptroller shall have the option of crediting future tax
payments to meet the cost of any settlements or judgments or, at his/her
option, may, in the first instance, set up appropriate reserves to meet any
decision adverse to the City.
§ 177-56. Remedies exclusive.
The remedies provided by §§ 177-52 and 177-54 of this article shall be the
exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability
imposed by this article, and no determination or proposed determination
of tax or determination on any application for refund shall be enjoined or
reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money had
and received or by any action or proceeding other than a proceeding in a
nature of a certiorari proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer may proceed by declaratory
judgment if he/she institutes suit within 30 days after a deficiency
assessment is made and pays the amount of the deficiency assessment to
the City Comptroller prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond
for costs as provided in § 177-52 of this article.
§ 177-57. Proceedings to recover tax.
A. Whenever any operator or any officer of a corporate operator or any
occupant or other person shall fail to collect and pay over any tax and/
or to pay any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this article as therein
provided, the City Corporation Counsel shall, upon the request of the
City Comptroller, bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the
payment of the same on behalf of the City of Rye in any court of the
State of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If,
however, the City Comptroller in his/her discretion believes that any
such operator, officer, occupant or other person is about to cease
business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which
the tax or penalties might be satisfied, and that any such tax or penalty
will not be paid when due, he/she may declare such tax or penalty to be
immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.
B. As an additional or alternate remedy, the City Comptroller may direct
the City Assessor to, in the preparation of the next assessment roll,
assess the amount of such tax or penalty upon the property occupied by
business giving rise to such tax or penalty, and this amount shall be
levied, collected and enforced in the same manner as taxes upon said
property for City purposes are levied collected, and enforced.
C. Whenever an operator shall make a sale, transfer or assignment in bulk
of any part of the whole of his/her hotel or its assets or his/her lease,
license or other agreement or right to possess or operate such facility

purchaser, transferee or assignee is required to transfer over, the seller,
transferor or assignor shall be subject to a first priority right and lien
for any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due from
the seller, transferor or assignor to the City, and the purchaser,
transferee or assignee is forbidden to transfer to the seller, transferor
or assignor any such sums of money, property or choses in action to the
extent of the amount of the City's claim. For failure to comply with the

assignor, and such liability may be assessed and enforced in the same
manner as the liability for tax under this article.

may be given to the person to whom it is intended in a postpaid
envelope addressed to such person at the address given in the last
return filed by him/her pursuant to the provisions of this article or in

assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing
that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due
may be determined at any time within such extended period. The period
so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing
made before the expiration of the extended period.

§ 177-65. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to grant Cold War veterans who meet the
requirements set forth in § 458-b of the New York State Real Property Tax
Law with a real property tax exemption.
§ 177-66. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ACTIVE DUTY  Full-time duty in the United States Armed Forces, other
than active duty for training.
ARMED FORCES  The United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force,
and Coast Guard.
COLD WAR VETERAN  A person, male or female, who served on active
duty in the United States Armed Forces, during the time period from
September 2, 1945, to December 26, 1991, was discharged or released
therefrom under honorable conditions and satisfies any other requirements
set forth in § 458-b(1)(a) of the New York State Real Property Tax Law.
LATEST CLASS RATIO  The latest final class ratio established by the
New York State Board of Real Property Tax Services pursuant to Title 1 of

Law.
LATEST STATE EQUALIZATION RATE  State equalization rate or special
equalization rate established by the New York State Board of Real Property
Tax Services pursuant to Article 12 of the New York State Real Property
Tax Law. The New York State Board of Real Property Tax Services shall
establish a special equalization if it finds that here has been a material
change in the level of assessment since the establishment of the latest
state equalization rate, but in no event shall such special equalization
rate exceed 100. In the event that the state equalization rate exceeds
100, then the state equalization rate shall be 100 for the purposes of this
section. Where a special equalization rate is established for purposes of
this section, the Assessor is directed and authorized to recompute the
Cold War veterans exemption on the assessment roll by applying special
equalization rate instead of the latest state equalization rate applied in the
previous year and to make the appropriate corrections on the assessment
roll, notwithstanding the fact that such Assessor may receive the special
equalization rate after the completion, verification and filing of such final
assessment roll. In the event that the Assessor does not have custody of the

recomputed Cold War veterans exemption certified by the Assessor on such
roll.
QUALIFIED OWNER  A Cold War veteran, the spouse of a Cold War
veteran, or the unremarried surviving spouse of a deceased Cold War
veteran. Where property is owned by more than one qualified owner, the
exemption to which each is entitled may be combined. Where a veteran is
also the unremarried surviving spouse of a veteran, such person may also
receive any exemption to which the deceased spouse was entitled.
QUALIFIED RESIDENTIAL REAL PROPERTY  Property owned by a
qualified owner which is used exclusively for residential purposes; provided,
however, that in the event that any portion of such property is not used
exclusively for residential purposes, but is used for other purposes, such
portion shall be subject to taxation and only the remaining portion used
exclusively for residential purposes shall be subject to the exemption
provided by this section. Such property shall be the primary residence of
the Cold War veteran or the unremarried surviving spouse of a Cold War
veteran, unless the Cold War veteran or unremarried surviving spouse is

to such time limitations, if any, as are set forth in § 458-b(l)(f) of the New
York State Real Property Tax Law.

assessing unit, or, in the case of a special assessing unit, the latest class
ratio, whichever is less.
B. In addition to the exemption provided by Subsection A of this section,
where the Cold War veteran received a compensation rating from the
United States Department of Veterans Affairs or from the United States
Department of Defense because of a service-related disability,
qualifying residential real property shall be exempt from taxation to the
extent of the product of the assessed value of such property multiplied
by 50% of the Cold War veteran disability rating; provided, however,
that such exemption shall not exceed $180,000 or the product of
$180,000 multiplied by the latest state equalization rate for the
assessing unit, or, in the case of a special assessing unit, the latest class
ratio, whichever is less.
§ 177-66 RYE CODE § 177-67
165:668
§ 177-68. Property held in trust.
The provisions of this article shall apply to any real property held in trust

ARTICLE XI
Abatement for Rent-Controlled and Rent-Regulated Property
Occupied by Senior Citizens or Persons with Disabilities
[Adopted 8-17-2009 by L.L. No. 8-2009]
§ 177-70. Purpose; legislative intent.
§ 177-71. Definitions.
A. Both SCRIE and DRIE provide eligible residents age 62 and older, who
live in rent-controlled or rent-stabilized apartments, an exemption to
rent increases if their incomes and the proportion of their income spent
on rent meet eligibility guidelines. This is available in New York City
and in several municipalities in Nassau and Westchester Counties.
When a landlord raises the rent, tenants with SCRIE/DRIE do not have
to pay the increased rate. Instead of the increased rent, the landlord is
eligible for an equivalent credit on his or her property taxes. The local
municipality then reduces the property taxes owed by the landlord in
the amount equivalent to the credit. The impact of this article will
depend on the number of eligible citizens, as well as the proposed rent
increase. Essentially, the noneligible residents of Rye will be paying for
any loss in tax revenue by the City of Rye from residents who qualify for
and are granted this rent increase exemption.
B. The City Council of the City of Rye finds it in the public interest to adopt
legislation in accordance with the enabling legislation enacted by the
State Legislature with respect to tax abatements of real property taxes
for senior citizens and disabled persons living in rent-regulated/rentcontrolled
properties.
A. The following terms "disabled person," "dwelling unit," "head of
household," "income," "income tax year," "increase in maximum rent or
legal regulated rent" and "members of the household," as used in this
article, shall have the definitions ascribed to them in the Real Property
Tax Law § 467-b, Subdivision 1.

indicated:

hereunder, whether received by the head of the household or any other
member of the household.

their own properties but may not be able to afford to do so when faced
with potential increases in taxation as the result of alterations which
would qualify for this exemption; and to provide a concrete benefit for
restoring or improving historically or architecturally significant
properties which are subject to the regulations of Chapter 117,

Real Property Assessment of Converted Condominiums
[Added 11-7-2018 by L.L. No. 7-2018]

§ 177-84. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following term shall have the meaning indicated:
CONVERTED CONDOMINIUM  A dwelling unit held in condominium
form of ownership that has previously been on an assessment roll as a
dwelling unit in other than condominium form of ownership and has not
been previously subject to the provisions of § 581, Subdivision 1(a), of the
Real Property Tax Law or § 399-y, Subdivision 1(b), of the Real Property Tax
Law.57
§ 177-85. Applicability.
In accordance with § 581, Subdivision 1(c), of the Real Property Tax Law
and § 399-y, Subdivision 1(f), of the Real Property Tax Law,58 which
otherwise permits condominium units to be valued for purposes of real
property assessment by using a capitalization of income approach or a cost
approach, neither § 581, Subdivision 1(a), of the Real Property Tax Law nor
§ 399-y, Subdivision 1(b), of the Real Property Tax Law shall apply to any
converted condominium units in the City of Rye.
A. The City Council hereby finds that residential condominium units incur
a significant difference in property taxes compared to comparably
priced single-family homes under conventional forms of property
ownership.
B. By reason of the foregoing, the City Council believes it is necessary to
adopt a local law to prevent residential property owners from
converting to a condominium form of ownership that would result in a
lower assessment, which, if permitted, would unfairly lower the
property tax burden for the converted property, while increasing the
property tax burden to owners of property in a conventional form of
ownership.
C. The City Council does hereby ordain and enact Article XIII to
accomplish the aforesaid purpose.

TAX LIENS, DISPOSITION OF
GENERAL REFERENCES
Tax administration  See Charter, Art. 22. Taxation  See Ch. 177.
§ 183-1. Sale of tax liens.
The right of the City of Rye, hereinafter referred to as the "city," to receive
taxes and assessments and the lien or liens therefor may be sold by the
city, and after such sale, shall be transferred in the manner provided by this
chapter. For the purposes of this chapter, each installment of an assessment
payable in annual installments shall be deemed a separate assessment. In
this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, the word "tax" shall
be interpreted as including water rents, expenses incurred in repairing,
grading and removing snow and ice from sidewalks and all other items
inserted in the annual tax roll and made a part of the annual tax upon
lands and tenements thereon. The right and lien so sold shall be called "tax
lien" and the instrument by which it is assigned shall be called "transfer
of tax lien." Whenever any tax or assessment on lands or tenements in the
City of Rye shall remain unpaid on the tax rolls of the City of Rye for the
previous year, the Comptroller shall advertise, in the manner hereinafter
provided, the tax liens on the said lands and tenements, including in such
advertisement the tax lien for all items due and unpaid for said year and
all years previous thereto, with interest thereon, up to a date named in
the advertisement, except the city taxes or assessments of the current
year for which a transfer of tax lien has not been sold, but including the
unpaid school taxes affecting such lands and tenements, and included in
such advertisement shall be a statement to the effect that the owner or
owners of such lands and tenements, respectively, shall be required to
pay the amount of such taxes and assessments with the penalties thereon
so remaining unpaid, to the time of payment, with the charges of such
notice and advertisement, to the said Comptroller, and notice shall be given
by such advertisement that if default shall be made in such payment on
or before the date specified in said notice, the tax lien on such lands
and tenements will be sold at public auction at a day and place therein
to be specified, for the lowest rate of interest, not exceeding 12% per
annum, at which any person or persons shall offer to take the same, in
consideration of advancing the aggregate sum of said taxes, assessments
and penalties, as the case may be, the interest thereon to the time of sale,
the charges of the above-mentioned notice and advertisement and all other
costs and charges accruing thereon; and if, notwithstanding such notice,
the owner or owners shall refuse or neglect to pay such tax, assessment
and penalties with interest as aforesaid and the charges attending such
notice and advertisement, then it shall and may be lawful for the said
Comptroller to cause such tax lien on said lands and tenements to be sold
§ 180-19 RYE CODE § 183-1
183:686
at public auction for the purpose and in the manner expressed in said
advertisement, and such sale shall be made on the day and at the place for
that purpose mentioned in said advertisement as aforesaid and such sale
shall be continued from time to time, if necessary, without further notice,
until all of the tax liens on the lands and tenements so advertised shall be
sold. The sale of tax liens under the provisions of this chapter shall be held
on the second Thursday of May in each year.
§ 183-2. Notice of sale.
No such sale of any tax lien for the nonpayment of any tax or assessment
as herein provided shall be held unless notice of such sale shall have
been published once in each week for the three consecutive weeks next
preceding the date fixed for such sale in the official newspaper of the city;
such sale shall take place on or after the 21st day and on or before the 28th
day after the day of the first publication. Any period of seven successive
days shall constitute a week under this section; said advertisement shall
contain appended to such notice a detailed statement of the property the
tax lien on which is to be sold, by giving the block and lot number or
numbers, together with such other description, if any, as the Comptroller
may direct, or the said Comptroller, at his option, may cause such detailed
statement and description of the premises the tax lien on which is to be sold
to be printed in a pamphlet, in which case copies of the pamphlet shall be
deposited in the Comptroller's office and shall be delivered to any person
applying therefor. Such detailed statement and description shall also give
the total sum for the nonpayment of which a tax lien is to be sold. In the
event that the Comptroller shall determine to print a pamphlet as aforesaid,
the notice provided for in this section to be given of the sale of tax liens
on lands and tenements shall state that the detailed statement of taxes and
assessments and the property taxes or assessments as aforesaid is to be in
pamphlet form and that copies of the pamphlet are deposited in the office of
the Comptroller and will be delivered to any person applying for the same.
No other notice or demand of the tax or assessment shall be required to
authorize the sale of tax or assessment liens on any lands and tenements as
hereinbefore provided. The Comptroller may cancel any transfer of tax lien
for unpaid taxes and assessments held by the City of Rye or to which the city
has acquired the right, and upon such cancellation the lien of such tax or
assessment shall be the same as if no sale for such unpaid tax or assessment
has been made.
§ 183-3. Authorization for additional sales.
In addition to the annual sale of tax liens as herein provided, the Council
may at any time direct the Comptroller to sell the lien of taxes and
assessments unpaid for more than one year since the same became due and
payable, in which case the Comptroller shall forthwith take the same steps
hereinbefore provided, without regard to the time limitations hereinbefore
specified, and offer such liens for sale in the same manner as hereinbefore
provided.
§ 183-1 TAX LIENS, DISPOSITION OF § 183-4
183:687
§ 183-4. Postponement of sales.
It shall be lawful for the Comptroller to suspend or postpone any sale or
sales of tax or assessment liens on lands and tenements or any portion
thereof which shall have been advertised for sale, to any time not exceeding
30 days from the day specified in any such advertisement. All sales which
shall be so postponed or suspended may be made without further
advertisement, other than a general notice of such postponement, to be
published once in the official newspaper of the city. Interest at the rate of
12% per annum shall be added to the amount of tax and assessment liens
for the period of such postponement.
§ 183-5. Comptroller to conduct sales.
The Comptroller or his deputy shall conduct the sales hereinbefore provided
to be made, and no auctioneer other than said Comptroller or his deputy
shall be employed to make such sale, and no auctioneer's fees shall be
charged thereon. The Comptroller shall require from each purchaser of a
tax or assessment lien at the time of such sale a deposit on account of
20% of the amount of the tax lien purchased by him, and not later than 30
days from the date of the sale, the balance shall be paid to the Comptroller
at his office. If no bid shall be received for a tax lien offered for sale,
the Comptroller on behalf of the City of Rye may bid in the said tax or
assessment lien, and upon such bid no deposit or payment in cash shall
be required from the city. When the city has bid in any tax or assessment
lien, a transfer of tax or assessment lien to the city shall be executed by
the said Comptroller in the form and manner prescribed for other transfers
of tax liens, and the city shall have the same rights in, to and under such
transfer of tax or assessment liens as if the same had been bought by any
other person. The city at any time either before or after the institution
of a foreclosure action may accept a deed of conveyance of the property
covered by the transfer of tax lien, conveying to the city the fee of said
premises, but such deed shall not be taken subject to any mortgage, lien,
judgment or other encumbrance, except unpaid taxes, leases and restrictive
covenants of record. The city shall sell any such property so acquired upon
such terms and for such sums as the Council may by resolution fix and
determine, and the Mayor on behalf of the city shall execute, acknowledge
and deliver a deed therefor. Transfers of tax or assessment liens shall be
made and delivered to the purchaser without charge upon payment of the
amounts therein shown to be due. In case any purchaser shall not complete
his purchase in accordance with the terms prescribed as herein provided,
then the amount deposited by him at the time of the sale shall be forfeited
to the city, and the entire tax or assessment lien upon the lands affected
by such purchase shall be sold again. Such resale shall be held at such
time as the Comptroller may direct, and shall be advertised in the official
newspaper of the city twice in the 10 days immediately preceding the sale.
All deposits forfeited as aforesaid shall be paid into the general fund of the
City of Rye.
§ 183-4 RYE CODE § 183-6
183:688
§ 183-6. Transfer of tax liens.
A transfer of tax lien shall operate to transfer and assign the tax lien
upon the lands or tenements described therein for taxes and assessments
with the penalties and interest thereon and the charges of the notices
and advertisement given pursuant to this chapter and all other costs and
charges so advertised for sale, and to create a lien upon property affected
thereby for the interest to which the purchaser may be entitled under his
bid, but such tax lien so sold shall be subject to all taxes and assessments,
including school taxes or interest acquired from the sale, or lease of the
premises for the same, which are still unpaid and due and owing to the city
and to the Town of Rye, and subject to tax liens and transfers of tax liens
which are still unpaid and due and owing to the city and to the Town of
Rye, also subject to all city taxes, special district assessments and school
taxes which have or may become a lien subsequent to the lien of the taxes
or assessments for which the tax lien is sold, also subject to any and all
subsequent transfer of tax lien against said premises. A transfer of tax lien
shall contain a transfer and assignment by the city of the tax lien sold
to the purchaser, the date of the sale, the aggregate amount of the lien
so transferred and the items of taxes, assessments, penalties and interest
composing the tax lien, the annual rate of interest which the purchaser has
bid and will be entitled to receive, the date when the amount of the tax
lien will be due and the description of the real property affected by the tax
lien, and shall refer for certainty to the designation of said property on the
Official City Map by its block and lot number and such other identifying
description as the Comptroller may deem proper to advertise. Each transfer
of tax lien shall be subscribed by the Comptroller or his deputy, or his
successor in office, and shall be acknowledged by the officer subscribing the
same in the manner in which a deed is required to be acknowledged to be
recorded in Westchester County. The Comptroller may assign any transfer
of tax lien made and delivered to the city upon payment of the amount
thereof with interest at the rate bid to the time of such assignment.
§ 183-7. Record of transfer of tax liens.
The Comptroller shall keep in his office a public record of sales of tax liens
and a copy of each transfer of such liens issued by him. Assignments of
transfer of tax liens duly acknowledged may be filed and recorded in the
office of the Comptroller. Transfer of tax liens and all assignments thereof
shall, upon request, be recorded by recording officers of Westchester
County in the same manner as mortgages and assignments thereof but
without the payment of a mortgage tax under the Tax Law. A transcript of
any record of a transfer of tax lien or assignment thereof in the office of the
Comptroller or any recording officer, duly certified, shall be evidence in any
court with like effect as the original instrument of record. Unless a contrary
intent appears, a tax or assessment lien shall be presumed to be satisfied
and discharged whenever it shall appear from recorded instruments that
the tax lien has been transferred or assigned to the owner of such lands or
tenements, notwithstanding other intervening estates or liens.
§ 183-6 TAX LIENS, DISPOSITION OF § 183-8
183:689
§ 183-8. Rights of purchaser of tax liens.
The aggregate amount of each tax lien transferred pursuant to this chapter
shall be due one year from the date of the sale. Until such aggregate amount
is fully paid and discharged, the holder of the transfer of tax lien shall be
entitled to receive interest on such aggregate amount from the day of sale,
semiannually on the first day of June and December, at the rate which the
purchaser shall have bid. At the option of the holder of any transfer of tax
lien, the aggregate amount thereof shall become due and payable after the
expiration of nine months from the date of sale either after default in the
payment of interest on such transfer of tax lien for three months and/or
after default for three months after the date of the sale of the tax lien in the
payment of any taxes or assessments which become a lien subsequent to
the taxes and assessments for which the tax lien so held is sold. The holder
of a tax lien may pay to the Comptroller, after default, the amount of any
subsequent taxes or assessments which have become a lien subsequent to
the taxes and/or assessments for which the lien so held was sold, and the
amount so paid shall bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the
date of such payment, and the amount so paid with interest may be added
to the aggregate amount of the tax lien upon foreclosure of the tax lien.
Upon the payment of such tax or assessment as aforesaid by the holder of
such a tax lien, the Comptroller shall note such payment with the name and
address of the holder of such tax lien on the tax record. The owner of the
property affected thereby shall have the right to repay such amount so paid
with interest at any time before the starting of an action to foreclose the
tax lien. In any instance where the city has bid in the tax lien and received
a transfer thereof, and the assessed value of the lot or parcel of land as
assessed upon any subsequent roll is less than $100, the Comptroller is
authorized to advance on behalf of the city the amount of any subsequent
tax or assessment, and in that event the tax lien for the amount of such tax
so paid shall not be sold, but the amount so paid with 12% interest from the
date of such payment shall be due and payable upon any redemption of the
transfer of the tax lien so held, or upon foreclosure thereof, as hereinafter
provided as a part of such tax lien.
§ 183-9. Payment of tax liens.
A. Any person having an interest as owner or mortgagee in the property
affected by a tax lien may satisfy or obtain an assignment of the same by
payment to the Comptroller of the city in the following manner:
(1) At any time prior to the service of notice to redeem, as hereinafter
provided, the payment shall consist of the principal amount due
and/or unpaid for or on account of such transfer of tax lien with
interest at the rate bid to 30 days after the date of payment, less
any payments made by any party on account thereof.
(2) The holder of the transfer of tax lien or any party to an action to
foreclose the same or any party in interest may give written notice
to the Comptroller of the city that notice to redeem has been served
or that an action to foreclose has been commenced, and upon
§ 183-8 RYE CODE § 183-9
183:690
receiving such written notice the said Comptroller shall require the
payment of the amounts hereinafter set forth.
(3) After the service of notice to redeem, as provided in § 183-13
hereof, if payment is made within the 30 days provided in said
notice, such payment shall consist of the amount set forth in the
notice to redeem, or if such payment is made after the expiration of
such 30 days but prior to the time that the Comptroller shall have
had notice of the commencement of a foreclosure thereof, attached
to a copy of the lis pendens with the date of filing in the County
Clerk's office endorsed thereon, the payment shall consist of the
amount unpaid and due on such transfer of tax lien with interest at
the rate bid for all unpaid interest thereon to 30 days after the date
of payment with disbursements as hereinafter set forth.
(4) After the Comptroller shall have had notice of the commencement
of an action to foreclose such transfer of tax lien and prior to
judgment of foreclosure, any person having an interest as owner or
mortgagee in the property affected by such tax lien may file in the
office of the Comptroller of the city a written notice of his intention
to redeem and shall pay to said Comptroller a sum equal to the
principal amount unpaid and due on such tax lien with interest at
the rate bid to 30 days after the date of payment. Such notice and
payment shall stay the proceedings in the foreclosure action except
as hereinafter provided. Upon receiving such notice and payment,
the Comptroller shall thereupon within five days give notice of such
filing and payment personally or by mail to the attorney for the
holder of such tax lien at the address appearing on the copy of lis
pendens filed with the lien; and therein direct that costs be taxed
by the clerk of the court in which the action is pending on five days'
written notice to the person filing notice of intention to redeem,
mailed to the address stated in such notice of intention. The bill of
costs shall not exceed $10 for costs, and disbursements actually
made or incurred not exceeding $25 for all authorized searches for
each tax parcel and postage paid in connection with the service of
notice to redeem and not exceeding $2 for each person served with
a summons, together with the other taxable disbursements,
including referee's fees, if any, actually paid or incurred to which
the plaintiff may be entitled and $5 for discontinuance, cancellation
and other services as hereinafter provided. Such bill of costs shall
also set forth the names and addresses of persons to whom said
disbursements were paid or are payable and the nature of each
item of disbursement. After said costs have been taxed by the clerk
of the court in which the action is pending, a certified copy thereof
shall be filed in the office of the Comptroller. If such certified copy
of bill of costs be filed with the Comptroller within 25 days after the
filing of such notice of intention to redeem and payment, the
transfer of tax lien, by the further payment to the Comptroller of
the amount of said bill of costs within said period of 30 days after
the filing of the notice of intention to redeem as above provided,
§ 183-9 TAX LIENS, DISPOSITION OF § 183-9
183:691
shall be discharged and satisfied of record or an assignment
thereof given. If no such certified copy of bill of costs be filed with
the Comptroller within said 25 days as above provided, the holder
of such transfer of tax lien shall immediately execute and deliver
to the party redeeming a duly acknowledged satisfaction or a duly
acknowledged assignment thereof. At the time of the delivery of
any satisfaction or assignment as provided in this subsection and
before the payment by the Comptroller of any sum to the holder of
the transfer of tax lien or to his attorney, such holder of the transfer
of tax lien shall cause to be delivered without any further payments
the original transfer of tax lien and any and all assignments thereof,
if any, also a consent to the discontinuance of the action and
a cancellation of the lis pendens without costs, also an affidavit
showing the parties served, the date of service and whether any
of them have appeared, attaching to the affidavit the original or a
copy of all notices of appearances and answers, if any. If payment
of costs is not made in the manner above provided, the stay of
proceedings shall be thereby vacated and the plaintiff authorized
to continue the action but shall give credit in the judgment of
foreclosure for all amounts paid as hereinafter provided.
(5) All payments made to the Comptroller as provided in this section
shall be received by him for the benefit of the holder of the tax lien
so paid, and he shall give notice thereof to said holder or a personal
representative or assignee by mail, addressed to such address that
may appear on the records of the Comptroller. The Comptroller
shall pay the amount of such payments so received to the person
who, according to the records of his office, appears to be entitled
thereto, or to the personal representative of such person, upon
such Comptroller's receiving a surrender of such transfer of tax
lien with assignment thereof, if any, together with a certificate of
cancellation or an assignment thereof as requested by the party
paying, and, in the event a foreclosure of such tax lien is pending, a
consent to the discontinuance of such action and the cancellation of
the lis pendens without costs. If a foreclosure action shall have
been pending at the time of payment and such payment shall have
been insufficient to discharge said transfer of tax lien as provided
in Subsection A(4) hereof, and shall so continue within the times
therein provided, the Comptroller shall pay the amount so received
by him to the person who, according to the records of his office,
appears to be entitled thereto or the personal representative of
such person. Any foreclosure of tax lien action may be ordered
discontinued, and any notice of pendency of such action ordered
canceled, by the court in which such action is pending upon proof
of the discharge of the tax lien being foreclosed in the manner
aforesaid.
B. Any person having an interest as owner or mortgagee in property
affected by a tax lien may pay the amount due on such tax lien directly
to the holder thereof. The amount payable shall be the same amount as
§ 183-9 RYE CODE § 183-9
183:692
§ 183-10. Apportionment of tax liens.
The City Assessor shall, at the written request of the owner, mortgagee
or prospective purchaser or mortgagee, apportion any transfer of tax lien
affecting property which is to be subdivided, or a part thereof sold or
mortgaged, or where two or more lots have been assessed together, and file
such apportionment with the Comptroller. The Comptroller shall, upon the
filing of such apportionment in his office, give written notice thereof by mail
to the holder of any transfer of tax lien so apportioned and also to all owners
or mortgagees as are shown in an affidavit to be filed by the applicant
for such apportionment. The applicant shall file with the Comptroller an
affidavit showing who are the owners of the property, with their names and
addresses, and also the names and addresses of all mortgagees holding
mortgages against the whole or any part of the property in reference to
which the transfer of tax lien is to be apportioned. The holder of any
such transfer of tax lien or any owner or mortgagee may, within 10 days
thereafter, given written notice to the Comptroller if he objects to the
apportionment and shall, within 10 days after filing written notice, proceed
to review by certiorari the action of the Assessor in making such
apportionment. In the event of the failure of the holder of any transfer
of tax lien or owner or mortgagee to file objections to the apportionment
within said 10 days, or, if he files objections, to proceed to review said
apportionment within 20 days, such apportionment shall be effective and
the Comptroller or the holder of any transfer of tax lien shall thereupon
accept payment of the amount so apportioned as affecting any part so
apportioned, and thereafter all provisions in this chapter contained in
reference to the payment of the transfer of tax lien or the foreclosure
thereof shall apply to the apportioned amounts.
§ 183-11. Discharge of tax liens.
A tax lien sold pursuant to the provisions of this chapter must be discharged
upon the record thereof by the Comptroller when payment is made to him
may be paid to the Comptroller of the city, and it shall be unlawful to
demand or receive a greater amount in payment of a transfer of tax lien
than that provided in Subsection A hereof. Upon making such payment,
such person shall be entitled to receive from the holder of such tax
lien the same documents as if such payment had been made to the
Comptroller, all as provided in Subsection A(4) hereof.
C. The record owner or holder of a transfer of tax lien shall, on request by
any person having a legal or beneficial interest in property affected by a
transfer of tax lien, furnish a statement of the balance due and unpaid
on account of any such lien, giving balance due on account of principal
and interest thereof, giving rate and date from which interest is
charged to date of statement.
D. The Comptroller shall furnish suggested forms for assignment and also
for satisfying transfer of tax liens.
§ 183-9 TAX LIENS, DISPOSITION OF § 183-11
183:693
of the amount due under the transfer of tax lien as provided in this chapter,
and also when the transfer of tax lien is surrendered to him for cancellation
and there is presented to him a certificate executed by the purchaser or
the personal representative or assignee of the purchaser, acknowledged
so as to be entitled to be recorded in Westchester County, certifying that
the tax lien has been paid or has been otherwise satisfied and discharged.
The transfer of tax lien thus surrendered and such certificate of discharge
must be filed by the Comptroller, and he must note upon the margin of the
record of such sale, upon such transfer of tax lien and upon the copy of
the transfer of tax lien kept in his office, a minute of such discharge and
the date of filing thereof. If the transfer of tax lien shall have been lost,
destroyed or mutilated and if payment of the amount due thereon be made
to the Comptroller, the said amount shall not be paid to the alleged holder
or owner of such transfer of tax lien except on an order of the court after
notice of application to the party or person paying such amount due and due
proof that such transfer of tax lien has been lost, destroyed or mutilated.
The filing of a certified copy of such order with the Comptroller shall be
taken in the place and stead of the transfer of tax lien so lost, destroyed or
mutilated. The Comptroller shall upon demand issue his certificate showing
the discharge of any tax lien which may have been duly discharged as
provided in this section, and such certificate may be filed in the office of the
Clerk of the County of Westchester, and said Clerk shall record the same
and, upon the margin of the record of such transfer of tax lien in his office,
shall note a statement that the same has been discharged, with reference to
the record of such certificate in his office.
§ 183-12. Exemption from taxation.
Tax liens and transfers of tax liens shall be exempt from taxation by the
state or any local subdivision thereof, except as to taxes imposed by Article
10 of the Tax Law. The real property affected by any tax lien shall not be
exempt from taxation by reason of this section.
§ 183-13. Foreclosure of tax liens.
A. If the amount of any tax lien which shall have been transferred by a
transfer of tax lien shall not be paid as provided in this chapter, or
redeemed after notice as provided in this chapter, when under the
terms and provisions of this chapter and of the transfer of tax lien such
amount shall be due, the holder of such tax lien may maintain an action
in the Supreme Court or in the County Court of Westchester County to
foreclose such tax lien. No action to foreclose a tax lien shall be
instituted hereunder unless the holder of such tax lien shall have served
notice to redeem upon the record owner or owners of the premises
affected by such tax lien, and also on the mortgagee or mortgagees
affected by such tax lien. Said notice to redeem shall require the
persons served to pay the amount due under such transfer of tax lien to
the Comptroller of the city or to the holder of such transfer of tax lien
within 30 days from the service of said notice, and shall set forth a
verified statement of the amount required for redemption, which shall
§ 183-11 RYE CODE § 183-13
183:694
consist of the amount due on account of such tax lien with interest at
the rate bid up to the date of the expiration of said thirty-day period,
together with disbursements actually made or incurred not exceeding
$25 for all authorized searches for each tax parcel and disbursements
for postage. The notice shall be served by registered mail addressed to
the last known address, if any, as shown by the records in the office
of the Comptroller and/or in the office of the Clerk of the County of
Westchester. In the event that such records fail to disclose the names
of such owners or mortgagees or fail to disclose the addresses of any
such owners or mortgagees, the Comptroller shall, at the request of
the owner of such transfer of tax lien or his or its representative, post
such notice in his office, and upon the expiration of 30 days from the
date of such posting, the transfer of tax lien holder shall have the same
rights as if the registered notice was given as herein provided. In an
action to foreclose a tax lien any person shall be a proper party of
whom the plaintiff alleges that such person has or may have or whom
the plaintiff has reason to believe that such person has or may have
an interest in or claim upon the real property affected by the tax lien.
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, an action to foreclose a
tax lien shall be regulated by the provisions of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules, including the right to the appointment of a receiver of rents
and profits pending such foreclosure proceedings as in the case of the
foreclosure of a mortgage, the same rules and laws applying, and by
all other provisions of law and rules of practice applicable to actions to
foreclose mortgages on real property. The people of the State of New
York may be made party to an action to foreclose a tax lien in the same
manner as a natural person. Where the people of the State of New York
or the city is made a party defendant, the complaint shall set forth, in
addition to the other matters required to be set forth by law, detailed
facts showing the particular nature of the interest in or the lien on the
said real property of the people of the State of New York or the city,
and detailed facts showing the particular nature of the interest in or the
lien on said real property which plaintiff has reason to believe that the
people of the State of New York or the city has or may have in the said
real property, and the reason for making the people of the State of New
York or the city a party defendant. Upon failure to state such facts, the
complaint shall be dismissed as to the people of the State of New York
or the city. Separate transfer of tax liens against the same lot or against
two or more lots or parcels of land may be foreclosed in one action.
In the event that any defendant to such an action desires to have the
action severed, an order to that effect may be granted upon due notice
to the plaintiff, and continued as to such defendant or defendants under
such conditions as the court may provide, or the complaint dismissed
as to such defendants, but without costs, or it may be severed on the
application of the plaintiff as to one or more defendants upon due
notice to such defendants as to which the severance is sought who have
appeared, but upon such conditions as the court may provide, or the
complaint dismissed as to such defendants but without costs.
§ 183-13 TAX LIENS, DISPOSITION OF § 183-13
183:695
§ 183-14. Pleading transfer of tax lien.
Whenever a cause of action, defense or counterclaim is for the foreclosure
of a tax lien or is in any manner founded upon a tax lien or a transfer of
a tax lien, the production in evidence of an instrument executed by the
Comptroller, in the form prescribed in § 183-6 hereof for a transfer of tax
lien subscribed by or in behalf of the Comptroller, shall be presumptive
evidence that the lien purported to be transferred by such an instrument
was a valid and enforceable lien and that it has been duly assigned to
the purchaser, and it shall not be necessary to plead or prove any act,
proceeding, notice or action preceding the delivery of such transfer of tax
lien nor to establish the validity of the tax lien transferred by such transfer
of tax lien. If a party or person in interest in any such action or proceeding
claims that a tax lien is irregular or invalid or that there is any defect
therein or that a transfer of tax lien is irregular, invalid or defective, such
invalidity, irregularity or defect must be specifically pleaded or set forth and
must be established affirmatively by the party or person pleading or setting
forth the same.
B. In any transfer of tax lien foreclosure brought by and on behalf of the
city where the property affected thereby has heretofore been sold for
any lien against the same and all back taxes and assessments due at the
time of such sale are not paid within 35 days after the date of such sale,
the city shall be entitled, on application to the court in which its action
is pending or any judge thereof, without notice, to the immediate
appointment of the City Comptroller as receiver of the rents and profits
of such property so affected by such lien, without bond or security, and
all fees received by him shall be paid into the city treasury.
C. A description of the property by block, lot or other description as shown
on the Tax Map, used in the tax rolls and shown in the transfer of tax
lien shall be sufficient for such foreclosure.
D. The referee or other official making the sale shall sell each transfer of
tax lien parcel separately, except that he may sell adjoining parcels with
a frontage of not to exceed 75 feet in width on the street front together,
but the court in and by the judgment may direct such other or different
method as may seem just and proper.
E. The referee or other official making the sale insert such additional
description in the deed as to him shall seem proper for convenience of
record identification.
F. The attorney for the plaintiff in the foreclosure of a transfer of tax lien
shall append to the notice of sale the approximate amount, including
penalties and interest, due for unpaid real property taxes and
assessments, including the amount due on the transfer of tax lien being
foreclosed, which are a lien against the premises so being sold.
§ 183-13 RYE CODE § 183-15
183:696
§ 183-15. Judgment upon tax lien.
In every action for the foreclosure of a tax lien and in every action or
proceeding in which a cause of action, defense or counterclaim is in any
manner founded upon a tax lien or transfer of tax lien, such transfer of tax
lien and the tax lien which it transfers shall be presumed to be regular and
valid and effectual to transfer to the purchaser named therein a valid and
enforceable tax lien. Unless in such an action or proceeding such tax lien
or transfer of tax lien is found to be invalid, they shall be adjudged to be
enforceable and valid for the amount thereof and the interest to which the
holder may be entitled, and to be a tax lien transferred by a transfer of tax
lien effectual to transfer such tax lien to the purchaser named therein.
§ 183-16. Judgment of foreclosure of tax lien.
A. In an action to foreclose a tax lien, unless the defendants obtain
judgment, the plaintiff shall be entitled to a judgment establishing the
validity of the tax lien so far as the same shall not be adjudged invalid,
and of the transfer of tax lien, and directing the sale of the real property
affected thereby or such part thereof as shall be sufficient to discharge
the tax lien or such items thereof as shall not be adjudged invalid and
the interest thereon and all other accrued taxes, assessments and water
rents affecting the real property, together with the expenses of the sale
and the costs of the action, except that the fees and/or allowances to a
referee or other official appointed to compute shall not exceed $10
unless there are five or more tax parcels in the action, in which event
the allowance shall not exceed $20, and the fee and/or allowance to the
referee or other official appointed to sell shall not exceed the rate
allowed to the referee appointed to compute. Costs in any foreclosure
action brought under the provisions of this chapter shall be in the
discretion of the court, but in no event shall such costs exceed the sum
of $20 unless there are five or more separate tax parcels included in
one action, in which event the costs shall not exceed $40. The award of
costs in any action shall carry with it the right to recover taxable
disbursements, together with such amount as the court shall allow for
authorized searches, not to exceed $10 for each tax parcel included in
the action. The judgment of foreclosure shall direct the payment of:
(1) The costs, disbursements and expenses of the foreclosure action.
(2) All taxes, assessments, tax liens and transfers of tax liens due and
owing to the Town of Rye, or shall provide that the tax parcel be
sold subject thereto, and if sold subject thereto, the notice of sale
shall state the approximate amount thereof, including penalties and
interest.
(3) All taxes and special district assessments, school taxes and
penalties payable to the Comptroller, and also all liens or transfers
of tax liens for same which are a lien against the premises so sold
subsequent to the taxes or assessments covered by the lien so
foreclosed, or shall provide that the tax parcel be sold subject
§ 183-15 TAX LIENS, DISPOSITION OF § 183-16
183:697
§ 183-17. Effect of judgment foreclosing tax lien.
thereto, and if sold subject thereto, the notice of sale shall state the
approximate amount thereof, including penalties and interest.
(4) All taxes and assessments, including school taxes or interest
acquired from the sale or lease of the premises for the same, which
are still unpaid and due and owing to the city, making the sale as of
the date of the taxes for which such tax lien has been sold, or shall
provide that the tax parcel be sold subject thereto, and if sold
subject thereto, the notice of sale shall state the approximate
amount thereof, including penalties and interest.
(5) The amount of the tax lien foreclosed with interest thereon.
B. In the event that the city is the plaintiff, the holder of any city tax lien
affecting the tax parcel sought to be sold shall be made a party to the
action, and such tax lien shall be sold free and clear of all city tax liens
and/or taxes due or owing to the city for state, county and city and
school taxes and special district assessments, and the proceeds of such
a sale after paying the costs and disbursements as herein provided shall
be applied to the cancellation of all such taxes and special district
assessments or tax liens therefor in the inverse order of the dates of the
liens of such taxes or assessments. The judgment of foreclosure and
sale shall also recite the transfer of the tax lien and each assignment
thereof, and unless such transfer of tax lien and each assignment
thereof has been duly recorded in the office of the County Clerk, the
same shall be attached to and form a part of the judgment.
C. In the event that the owners of one or more parcels are joined as
defendants, the judgment of foreclosure and sale shall provide for an
equitable division of the costs and disbursements as against each parcel
to be sold as in said judgment provided.
A. Every final judgment in an action to foreclose a tax lien shall be binding
upon, and every conveyance upon a sale pursuant thereto shall transfer
to and vest in the purchaser all the right, title, interest and estate in the
real property affected by such judgment of:
(1) The plaintiff.
(2) Each defendant upon whom the summons is served or who
appeared in the action either in person or by attorney.
(3) Each person claiming from, through or under such a defendant by
title accruing after the filing of notice of pendency of the action or
after the entry of the judgment and filing of the judgment roll in the
proper County Clerk's office.
(4) Each person not in being when the judgment is rendered, who
afterward may become entitled to a beneficial interest attaching to,
or an estate or interest in, such real property or any portion
§ 183-16 RYE CODE § 183-17
183:698
§ 183-18. Disposition of surplus.
Any surplus of proceeds of sale, after paying the expenses of sale and
the costs and disbursements, together with the payments as provided in
§ 183-16 hereof, must be paid into court for the use of the person or persons
entitled thereto, and the judgment shall provide that if such surplus remains
in court for a period of upwards of three months and no application has
been made therefor, the same shall be invested at interest for the benefit of
the person or persons entitled thereto, to be paid upon the direction of the
court.
§ 183-19. Disposition of real estate acquired by city.
The Comptroller is hereby authorized to sell any or all of the real property
acquired by the city upon the foreclosure of any tax or assessment lien or
the transfer of such lien, either at private sale or public auction, for the best
price that can be obtained. He shall not, however, sell the same at private
sale for a price less than the amount fixed and determined by a committee
consisting of the Comptroller, the Corporation Counsel and the Assessor,
which determination must be in writing, shall be approved by the Council
and shall be filed in the office of the Comptroller. The proceeds of the sale
of all such property shall be deposited to the credit of the miscellaneous
revenue of the city, subject to any interest therein or claim thereto by the
Towns of Rye and/or Harrison arising out of unpaid taxes on such property.
§ 183-20. Sale for less than amount of lien.
If at any time prior to the sale of real property in an action to foreclose
a transfer of tax lien held by the city, it shall be determined by the
Comptroller, the Corporation Counsel and the Assessor that the property is
not reasonably worth or will not sell for a price sufficient to pay all of the
thereof, provided that the person presumptively entitled to such
beneficial interest, estate or interest is a party to such action or
bound by such judgment.
B. In the event that the amount bid at such foreclosure sale is not
sufficient to pay the taxes, assessments, interest and penalties due the
city and the Town of Rye, then and in that event the final judgment shall
provide that the premises are sold subject to the lien of the same, after
deducting the amount actually paid on account thereof in connection
with such sale, but the City Council may after such sale direct that the
whole or any part of such taxes, interest and penalties be canceled if it
finds the total thereof exceeds the value of the property so sold. So
much of Section 317 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules as requires the
court to allow a defendant to defend an action after final judgment shall
not apply to an action to foreclose a tax lien. Delivery of the possession
of real property affected by a judgment to foreclose a tax lien may be
compelled in the manner prescribed in § 221 of the Real Property
Actions and Proceedings Law.
§ 183-17 TAX LIENS, DISPOSITION OF § 183-20
183:699
taxes, assessments and charges against the property and the expenses of
foreclosure and sale, they are hereby authorized and empowered, subject to
the approval of the Council, to fix a fair market price for the same, and the
Comptroller may, but shall not be obligated to, bid above the price so fixed,
and he hereby is further authorized and empowered to cancel all of the
taxes, assessments and charges against the same upon receiving payment
of the amount so fixed. The amount received from such sale shall be applied
in the manner provided for in the preceding section. The determination of
the Comptroller, the Corporation Counsel and the Assessor shall be stated
in writing, shall be approved by the Council and shall be filed in the office
of the Comptroller.
§ 183-21. Corporation Counsel to protect interest of city.
It shall be the duty of the Corporation Counsel to protect the interest of
the city in all matters, actions and proceedings relating to tax liens and
transfers of tax liens; to intervene on behalf of the city or of the holder of a
transfer of a tax lien in, or to make the city a party to, any action in which
he believes it to be to the interest to the city so to do, by reason of any
matter arising under or relating to any tax lien or transfer of tax lien, or
advertisement of sale of tax liens.
§ 183-22. Duplicate transfer of tax lien.
Whenever any transfer of tax lien given by the Comptroller as provided
in this chapter shall be lost, destroyed or mutilated, the holder or owner
thereof may apply to the court, on due proof of such loss, destruction or
mutilation, for an order directing the Comptroller to execute and deliver a
duplicate to such holder or owner. The filing of a certified copy of such order
with the Comptroller shall be taken in the place and stead of the transfer of
tax lien so lost, destroyed or mutilated.
§ 183-23. Other remedies not affected.
The remedy provided herein for the collection of taxes is in addition to the
other methods provided by law for the collection of taxes and assessments
in the City of Rye, including the procedure for the collection of delinquent
taxes under Article 11 of the Real Property Tax Law.

B.
A. The Council recognizes the United States Congress' intent in approving
the Cable Act (expressed in Section 601, codified at 47 U.S.C. § 521). As
such, the Council reaffirms and adopts those principles and ideals as
part of the city's intent with respect to cable television and expands its
intent (where applicable) to cover all MCS providers.
§ 185-5 RYE CODE § 185-6
185:710
B. As expressed by Congress and adopted by the Council, its intent is as
follows:
(1) To establish a local policy concerning communications and
technologies.
(2) To establish franchise procedures and standards which encourage
the growth and development of cable systems and which assure
that cable systems are responsive to the needs and interests of the
city.
(3) To establish guidelines for the exercise of local authority with
respect to the regulation of cable systems.
(4) To assure that cable communications provide, and are encouraged
to provide, the widest diversity of information and services to the
public.
(5) To establish an orderly process for franchise renewal which
protects franchisees against unfair denials of renewal where a
franchisee's past performance and proposal for future performance
meet the standards set by the Cable Act and this chapter.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
(6) To promote competition in cable communications and minimize
unnecessary regulation that would impose an undue economic
burden on cable systems.
C. In addition to the principles and ideals listed in Subsection B, the
Council also expresses that its intent covers the following:
(1) To create a set of regulations, standards and procedures for MCS
providers.
(2) To create a comprehensive customer service and consumer
protection policy for MCS providers.
(3) To provide for access and inspection of an MCS provider's books
and records in order to monitor compliance with local, state and
federal laws and any franchise agreement (if one has been
granted).
(4) To create a thorough construction and installation policy for an
MCS provider's system.
(5) To provide for the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the
city in light of the MCS provider's construction, operation and
maintenance of the system.
(6) To provide for the periodic inspection of an MCS provider's
facilities and equipment by the city or its designated agents.
§ 185-6 TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 185-6
185:711
§ 185-7. Designation of officer; delegation of powers and authority.
(7) To provide for emergency override capability, so that citizens of the
city may be warned of a potential, imminent or actual disaster or
emergency situation that exists in the area.
(8) To provide for the introduction and installation of safety alert
technology in order to notify both subscribers and nonsubscribers
of imminent disaster emergencies.
(9) To create a thorough procedure for collecting and monitoring
franchise fees and alternative user charges.
(10) To create a viable alternative to franchise fees in case such fees, or
their collection, are ruled invalid, unenforceable or
unconstitutional.
(11) To create a thorough default and revocation procedure for licensed
and franchised MCS providers.
(12) To provide for continuity of services in the event of city acquisition,
abandonment, withdrawal, cessation of service, revocation,
termination, nonrenewal or expiration of an MCS provider.
(13) To create a performance review procedure in order to assist the
city in its periodic evaluation of a franchised MCS provider's
performance.
D. Further, the Council recognizes that with respect to MCS providers
classified as "cable operators," the Council's power to adopt regulations
is, in part, authorized under Sections 632, 634 and 636 of the Cable Act
(codified at 47 U.S.C. §§ 552, 554 and 556, respectively) as well as the
Council's police powers, due to the potential for physical scarcity and
public disruption when cable either occupies or uses the public rightsof-
way.
E. With respect to the rules and regulations of the PSC, it is expressly
understood that such rules and regulations establish threshold
requirements that are to be met in order to operate a multichannel
system classified as a "cable system" within the city. Consequently, such
threshold rules and regulations of the PSC may be supplemented and/or
exceeded unless specifically preempted by the PSC or unless the extent
of the city's authority is determined otherwise by way of formal PSC
action. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
F. However, unless determined otherwise by the state or a court of
competent jurisdiction, the rules and regulations of the PSC are
applicable only to MCS providers classified as "cable operators." For all
such other MCS providers, the Council/franchising authority may
develop and implement its own set of rules and regulations, to the
extent permitted by both state and federal law. [Amended 5-29-1996
by L.L. No. 4-1996]
§ 185-6 RYE CODE § 185-7

§ 185-8. Applicability.
§ 185-9. Exemption.
A. Unless otherwise designated by the Council, the Council/franchising
authority is hereby designated the officer of the city who is responsible
for the continuing administration of this chapter. [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. Unless prohibited by federal or state law (including the PSC), the
Council/franchising authority may delegate its powers and authority
with respect to administering this chapter with regard to a franchise
agreement to a duly authorized official of the city. [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
C. However, the Council/franchising authority may never delegate its
franchising or revocation power to another person or representative.
A. Unless exempted entirely from this chapter or exempted under one (1)
or more provisions of this chapter or of a franchise agreement or
granted relief (by either the PSC or the Council/franchising authority)
from one (1) or more provisions and/or requirements of this chapter,
then this chapter shall be applicable to an MCS provider, and this
chapter shall have full effect and be enforceable in its entirety.
Moreover, an MCS provider shall be expected to comply with this
chapter no later than twelve (12) months after this chapter becomes
effective, except where a different compliance date is given or noted
(including a different date noted in an applicable franchise agreement).
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. Subsection A of this section is not intended to repeal, and does not have
the effect of repealing, any current franchise agreement that presently
exists between the Council/franchising authority and a franchised MCS
provider.
C. As a result of Subsection B of this section, the provisions of this chapter
shall have no effect on an existing franchise agreement until the
expiration of the existing franchise agreement or until the following
occurs:
(1) Prior to the expiration of the franchise agreement, the Council/
franchising authority and the affected franchised MCS provider
either execute an amended franchise or renewal franchise
agreement in which both parties agree to be bound by the terms of
this chapter (except as specifically granted relief, exemption,
clarification or comparable policy); or
(2) Both parties agree to a specific date for expiration of said existing
franchise, which in fact is prior to the present expiration date.
A. MCS providers which are exempted from complying with the provisions
of this chapter are as follows:
§ 185-7 TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 185-9
185:713
§ 185-10. Relief.
(1) An MCS provider who is exempted from this chapter as a result of
an applicable FCC or PSC ruling; or [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
(2) An MCS provider which is exempted from this chapter as a result of
an applicable judicial ruling, from which no subsequent appeal can
be taken.
B. It is expressly understood that an exempted MCS provider remains
exempted only as long as it meets one (1) or more of the specifications
of this particular section.
C. It also is expressly noted that the extent of the exemption for a qualified
MCS provider is only for this chapter. Consequently, such an exempted
MCS provider is expected to abide by and comply with any other
applicable city, state (including applicable PSC) or federal laws and
regulations, including any applicable federal or state consumer
protection or customer service laws and regulations. [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
A. Any MCS provider affected by this chapter may file a written petition at
any time with the Council/franchising authority seeking relief from one
(1) or more provisions of this chapter. The relief requested may
specifically include the exemption from or delay in implementation (as
to the petitioning MCS provider only) of one (1) or more provisions of
this chapter or that a specific provision be required for only part of any
franchise term. The position shall set forth the relief requested and the
basis thereof with such supporting information and material as may be
applicable.
B. In order to receive any relief from one (1) or more of the provisions of
this chapter, an MCS provider must satisfactorily demonstrate to the
Council/franchising authority that at least one (1) of the following facts
exists:
(1) The provision and/or requirement is expressly prohibited by federal
law, the FCC or state law or (where applicable) PSC rule or
regulation. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
(2) Where applicable, that the provision in question materially affects
and is in conflict with an expressed right that is specifically noted in
an existing franchise agreement (but only for the term of the
existing franchise) [this provision covers situations where an MCS
provider classified as a "cable operator" seeks and is granted
modification of an existing franchise agreement under Section 625
of the Cable Act (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 545)].
(3) That compliance with a particular provision and/or requirement
will be commercially impracticable for an MCS provider.
§ 185-9 RYE CODE § 185-10
185:714
§ 185-11. Compliance required.
An MCS provider shall not be excused from complying with any of the
requirements of this chapter or any subsequently adopted amendments
to this chapter by any failure of the Council/franchising authority on any
one (1) or more occasions to seek or insist upon compliance with such
requirements or provisions.
(4) That one (1) or more time frames listed in this chapter are either
impossible to meet or impractical to meet in light of the MCS
provider's operational policy.
(5) That the MCS provider has its own construction, maintenance,
operation or customer service policy which the Council/franchising
authority deems comparable to or exceeding any provision and/or
requirement from which the MCS provider seeks relief.
(6) That the health, safety and welfare interests of the city otherwise
warrant the granting of such relief.
C. Unless delegated to another authorized representative of the city, the
Council/franchising authority shall have the responsibility of
determining whether an MCS provider's construction, maintenance,
operation or customer service policy is comparable to or exceeds a
similar provision in this chapter.
D. As an alternative to seeking an exemption or requesting relief, an MCS
provider may petition for clarification on the precise intent and effect
that one (1) or more provisions or sections of this chapter have on the
petitioning MCS provider.
E. In accordance with this chapter, the Council/franchising authority may
charge the petitioning MCS provider with the actual costs for
processing such a petition, including any costs incurred by outside
consultants who are retained by the city to review an MCS provider's
petition, provided that the franchised MCS provider seeks a substantial
waiver of material provisions of this chapter previously understood to
be applicable to the franchisee and if such petition is deemed likely to
cause the city to incur additional and otherwise unnecessary costs not
previously anticipated in the determination of its franchise fee.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
F. In those instances where the Council/franchising authority grants an
exemption or relief to a franchised MCS provider or deems a franchised
MCS provider's operational policy to be comparable to a local law
provision, the franchise agreement (initial, existing or renewal) shall be
deemed amended to reflect the exact extent of such exemption and/or
relief. It should be specifically noted that the benefit of such exemption,
relief, clarification or comparable policy extends only to the MCS
provider granted such exemption, relief, clarification or comparable
policy. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]

and in effect within the city, including this chapter, to the extent that
said MCS provider or its predecessor in interest has not received an
exemption or relief from said local law(s), and to the extent that said
local laws do not materially conflict with the rights granted and
standards expressed in a franchise or franchise agreement between an
MCS provider and the city. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. Any MCS provider, its assignee or transferee shall be subject to, and
expected to comply with, all federal and state laws, and with all rules

where applicable, the FCC and PSC) now or hereafter in existence.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
C. Any MCS provider, its assignee or transferee shall be subject to all
lawful exercise of the city's police power.

of its administrative and legal rights in order to challenge the
constitutionality, applicability and enforceability of said future local
laws.
A. Except as noted in Subsection B of this section, to the extent that there
is any prior resolution, ordinance or local law which, in part or in whole,
is directly inconsistent with this chapter, such part or such whole of the
prior resolution or local law shall be repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency.
B. Subsection A of this section is not intended to repeal and does not have
the effect of repealing any current franchising ordinance or franchise
agreement that presently exists between the Council/franchising
authority and a franchised MCS provider.
A. In any case of an actual inconsistency between any provision or section
of this chapter and any provision or section of a federal or state rule,
regulation or law preemptive in nature and effect, then the preemptive
federal or state rule, regulation or law shall not only supersede the
effect of the local law, but also control in any local application.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. The above subsection specifically includes any situation wherein an
applicable federal or state judicial decision creates an actual
inconsistency with any provision or section of this chapter. In such a

§ 185-16. Arbitration.
If the Council/franchising authority and a franchised MCS provider agree
to such and the federal or state law does not expressly prohibit such, then
arbitration or settlement mediation may be used to resolve any dispute that
arises out of this chapter or franchise agreement. The terms and conditions
relating to the arbitration or settlement mediation process (including
possible cap on costs expended by both parties, composition of the hearing
panel and liability, if any, for the costs expended) shall be stated with
specificity in the franchise agreement; provided, however, that the parties
may agree, in writing, to such terms and conditions of the process prior to
the arbitration or settlement mediation.

situation, the federal or state judicial decision shall not only supersede
the effect of this chapter but also control in any local application.
A. Where there is a conflict (actual or apparent) between this chapter and
an existing and applicable franchise agreement, the local law shall
control and prevail unless administratively or judicially determined
invalid, unenforceable or unconstitutional or unless the provisions of
Subsection B of this section apply to the MCS provider and its franchise
agreement.
B. In the case where a franchised MCS provider receives an exemption,
relief, clarification from one (1) or more provisions or section of this
chapter or has one (1) or more of its policies deemed comparable to a
provision contained in this chapter, said franchisee's franchise
agreement shall be deemed to be amended to reflect the same such
exemption, relief, clarification or comparable policy, to whatever extent
may be necessary, and to the extent that such an exemption, relief,
clarification or comparable policy as contained in a franchise
agreement is inconsistent with a provision contained in this chapter,
then the specifically noted exemption, relief, clarification or comparable
policy language contained in the franchise agreement shall control.
A. Any franchisee or other MCS provider willfully violating or failing to
comply with any provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a civil
violation and upon conviction thereof be subject to a fine or other
penalty of not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.) as provided
for by state law. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a
separate violation and shall be subject to a separate fine or civil penalty.
A violation that consists of a single instance and which is promptly
corrected upon awareness or notification shall not be considered the

authority. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
equivalent of multiple violations for the period predating discovery and
notification.
B. In addition to any other penalties prescribed in this section, the city's
Corporation Counsel may maintain an action in a court of competent
jurisdiction to compel compliance with or restrain by injunction any
violations of the provisions of this chapter. Each day upon which there
exists a violation of this chapter or a failure to abide by or comply with
any provision or requirement of this law after due notice and an
opportunity to cure the violation has been afforded the MCS provider
shall constitute a separate occurrence and may subject the MCS
provider to separate penalties.
C. In instances where a franchise agreement provides for assessed
charges or liquidated damages for the breach or violation of that
franchise agreement, then such assessed charges or liquidated
damages shall be considered controlling and an adequate alternative to
the remedies described in this law. Such assessed charges or liquidated
damages shall not be used by the city until after it first attempts to
resolve the matter in the manner prescribed by this chapter.
A. Subject to preemption by, or other approval authority of, the FCC or any
other federal or state governmental entity or agency (including, where
applicable, the PSC), and to the extent permitted by any applicable law,
the Council/franchising authority retains the authority to provide for:
(1) The regulation and control of any multichannel system within the
geographical limits of city.
(2) The award and grant of an MCS franchise (where required)
subsequent to review of an application or proposal by the Council/
franchising authority.
(3) The periodic review and/or amendment or repeal of all or part of
this chapter; except as it may not unilaterally impose substantial
capital requirements not anticipated in the franchise agreement.
(4) If mutually agreed to with a franchised MCS provider, the periodic
review and/or amendment of any existing franchise agreement.
B. The Council/franchising authority, to the extent permitted by Section
623 or other provisions of the Cable Act (codified at 47 USC § 543),
retains the power to approve the rates or charges associated with the
providing of multichannel service classified as "cable service" by an
MCS provider classified as a "cable operator."

any other federal or state governmental entity or agency (including in
certain instances, the PSC), the Council/franchising authority retains
the jurisdiction to enforce all laws and regulations relating to
multichannel customer service practices and consumer protection.
D. If the FCC, Congress, the State, PSC or other governmental agency
with authority over cable or any other MCS provider ever abrogates,
deletes, removes or otherwise disposes of rules or standards that are
referenced in this chapter or relied upon by the Council/franchising
authority for purposes of MCS provider compliance with this chapter,
then the Council/franchising authority may, to the extent not preempted
by or inconsistent with later-adopted law or regulations, reinstate such
rules or standards. In such case, the reinstated rules will have the same
weight (as allowed under prevailing law) as they had prior to their
initial deletion.
A. Both the Council/franchising authority and each MCS provider shall
provide the other party with the name and address of the contact
designated to receive notices, filings, reports, records, documents and
other correspondence. All notices affecting the rights of such parties
shall be delivered to each party's contact by certified mail, return
receipt requested, personal service with a signed receipt of delivery or
overnight with receipt verification, unless otherwise provided in an
applicable franchise agreement. All other filings, reports, records,
documents and other correspondence may be delivered by any
permissible means including, but not limited to: facsimile transmission
("faxing"); personal service; overnight mail or package delivery or
delivery via cable. The delivery of all notices, reports, records and other
correspondence shall be deemed to have occurred at the time of receipt
(unless otherwise designated by state law or PSC rule or regulation).
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. If the MCS provider is required to maintain a franchise, then the
designation of such contact person for notice purposes may be
contained within a franchise agreement.

§ 185-27. Liability insurance. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
A. To the extent permitted by law, an MCS provider shall, as a condition of
the exercise of its rights to use the city's streets or ways, be required to
at all times defend, indemnify, protect, save harmless and exempt the
city, the City Manager, the Council/franchising authority, their officers,
agents, servants and employees from any and all, penalty, damage or
charges arising out of claims, suits, demands, causes of action or award
of damages, whether compensatory or punitive, or expenses arising
therefrom, either at law or in equity, which might be claimed now or in
the future, which may arise out of or be caused by the construction,
erection, location, products performance, operation, maintenance,
repair, installation, replacement, removal or restoration of the
multichannel system within the city by a negligent act or omission of an
MCS provider, its agents or employees, contractors, subcontractors,
independent contractors or implied or authorized representatives. With
respect to the penalties, damages or charges referenced herein,
reasonable attorneys' fees, consultants' fees and expert witness fees
are included as those costs which may be recovered by the Council/
franchising authority. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. The city, City Manager and the Council/franchising authority
specifically reserve the right to retain counsel of their own choice, at
their own expense.60
C. Neither the city, the City Manager nor the Council/franchising authority
shall unreasonably withhold its approval of counsel.
D. With respect to an MCS provider's own defense of such actions noted in
this section, it is understood that such MCS provider reserves the right
to select and retain, without the Council/franchising authority's
approval, counsel of the MCS provider's choice, at such MCS provider's
expense.
E. It is specifically intended that the obligation to indemnify the city, the
City Manager, the Council/franchising authority and their officers,
agents, servants and employees shall not be limited to the MCS
provider operating under authority of this chapter but shall include any
parent of the MCS provider.
A. An MCS provider shall secure and maintain, for as long as it provides
multichannel service to subscribers, liability insurances in at least the
following amounts, each inclusive of annual aggregate:
(1) Commercial general liability: one million dollars ($1,000,000.)
combined single limit per occurrence for personal injury or death
and/or property damage.
60.Editor's Note: Former Subsection C, which dealt with obtaining and approving counsel,
was repealed 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996. This local law also renumbered former
Subsections D, E and F as C, D and E.

(2) Automobile liability: one million dollars ($1,000,000.) combined
single limit per accident.
(3) Umbrella liability: five million dollars ($5,000,000.).
B. An MCS provider's public and personal liability insurance policy shall
specifically include the city, the City Manager and the Council/
franchising authority as additional insureds.
C. The public and personal liability and property damage insurance policy
shall be issued by an agent or representative of an insurance company
licensed to do business in the state.
D. The public liability and property damage insurance policy shall contain
an endorsement obligating the insurance company to furnish the
Council/franchising authority with at least thirty (30) days' written
notice in advance of the cancellation of the insurance.
E. Renewal or replacement policies or certificates shall be delivered to the
Council/franchising authority before the expiration of the insurance
which such policies are to renew or replace.
F. Before a multichannel system provides multichannel service to
subscribers, the MCS provider shall deliver the policies or certificates
representing the insurance to the Council/franchising authority.
G. If the Council, state or PSC permits an MCS provider to self-insure or to
provide other evidence of adequate security of its obligations, then the
MCS provider may exercise its right to self-insure, so as long as the
minimal amounts of insurance coverage outlined in this section or
similar levels of security are met and maintained for the entire period
that the affected MCS provider is self-insured.
A. An MCS provider shall furnish to the Council/franchising authority, in
an amount totaling at least one million dollars ($1,000,000.), a
performance bond or security bond executed by a surety licensed to do
business in this state and acceptable to the Council/franchising
authority, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. The purpose
of the performance bond is to ensure performance of any requirements
imposed by this chapter on an MCS provider. Further, the purpose is to
guarantee that should the MCS provider not fulfill any obligations
imposed by this chapter (or, where applicable, a franchise agreement),
then the surety will make whole (to the extent of the policy) any
monetary losses incurred by the city.
B. Unless an alternative form of financial guarantee or security is
accepted by the Council, an MCS provider shall furnish to the Council/
franchising authority, a construction/completion bond prior to the time
it commences a construction, upgrade, rebuild or repair/maintenance
project required by its franchise or license that has a capital
§ 185-27 TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 185-28
185:721
§ 185-29. Records and reports.
construction cost or outlay exceeding one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000.) in value. The amount of the bond shall equal ten thousand
dollars ($10,000.). The construction/completion bond shall remain in
force at all times until the subject construction is complete, unless relief
is granted or a reduction schedule is detailed in an agreement between
the Council/franchising authority and the MCS provider. [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
C. The construction/completion bond or security bond shall specifically
guarantee that an MCS provider will timely abide by its required
construction, upgrade, rebuild, or repair/maintenance schedule for the
multichannel system and/or any timetable for technical and service
improvements or additions to the multichannel system as may be
committed to, or agreed upon, from time to time, by the Council/
franchising authority and MCS provider. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
D. If the city draws on a performance or completion bond or cash deposit
or other guarantee as a result of an MCS provider's failure to timely
discharge its obligations or failure to construct and activate the
multichannel system or failure to complete a multichannel system
upgrade or rebuild or repair/maintenance, then the MCS provider shall
be required, within thirty (30) days, to replenish the completion and
performance bond or security bond, or guarantee, to the minimal level
required by the Council/franchising authority. [Amended 5-29-1996
by L.L. No. 4-1996]
E. Should the Council/franchising authority make a formal determination
that due to the MCS provider's past performance (such as a
documented history of repeated or multiple franchise violations) or
increased cost [greater than fifty percent (50%) of the original
estimated cost], the Council/franchising authority (unless preempted by
either the state or PSC) may raise the required amount of either the
performance or the construction/completion bond. [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
F. The performance bond or security bond shall be in force at all times
unless relief is granted or a reduction schedule is detailed in a separate
agreement, executed between the MCS provider and the Council/
franchising authority. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
A. The Council/franchising authority recognizes that advances in
technology and the adoption and application of multichannel laws,
rules, regulations and court decisions may have a profound effect and
impact on an MCS provider in any given year.
B. Consequently, it is incumbent that the Council/franchising authority
take measures to reduce the risk that multichannel service or the
multichannel system will be adversely affected in any given year.

C. Therefore, the evaluation of legal, technical, financial, character
qualifications and practices related to customer service and consumer
protection of an MCS provider is viewed as a continuing undertaking on
the part of the city. Each MCS provider shall maintain and retain all
records and reports necessary for the Council/franchising authority to
determine compliance with the obligations imposed on it by this
chapter and to determine the MCS provider's (legal, technical, financial
and character) qualifications.
A. Within ninety (90) days after this chapter becomes effective or the
grant of a franchise or license pursuant hereto, an MCS provider shall
submit a list to the Council/franchising authority or designee of the
principal files, reports, records, data or other information that the MCS
provider periodically files with the FCC or another federal or state
agency. As part of a performance evaluation or for any legitimate
matter related to the administration of an MCS provider agreement, the
Council/franchising authority may specifically request that it be
provided with any of the pertinent reports, records, data or other
information that were originally filed with the FCC or another federal or
state agency (including the PSC). However, unless specifically
authorized by the state, an MCS provider shall not be required to
provide to the Council/franchising authority any state or federal tax
returns or any documents (inclusive of all above-referenced categories)
exempted under state or federal privacy laws, including Section 631 of
the Cable Act (codified at 47 USC § 551). [Amended 5-29-1996 by
L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. In addition to the requirements noted in Subsection A of this section, an
MCS provider shall timely submit those reports, statements and logs
required by this chapter, including but not limited to the following:
(1) A periodic gross revenue statement in the manner set forth in this
chapter.
(2) A periodic certification that answering of phones is meeting the
specifications listed in this chapter.
(3) The satisfactory resolution of problems and complaints in the
manner set forth in this chapter.
(4) Preventive maintenance reports in the manner set forth in this
chapter.
(5) Any other reports or information required by another section of this
chapter or by the Council/franchising authority which is necessary
to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.
(6) If required, an annual registration and compliance statement.

A. An MCS provider shall keep complete and accurate books of its
pertinent accounts and records of the business and operations under
and in connection with the MCS system, including records of its
telephone responses. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. The Council/franchising authority shall have the right to be provided for
review (either by mail or at the MCS provider's local office) all pertinent
records (needed for the administration and enforcement of this chapter
and/or franchise agreement) on seven (7) days' written notice, unless
specifically exempted by the Council/franchising authority. Such review,
unless mutually agreed upon or judicially ordered, should occur within
the MCS provider's regular office hours. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
C. The Council/franchising authority shall have the right to hire, at its own
expense, an independent certified public accountant or other business
or financial expert to review the books and records of an MCS provider.
If after a financial audit it is determined that the MCS provider has
underpaid amounts owed to the city by five thousand dollars ($5,000.)
or greater amount, then the city may require the MCS provider to
reimburse the city for the actual cost of the audit. Absent fraud, any
audit that is agreed to by subject parties shall be binding on all parties
concerned. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
D. A false entry into the books and/or records of an MCS provider, made by
an MCS provider, of a material and substantial fact shall constitute a
material violation of this chapter. However, an erroneous entry, made in
good faith, shall not constitute a material violation of this chapter.
E. An MCS provider shall keep complete and accurate books and records
of the pertinent aspects of the multichannel system's operation for at
least the preceding three (3) years in such a manner that all matters
pertaining to the city can be easily produced and/or verified at the city's
request. Also, the MCS provider shall keep and shall make available and
provide upon request any other applicable records and information that
may be required by any other federal or state agency (including PSC)
having jurisdiction over one (1) or more classes of MCS providers.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
A. Within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date that this chapter
becomes effective, the city shall develop a registration and compliance

In addition to any and all requirements of this chapter, each and every
MCS provider shall comply with and abide by all applicable provisions of
any state law concerning consumer sales practices (and including, where
applicable, consumer protection rules and regulations of the PSC).
§ 185-38. Provider responsibilities; notice to customer.

a franchisee and is not subject to the periodic performance evaluation
detailed elsewhere in this chapter. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
B. The Council/franchising authority declares as its purpose that the
registration and compliance statement is intended to furnish the
Council/franchising authority with periodic operational and compliance
information concerning MCS providers operating within all or part of
the city who are not otherwise subject to a periodic performance
evaluation and are not franchisees. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
C. Prior to January 15 of each calendar year, the Council/franchising
authority shall furnish each such affected MCS provider a registration
and compliance statement. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
D. Prior to March 1 of each calendar year, the affected nonfranchised MCS
provider shall return to the Council/franchising authority a completed
and executed compliance statement. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
E. There shall be no charge or fee associated with returning the annual
registration and compliance statement. However, if the MCS provider
supplies incomplete information which requires independent
verification by the city (including a consultant hired by the city), then
the MCS provider may be required to reimburse the city for all costs
associated with the independent verification. Moreover, failure to
submit a statement by the deadline or the submission of false
information (of a material nature) within the statement may subject the
affected MCS provider to any and all penalties listed in this chapter.
However, before subjecting an MCS provider to potential penalties, the
Council/franchising authority must first allow the affected MCS
provider the opportunity to cure and/or to correct the incorrect nature
of the submission or cure the item of alleged noncompliance.
A. The Council/franchising authority recognizes that it is critical that a
customer of an MCS provider fully understand and realize the rights
and responsibilities of both the customer and MCS provider with
§ 185-36 TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 185-38
185:725
§ 185-39. Notification.
respect to the provision, maintenance and repair of multichannel
service.
B. Further, the Council/franchising authority believes that if sufficient,
timely and easily understood information is provided to a customer on
certain customer service practices such as rates, billing periods,
number and types of services provided and rules concerning equipment
use and return, then that customer will have the information necessary
to make an informed decision on what, if any, multichannel services to
subscribe to and receive.
C. In order to provide customers with the variety of information needed to
make an informed decision and to ensure that customers are notified of
their and the MCS provider's rights and responsibilities with respect to
the multichannel system, an MCS provider must provide a customer
with a written Notice of a Customer's and MCS Provider's Rights and
Responsibilities With Respect to the Provision of Multichannel Service
or the effective equivalent thereof. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
D. The Notice of a Customer's and MCS Provider's Rights and
Responsibilities With Respect to the Provision of Multichannel Service
shall be provided at the time of initial installation. Thereafter, a
subscriber shall be provided with a written notice at least once every
twelve (12) months. If, however, an MCS provider amends, repeals,
adds, deletes, modifies or makes other changes to any customer service
practice that is required in this chapter, then said MCS provider shall
provide a subscriber with such written notification with no more than
thirty (30) days following the effective date of such amendment, repeal,
addition, deletion, modification or other change, unless earlier notice is
required by applicable federal or state law or rules. An MCS provider
will use its best efforts to provide written notice thirty (30) days prior to
effective date. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
E. Unless expressly prohibited by the state or PSC, an MCS provider may
comply with the notice requirements by providing said notice over the
MCS system on a channel clearly designated for the dissemination of
such information (such a channel need not be solely designated for
dissemination of such information and may, in fact, be used at other
times for any lawful purpose). [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
F. If the notice in Subsection E preceding is provided over the MCS
system on a channel clearly designated for the dissemination of such
information, such notice shall be cablecast at least once hourly, twentyfour
(24) hours a day, for thirty (30) consecutive days.
A. At the time an MCS provider is required to furnish an initial or annual
notice, such notice shall contain, at a minimum, the following:
§ 185-38 RYE CODE § 185-39
185:726
(1) A timely listing of the specific multichannel services provided,
clearly indicating and isolating the basic, premium and
informational services offered, as well as the service tiers or

(2) Notification of a subscriber's ability to purchase or lease from the
MCS provider a lock box, parental control mechanism or other
device which will prohibit the viewing of a particular multichannel
service during a period selected by the subscriber.61
(3) A comprehensive listing and explanation of all rates and charges
(including rates for basic and premium channels/services,
particular service tiers or service clusters, generally applicable
discount or promotional fees, installation charges and security
deposits, if any, but excepting pay-per-view single event prices).
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
(4) If service clustering is available, then a description and explanation
of any penalties, credits, restrictions, upcoming service clustering
changes or differing alignments or other pertinent information.
(5) A comprehensive listing and explanation of all billing options
available (such as monthly, quarterly or yearly and/or discounts for
prepayments).
(6) The customer service office hours and telephone number(s) in a
manner consistent with the specific policy set forth in this chapter.
(7) The billing practices of an MCS provider in a manner consistent
with the specific policy set forth in this chapter.
(8) The specific customer complaint/inquiry resolution policy that is
adopted and followed by an MCS provider and which is consistent
with the parameters set forth in this chapter.
(9) The method of securing a voluntary disconnection in a manner
consistent with the specific policy set forth in this chapter.
(10) Rules relating to both connections and involuntary disconnections.
(11) The extent of the credit/refund policy in a manner consistent with
the specific policy set forth in this chapter.
(12) The equipment use and return policy, together with any required

C. The notice may be delivered to the subscriber via an insert in the
subscriber's periodic invoice or through a special mailing or over an
MCS channel clearly designated for the dissemination of such
information or by hand delivery, provided that a receipt is executed by
the subscriber.
D. If the MCS provider chooses to avail itself of the opportunity to provide
the notice over the MCS system, on a channel clearly designated for the
dissemination of such information, such notice shall be cablecast
continuously, at least once hourly, twenty-four (24) hours a day, for
thirty (30) consecutive days. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
A. Within the notice that is required by this chapter, subscribers shall be
informed of at least the following billing practices of an MCS provider:
(1) Billing procedures (including payments necessary to avoid
discontinuance of service).
(2) Payment due and delinquent dates.
(3) Amount or percentage of late charges, if any.
(4) Advance billing options.
(5) Resolution procedures for billing disputes, complaints and
inquiries.
(6) Refund/credit policy for service interruptions or uncontracted
service.
(7) Current service rates in a detailed and understandable format.
(8) Procedure and amount of charges for installation or relocation of
an MCS provider's facilities and/or equipment.
(9) Current schedule and explanation for any billed charges or other
non-regularly occurring fees invoiced to subscribers, including but

L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. Any information concerning billing practices which is contained in the
notice shall be consistent with and include any matter specified by PSC
rules and regulations. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-199662]
C. Existing subscribers shall be informed of the items listed in Subsection
A of this section at least once every twelve (12) months. [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
D. Whenever there is a change in an MCS provider's billing practices or
payment requirements, all subscribers must be notified in writing by no
later than thirty (30) days after such billing practices or payment
requirements become effective, unless earlier notice is required by
applicable federal or state law or rules. MCS provider will use its best
efforts to provide written notice thirty (30) days prior to the effective
date of such change. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
E. Pursuant to PSC regulations, in any case where a subscriber requests a
cancellation or reduction of service within thirty (30) days after the
notification of a scheduled rate or charge adjustment, then the
subscriber's liability for such service received during the thirty (30)
days following the date of notice until the cancellation or reduction of
service shall be determined in accordance with the rates or charges in
effect prior to such change. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
A. An MCS provider shall adhere to and comply with applicable state laws
and regulations, including those of the PSC, with respect to service
outages or interruptions.
B. Consistent with Subsection A of this section and to the extent permitted
by either state law or PSC rule and regulation, then the Council/
franchising authority requires that an MCS provider (not covered by
preemptive state law or PSC rules and regulations) automatically
(without a separate request from the subscriber) provide a subscriber
with credit for a service outage or interruption or loss of any signal or
service exceeding four (4) hours in length whenever such MCS provider
may reasonably be expected to be able to determine the existence of the
outage and the extent of such outage. For a service outage or
interruption of a pay-per-view event that exceeds more than one-fourth
(1/4) of the scheduled or projected length of the pay-per-view event, or
four (4) hours (whichever is shorter), then the MCS provider must
provide a subscriber with a credit for the full amount of the pay-perview
event; provided, however, that such credit shall not exceed the
62.Editor's Note: Former Subsection C, which immediately followed this subsection and dealt
with periodic service bills, was repealed 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996. This local law also
renumbered former Subsections D, E and F, as C, D and E, respectively.

cost of one (1) full day of such pay-per-view event programming for an
outage that does not exceed twenty-four (24) hours.
C. To the extent permitted by the rules of the FCC or by the state or PSC,
the Council/franchising authority may prescribe rules for giving credit
to a subscriber in cases where a substandard signal or substandard
picture quality is furnished by the MCS provider. Substandard signal or
picture quality being a signal not delivered with the quality or lack of
degradation reasonably able to be provided given the performance
capabilities of the receiving and distribution equipment of the system.
D. In the case of a charge for unsolicited service, an MCS provider shall, to
the extent required by applicable federal and state law or rules, provide
a subscriber with an adjustment or billing credit on the next available
billing statement. Moreover, in such a case, an MCS provider shall not
consider a subscriber delinquent for failure to pay a charge for
unsolicited service. This is not intended to prevent an MCS operator
from adding new programming services so long as there is no increased
cost to the subscriber.
A. The Council/franchising authority both recognizes and determines that
as a matter of consumer protection a subscriber should be charged only
for those services that such subscriber has affirmatively requested.
Therefore, an MCS provider may not bill or invoice any subscriber for
any multichannel service that is not affirmatively requested by the
subscriber.
B. For purposes of this section, a subscriber's affirmative request need not
be in writing, but an MCS provider relying on an oral request must keep
an accurate record of the date when the request was made. [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
C. For purposes of this section, a subscriber shall be deemed to have
affirmatively requested a multichannel service if:
(1) The subscriber voluntarily makes payment for the multichannel
service after an initial free trial period.
(2) There was included in the notice or advertising material describing
the service as well as on the first periodic invoice after the service
was instituted a statement clearly advising the subscriber that such
subscriber has incurred no obligation to pay for such service and
that such subscriber need not take any action to avoid incurring
any such obligation.
D. Moreover, an MCS provider may not automatically enroll a subscriber
into a different class or tier of multichannel service, including any or all
equipment needed, without first promptly informing such subscriber of
any and all costs associated with such a different class or tier of
§ 185-41 RYE CODE § 185-42

service tiers.
multichannel service or equipment. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
E. Additionally, an MCS provider may not invoice a subscriber for
disconnecting or downgrading from a negatively promoted or
automatically enrolled class or tier of multichannel service.
F. Should a subscriber be charged for a multichannel service in violation
of this section, then the MCS provider shall provide a subscriber with
an adjustment or billing credit on the next available billing statement.
Moreover, in such case, an MCS provider shall not consider a
subscriber delinquent for failure to pay a charge for a non-affirmatively
requested multichannel service.
G. If the PSC adopts rules and regulations concerning this practice, then
those rules and regulations should control and be operative with
respect to an MCS provider classified as a "cable operator." [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
A. The Council/franchising authority recognizes that the concept of menudriven
program/service selection has both positive and negative
aspects. On the one hand, menu-driven program/service selection
allows the greatest flexibility for a subscriber in that it permits the
subscriber to essentially create a program/service package tailored to
the subscriber's budget, viewing habits and informational needs. On the
other hand, menu-driven program/service selection is susceptible to
unauthorized or unknowing purchases and uninformed program
choices if certain procedural and operational safeguards are not
maintained.
B. Should an MCS provider implement and/or offer menu-driven program/
service selection for all or the majority of the MCS provider's
multichannel services, then the Council/franchising authority reserves
the power to adopt (consistent with any applicable PSC rules and
regulations) additional rules and regulations (subject to the conditions
listed in Subsection C of this section) concerning the following potential
problem areas: [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
(1) Notification to the subscriber [on a periodic (at least annual) basis]
of the costs for each menu-driven program/service, including any
installation or equipment rental charges, but this is not intended to
include single-event pay-per-view programming.
(2) Notification of what constitutes or what is required for selection or
subscription to a particular program/service.
(3) Limitations on negative option marketing plans when done in
connection with a menu-driven system unless the subscriber
provides written consent to be included on a list of potential

subscribers and is informed initially and periodically thereafter (at
least annually) of the right to refuse such consent.
(4) Restricting access to menu-driven program/service selection by
subscribers (through the use of individual, nonduplicative access
codes or some other means), in order to limit unauthorized
purchases or purchases above a certain preset amount.
C. If at the time an MCS provider implements and/or offers menu-driven
program/service selection such MCS provider also adopts an
operational policy which protects subscribers from those potential
problem areas listed in Subsection B of this section, then the Council/
franchising authority shall not exercise its additional regulatory
authority on this subject, unless there is documentation that the
adopted policy of the MCS provider is not being enforced or is
ineffective in safeguarding subscribers from the potential abuses listed
above.63
D. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as mandating any
particular programming choice being provided to a subscriber. Nor
should this section be construed as requiring any particular program,
service, cluster or tier. Rather, this section is designed to promote
cluster and tier stability, so that a subscriber may choose a program,
service, cluster or tier that best suits the subscriber's individual
programming and informational needs.
A. In order to facilitate the needs of the local customers, an MCS provider
shall maintain a customer service office which is both within reasonable
proximity to the city and easily accessible to customers. [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. The customer service office shall be open at least forty (40) hours per
week (exclusive of holidays).
C. Within the forty (40) hours per week that a customer service office must
be open, an MCS provider must provide office hours either on at least
two (2) evenings (after 5:00 p.m.), or on Saturdays and/or Sundays (if
not prohibited by state law, including PSC rules and regulations).
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
D. The customer service office should have an adequate and
knowledgeable staff in order to handle the vast majority of customer
service inquiries, specifically including, but not limited to, billing
inquiries, refunds, credit, service outages, equipment service and
repair, payment of bills and other charges and inquiries from disabled
or physically impaired customers.
63.Editor's Note: Former Subsection D, which immediately followed this subsection and dealt
with service clusters and the packaging of service tiers, was repealed 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996. This local law also renumbered former Subsection E as Subsection D.
§ 185-43 RYE CODE § 185-44
185:732
E. An MCS provider may install (at its customer service office) an afterhours
depository in order to collect invoice payments and receive
requests for service appointments (including connections and
disconnections) after scheduled office hours.
F. An MCS provider may install an automated (audio or video) customer
assistance device or machine which can handle various types of
customer inquiries, so long as the caller has the option and ability to
speak with a live representative of the MCS provider during the hours
that the office is open and service calls are performed, pursuant to the
requirements of this chapter.
G. Where not prohibited by the state (including PSC rules and
regulations), an MCS provider may install an interactive customer
assistance service over one (1) or more multichannels which can handle
various types of customer inquiries. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
H. Neither the presence of an after hours depository nor automated
customer service device nor interactive customer service channel
relieves an MCS provider from maintaining the minimal required
number of office hours or adequate staff of customer service
representatives to handle the service inquiries [unless the MCS
provider can demonstrate to the Council/franchising authority's
satisfaction that the efficiency of such devices or service channel(s)
reduces the need for customer service hours or customer service staff].
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
I. Any MCS provider shall be able to certify to the Council/franchising
authority that each customer service representative (CSR) has taken
and passed an MCS provider-implemented course designed to train
customer service representatives to handle their jobs in a courteous,
efficient and responsive manner. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
J. An MCS provider shall maintain at least one (1) toll-free and/or local
telephone number to accommodate normal business inquiries.
K. An MCS provider shall maintain a twenty-four-hour toll-free and/or
local telephone number to facilitate calls concerning repair of
equipment and extended interruption of service. During any hours that
the customer service office is open, the MCS provider must have, or
make available, in-house personnel to address a customer's inquiries.
During other hours, the franchisee's service telephone lines may be
manned by remotely located staff or by an automatic answering device.
Incoming calls are to be monitored at all times to determine the
existence of any service outages and to facilitate the franchisee's
prompt response to such outages consistent with all applicable
standards of this chapter or federal or state rules. Three (3) or more
related service outage calls from the same area will receive immediate
attention. The MCS provider shall not be required to make in-person

§ 185-45. Special service requirements. [Amended 5-29-1996 by
L.L. No. 4-1996]
Notwithstanding any other requirements mandated by this chapter or by
federal or state law (including PSC rules and regulations), an MCS provider
shall comply with the following special service requirements for blind,
hearing-impaired or ambulatory-impaired customers. The MCS provider
shall:
§ 185-46. Preferential or discriminatory practices prohibited.
telephone contacts to subscribers at a rate which exceeds sixty (60)
calls per hour. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
L. An MCS provider shall have adequate staff and/or extension lines
(except during special marketing promotion periods, peak billing cycles
and service outages) in order to handle calls and inquiries directed to
the general information number so that the following standards may be
met at least ninety percent (90%) of the time as measured on a
quarterly basis under normal operating conditions: [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
(1) Ninety-five percent (95%) of all customer calls received in a year
shall be attended within three (3) minutes by a representative of
the MCS provider or by a device that is capable of complaint/
inquiry resolution.
(2) All customer calls shall be answered properly within thirty (30)
seconds. The rate of abandoned calls shall be less than five percent
(5%) over any thirty-day period of time. "Abandoned calls" shall in
no event be deemed to include calls in which the caller hangs up
within forty-five (45) seconds of making the call.
M. With respect to the standards listed in Subsection L of this section, it
shall be the MCS provider's responsibility to be able, if required, to
quarterly certify to the Council/franchising authority that the affected
MCS provider is meeting the minimal standards. [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
A. Provide wheelchair accessibility to an MCS provider's customer service
office.
B. Provide, for which it may impose a nondiscriminatory charge, and if
otherwise made available, a remote control device and/or converter for
ambulatory-impaired subscribers or subscribers with a permanent
medical or physical ambulatory impairment.
C. Where applicable, provide modified or special instructions for use of
equipment by individuals who have physical impairments.
A. An MCS provider shall not, as to rules, regulations, rates, charges,
provision of service or use of a provider's facilities and equipment,

make, allow or grant any undue preference or advantage to any person
nor subject any person to prejudice or disadvantage on the basis of
age, race, creed, color, sex, national origin, nonrelevant handicap as
defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act or religious affiliation.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. Consistent with Section 621(a)(3) of the Cable Act [codified at 47 U.S.C.
§ 541(a)(3)], MCS providers classified as "cable operators" shall not
deny cable service or the extension of cable service to any group of
potential residential cable subscribers because of the income of the
residents of the local area in which such group resides.
C. Subsection A of this section, however, does not prohibit an MCS
provider from:
(1) Offering a promotional or incentive discount rate or charge as long
as the rate or charge does not exceed three hundred seventy (370)
days in length. This subsection does not prohibit an MCS provider
from offering special incentive rates, such as one-month basic
service free if twelve (12) months of basic service are paid in one
(1) payment or within a certain time frame or similar types of
prepayment discounts (as long as such is not prohibited by the
NYSCCT).
(2) Denying service based on location of residence if that residence is
outside the parameters for line extension as detailed in a franchise
agreement (if applicable).
(3) Denying service to a subscriber who is more than thirty (30) days
delinquent in the payment of any periodic service or special service
bill, so long as the requirements for disconnection (as outlined in
this chapter) have been satisfied.
(4) Implementing a service tier or service cluster for lower-income
and/or fixed-income individuals. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
(5) Making agreements or entering into multichannel service
agreements with multiple-dwelling-unit owners (including hotel,
motel and mobile park owners) to provide multichannel service
under a bulk billing or other type of arrangement.
A. Prior to formally delivering any equipment, including auxiliary
equipment, to a customer, an MCS provider shall have tested a
representative sample [at least one percent (1%)] of such equipment to
make sure that it is in proper working order, unless such equipment has
been pretested already or such equipment is tested at the time of
installation. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
§ 185-46 TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 185-47
185:735
B. If needed for proper operation or requested by a customer, an MCS
provider shall deliver to a customer handwritten or typed instructions
detailing the proper use of rented, loaned or purchased equipment.
Unless required by another section of this chapter, an MCS provider
may comply with this section by delivering the manufacturer's
instructions to a customer.
C. An MCS provider is not required to seek a security deposit from a
customer for use or rental of the MCS provider's equipment.
D. An MCS provider shall comply with any and all applicable state rules
(including any applicable PSC rules and regulations) concerning the
imposition, retention and return of security deposits. [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
E. If the state and/or PSC is silent on the security deposit for a particular
piece of equipment, then the MCS provider shall be prohibited from
charging any security deposit for equipment which exceeds the value of
the equipment. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
F. As a matter of consumer protection, an MCS provider shall be
prohibited from charging any security deposit for multichannel service
which exceeds twice the basic monthly rate.64
G. An MCS provider shall return a security deposit held to secure
equipment return (together with any interest earned) after the
equipment is satisfactorily returned, and a deposit held to secure
service payment shall be returned when the subscriber maintains a
satisfactory payment history (which is determined as no payment
delinquencies within the preceding twelve-month period). There shall
be separate deposits for equipment and service if deposits are required.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
H. A customer shall maintain any equipment rented or leased from an MCS
provider in good working order and operate such equipment only in the
manner specified by the MCS provider or manufacturer of the
equipment.
I. A customer shall totally and fully reimburse an MCS provider for any
damage or loss to an MCS provider's equipment that is due to the
customer's failure to properly maintain and operate such equipment.
J. A customer shall be relieved from any responsibility for reimbursing an
MCS provider for equipment which malfunctions or does not operate
due to a hidden or latent defect in the equipment or for equipment
which fails to operate or improperly operates due to natural
occurrences conditioned by the normal wear and tear of such
equipment.65

A. An MCS provider shall be required to keep and maintain service inquiry
logs subject to any limitations imposed by the PSC or by state or federal
law, including (for MCS providers classified as "cable operators") any
subscriber privacy limitations imposed by the Cable Act. [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. The purpose of the service inquiry logs is to assist the city in assessing
(in the aggregate) the type, degree and resolution of customer service
requests, inquiries and complaints.
C. At a minimum, the service inquiry logs should contain the following:
(1) The time and date of initial receipt of any service request, inquiry
or complaint relating to service outage or transmission problems,
together with the time and date of initial response to that service
request, inquiry or complaint. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.

(2) The nature of the service request, inquiry or complaint.
(3) The precise action taken by an MCS provider in order to resolve the
service inquiry, request or complaint.
(4) Whether the service request, inquiry or complaint was resolved by
allowing a credit or refund of some sort.
(5) The area, location or quadrant of the city where the service
request, inquiry or request was generated.
D. In addition to any other right of inspection that the Council/franchising
authority may possess, it shall have the right to review and inspect a
compilation of such logs. However, the Council/franchising authority
shall not have the right of access, review or inspection for any service
inquiry logs or any information contained within service inquiry logs
that are otherwise protected from access, review or inspection by
federal or state law (including any applicable PSC rules and
regulations). [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]

A. At any time an MCS provider (in furtherance of its right to construct,
operate and maintain a multichannel system) disturbs the yard,
residence or other real or personal property of a subscriber and/or upon
a request by the subscriber for restoration of property, such MCS
provider shall ensure that the subscriber's yard, residence or other
personal property is returned, replaced and/or restored to a condition
that is reasonably comparable to the condition that existed prior to the
commencement of the work. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.

B. The costs associated with both the disturbance and the return,
replacement and/or restoration shall be borne by the MCS provider
unless the disturbance was made at the request of the subscriber or
property owner. This subsection also requires the MCS provider or the
subscriber to reimburse the private property owner for any actual
physical damage caused by the MCS provider, its subcontractor or its
independent contractor in connection with the disturbance of the
private property owner's property. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.

flowers, trees, driveway or fence to install, trench, repair, replace,
remove or locate cable or other equipment of an MCS provider;
(2) Installation or removal of cable or other equipment of an MCS
provider within a residence which requires drilling, excavating,
plastering or the like on the part of the MCS provider;
(3) Temporarily relocating or moving a piece of personal property or a
fixture of a subscriber (such as a motor vehicle, fence, airconditioning
or heating unit or the like) in order to perform some
sort of construction, maintenance or repair on the multichannel
system; or
(4) Permanently removing an MCS provider's cable or equipment due
to either the revocation, termination or nonrenewal of a franchise
(if applicable) or the abandonment, withdrawal or cessation of
multichannel service to any portion of the city.

D. The requirements imposed upon the MCS provider extend to any
subcontractor or independent contractor that the MCS provider might
employ to perform the tasks outlined in this section.
E. In light of the foregoing, an MCS provider has the responsibility to
diligently take all reasonable steps to protect the system and its
component from conflicts (contact) with tree limbs (e.g., employing the
accepted practice of installing tree guards).
A. Except in times of a natural or man-made emergency or an appointment
scheduled with the mutual consent of a subscriber, an MCS provider
shall, under normal operating conditions, respond to the service
inquiries, requests and complaints of subscribers within such MCS
provider's normal business or service hours and within the time
schedules detailed in Subsections B through F of this section. The MCS
provider shall be considered in compliance by the Council/franchising
authority if the standards of service outlined in Subsections B through F
are met or exceeded at least ninety-five percent (95%) of the time over
any calendar quarter. Moreover, except in emergency situations, an
MCS provider shall inform the customer that there is a choice as to
whether the service call is scheduled for the morning, afternoon or
evening hours. If the service call has to be canceled or rearranged by
the MCS provider, then the MCS provider shall make every effort to
notify the customer as soon as possible and shall reschedule the service
call within twenty-four (24) hours of the original scheduled service call
unless otherwise mutually agreed upon.
B. In the case of a signal or service interruption (such being defined as a
visually discernible degradation in picture or sound), an MCS provider
shall respond to and begin working on the problem within twenty-four
(24) hours from the time the MCS provider first received notification of
the signal or service interruption.
C. In the case of a "blank" or "no-picture" situation of any given level of
billing or service (except for pay-per-view events), an MCS provider
shall respond to and begin working on the problem within twenty-four
(24) hours from the time the MCS provider first received notification of
the "blank" or "no-picture" situation and continue working until the
problem is resolved.
D. In the case of a defective, improperly operating or nonoperating piece
of equipment affecting the transmission of cable television or MCS
service, an MCS provider shall make its best efforts to respond and
remedy the problem the same day, but in no case will the response be
later than twenty-four (24) hours or one (1) working day from the time
the MCS provider first received notification of the defective, improperly
operating or nonoperating piece of equipment.
§ 185-56 TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 185-57
185:739
§ 185-58. Maintenance and repair.
E. In no case shall a subscriber's service request or inquiry relating to an
area service outage [three (3) or more related calls from the same area]
go unresponded or unattended to for more than twelve (12) hours from
the time the MCS provider first received notification of the service
inquiry or request. Moreover, except in emergency situations and with
the exception of Sundays and regularly scheduled holidays, all service
outage complaints shall receive an immediate response and, if required,
a visit from a service technician on the same day if feasible or by no
later than twenty-four (24) hours following the complaint. In any event,
except for calls or inquiries generated on Sundays or regularly
scheduled holidays, all requests and inquiries shall generate a
telephone response within twenty-four (24) hours unless prevented by
circumstances beyond the service provider's control, and appropriate
collective action or adjustment shall be implemented within one (1)
week from the time the MCS provider first received notification.
F. In case of a dispute concerning the precise time that the MCS provider
received notification or the precise circumstances surrounding the
MCS provider receiving the notification or whether notification was
received at all, the Council/franchising authority reserves the right and
authority to settle such a dispute with the consent of the parties.
However, for MCS providers classified as "cable operators," such MCS
providers have the option of choosing the PSC for the resolution of the
timing dispute.
A. Except in times of natural or man-made emergency, an MCS provider
shall, at all times, have access to and be able to secure sufficient
maintenance and repair parts and equipment for the MCS system so
that the MCS provider can respond to and begin appropriate steps to
correct all subscriber service interruptions within the time periods
specified in this chapter. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. Having access to and being able to secure sufficient maintenance and
repair parts and equipment is necessary to promptly restore a
subscriber's multichannel service and avoid delays caused by having to
obtain needed parts and equipment.
C. Except in times of natural or man-made emergency or strike by the
employees of the MCS provider [whose duration has been less than
seventy-two (72) hours], an MCS provider shall have sufficient
maintenance and repair personnel so that the MCS provider can
respond to and begin appropriate steps to correct subscriber service
interruptions within the time periods specified in this chapter.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
D. An MCS provider shall be able to certify to the Council/franchising
authority that each service technician has taken and passed an MCS
provider-implemented course designed to train service technicians to
handle their jobs in a courteous, efficient and responsive manner. Also,
§ 185-57 RYE CODE § 185-58
185:740
§ 185-59. Installations; connections.
§ 185-60. Disconnection for nonpayment.
the course should be designed to provide continuing education to
service technicians in changes in technology, repair/maintenance
procedures and related matters. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
E. Notwithstanding the other requirements and provisions contained in
this section, an MCS provider shall maintain at least one (1) service
technician on call twenty-four (24) hours per day.
A. Under normal operating conditions, new installations, promotional,
short-term or seasonal connections, reconnections and upgrades of
multichannel service by an MCS provider shall be performed and
completed within seven (7) days (excluding holidays) of a customer
requesting such. This standard shall be met no less than ninety-five
percent (95%) of the time as measured on the basis of a calendar
quarter. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. The provisions of Subsection A of this section shall not apply to pay-perview
or menu-driven connections.
C. While an MCS provider may charge a customer for installing,
connecting or reconnecting multichannel service, such charge must be
explained to and approved by the customer prior to the installation,
connection or reconnection.
D. In the case of a promotional or seasonal connection, any limitations or
restrictions must be explained to the subscriber prior to the
promotional or seasonal connection.
E. An MCS provider may charge an appropriate reconnection charge or
require a security deposit. However, the reconnection charge or
security deposit related to an involuntary disconnection must not be
based on the location or address of the residence or structure.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
F. Downgrading a particular service level or service cluster to a lowerpriced
or less comprehensive service or cluster level shall not subject
the subscriber to an installation or service change charge in excess of
that authorized and permitted under applicable federal and state law
and rules or, in the absence of such law or rules, in an amount greater
than the cost of implementing such downgrade. [Amended 5-29-1996
by L.L. No. 4-1996]
G. An MCS provider classified as a "cable operator" shall comply with any
and all rules and regulations of the PSC concerning downgrading.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
§ 185-58 TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 185-60
185:741
§ 185-61. Voluntary disconnections and downgrades.
A. As regards subjecting a subscriber to involuntary disconnection, a
subscriber shall not be considered delinquent in payment until at least
forty-five (45) days after the posting of the bill to the subscriber.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. Before disconnection of a subscriber's multichannel service (either
physically or electronically) takes place, the following must occur:
(1) The subscriber must in fact be delinquent in payment of
multichannel service; and
(2) At least five (5) days have elapsed after a separate written notice of
impending disconnection has been personally served upon the
subscriber; or
(3) At least eight (8) days have elapsed after mailing a separate written
notice of impending disconnection to the subscriber; or
(4) At least five (5) days have elapsed after the subscriber has either
signed for, or refused to accept, a separate written notice of
impending disconnection.
C. The written notice of disconnection must expressly and clearly state the
amount that is owed by the subscriber to an MCS provider, the
minimum amount required to be paid to avoid disconnection and the
date and place where such payment must be made.
D. Disconnection of service must occur both on a normal service day and
within normal business hours of an MCS provider unless the subscriber
agrees otherwise or is given the opportunity to pay the full amount of
the past due account. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
E. An MCS provider which physically retrieves its equipment (including
converter, remote control unit or digital audio tuner) from a subscriber
must do so within both a normal service day and normal service hours
of an MCS provider, unless otherwise agreed to by the subscriber.
F. Receipt of a bad check from a subscriber, in response to a written notice
of disconnection, does not constitute payment, and the affected MCS
provider need not give the subscriber further notice prior to
disconnecting multichannel service.
G. An MCS provider may add a reasonable collection charge to the
subscriber's bill if the applicable provisions of this chapter and any
applicable state regulations (including those of the PSC) are followed.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
H. Any refund due to a subscriber after such a disconnection shall be made
within sixty (60) days of the disconnection for nonpayment unless the
subscriber has changed addresses without notifying the MCS provider.
§ 185-60 RYE CODE § 185-61
185:742
A. At any time, a subscriber may request that a particular service tier,
service cluster, menu-driven program/service, premium channel,
informational service or the entire multichannel service be
disconnected.
B. Where provided by an MCS provider, a subscriber may request a
downgrade from a particular level of service to a less comprehensive
level of service or a less expensive level of service.
C. From the date that such a subscriber makes such a request for either a
disconnection or downgrade, then the MCS provider shall have seventytwo
(72) hours or three (3) service days, whichever is longer, to
disconnect or downgrade the service tier, pay channel, premium
channel, informational service or entire multichannel service. In the
event that an MCS provider does not disconnect or downgrade service
within seventy-two (72) hours, a subscriber's obligation to pay for such
service shall cease, or, in the case of a downgrade, a subscriber's
obligation to pay for the more comprehensive and/or higher priced
service shall cease.
D. For a service tier, service cluster, menu-driven service, premium
channel or informational service which is voluntarily disconnected, a
subscriber shall pay a pro rata share of the monthly rate for such
service tier, service cluster, menu-driven service, premium channel or
informational service.
E. Once a valid connection to a menu-driven program or a pay-per-view
event occurs, then the MCS provider may collect the full advertised or
quoted rate, should the customer then attempt to disconnect the menudriven
program or pay-per-view event.
F. For MCS providers classified as "cable operators," any charge or billing
imposed on a subscriber as a result of a downgrade by such MCS
providers shall be no more than the maximum permitted by FCC and
PSC rules and regulations. For other MCS providers, the Council/
franchising authority reserves the right to approve any charge or billing
that would be imposed on a subscriber as a result of a downgrade in
service. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
G. If, however, an MCS provider's equipment is or has been lost,
appropriated or damaged by a subscriber prior to such disconnection,
then the MCS provider may charge the subscriber with the entire cost
for such loss or damage, provided that the MCS provider notify the
subscriber within thirty (30) days of the disconnection. A subscriber
shall not be required to pay for equipment failure if the circumstances
fall within the normal wear and tear or acts of nature guidelines
established in this chapter. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
H. Any refund due a subscriber after voluntary disconnection and/or
downgrade shall be made within sixty (60) days after such

The Council/franchising authority recognizes the fact that it is in the
public's interest to be able to utilize the functions inherent in subscriber
receiving equipment without having to incur additional costs to obtain
the same functions. Consequently, the Council/franchising authority may
require that the MCS provider comply with applicable federal or state law
or rules relating to the availability of compatible customer equipment.

notifying the MCS provider.
I. In no event will this section be viewed as abridging the rights and
remedies afforded by the subscriber complaint/inquiry resolution
process outlined in this chapter.
J. The provisions contained in this section concerning downgrades shall
be considered supplemental to any applicable rules and regulations of
the PSC. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
A. An MCS provider shall abide by any and all subscriber privacy rules or
regulations of the federal or state governments (including any
applicable rules and regulations of the PSC).
B. For MCS providers classified as cable operators, such operators shall
also abide by and comply with any subscriber privacy protection
requirements and procedures listed in Section 631 of the Cable Act
(codified at 47 USC § 551).
A. An MCS provider is required to develop a comprehensive complaint/
inquiry resolution policy that is consistent with the rules and
regulations outlined in this chapter.
B. An MCS provider's complaint/inquiry resolution policy shall be reduced
to writing, and such policy shall be available upon request to any
person. In any event, a subscriber shall receive notice of such policy in
the manner that is prescribed by this chapter and any state rules and
regulations (including those of the PSC). Further, nothing in this section
shall prohibit a customer from seeking relief from the PSC for any

matter within its jurisdiction. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
C. An MCS provider's complaint/inquiry resolution policy shall contain at
least the following minimal standards: [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
(1) Except in the event of circumstances beyond the control of the
service provider, e.g., natural disaster, the initial response to any
complaint/inquiry relating to a service problem shall occur no later
than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of the complaint/inquiry,
with the exception of Sundays and regularly scheduled holidays.
Appropriate collective action or adjustment shall be implemented
within one (1) week.
(2) Every reasonable attempt will be made to resolve the complaint/
inquiry relating to service problems within twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt of the complaint/inquiry.
(3) Complaints/inquiries that fall into the category of inquiries for
service changes or additions shall be addressed by the procedure
set forth in this chapter.
(4) Informing subscribers of the credit/refund policy which is
consistent with this chapter and any applicable state regulations
(including those of the PSC).
(5) Informing subscribers of the billing disputes policy which is
consistent with this chapter and any applicable state regulations
(including those of the PSC).
A. The Council/franchising authority declares that as part of its right to
establish multichannel customer service guidelines it is in the public
interest to ensure continuity of multichannel service for all subscribers.
In that light, the Council/franchising authority also determines that it
may take appropriate measures in order to ensure that no portion of the
city is threatened or faced with a disruption, interruption or
discontinuance of multichannel service due to the actions of any MCS
provider.
B. In addition to the principles and ideals enumerated in Subsection A, the
Council/franchising authority also expresses that its policy covers the
following:
(1) To provide for continuity of multichannel service in the event of
acquisition by the city.
(2) To provide for continuity of service in the event of a proposed
abandonment, withdrawal or cessation of multichannel service by
an MCS provider.
§ 185-67 TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 185-68
185:745
(3) To provide for continuity of service in the event of revocation,
termination or nonrenewal of a franchised MCS provider's
franchise.
(4) To provide for continuity of service in the event that a transaction
occurs that affects the ownership or control of the MCS provider,
such as an assignment, sale, transfer or merger.
(5) To provide for continuity of service in the event of an expiration of a
franchise.
(6) To prevent disruption of multichannel service which would provide
a hardship on those subscribers who rely on a multichannel system
as their primary or secondary source of information.
(7) To prevent the interruption or cessation of multichannel service
which would disrupt or eliminate the diversity of programming
choices enjoyed by subscribers of a multichannel system and
thereby restrict their ability to receive information.
C. In any situation (including any of those mentioned above), which
threatens the city and subscribers with the loss or interruption in the
continuity of multichannel service, then the MCS provider shall, to the
extent that it has adequate advance knowledge, provide the Council/
franchising authority with at least forty-five (45) days notice (except in
extreme circumstances) prior to the effective date of any action which
would cause a loss or interruption in the continuity of multichannel
service. The purpose of the notice is to apprise the Council/franchising
authority of the possibility of such loss or interruption in the continuity
of multichannel service so that it might explore its options and take
appropriate measures. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
D. Whenever any situation occurs (including those mentioned above)
which threatens the city and subscribers with the loss or interruption in
the continuity of multichannel service, then the Council/franchising
authority may permit the MCS provider for a period of up to twenty-four
(24) months to do everything in its power to ensure that all subscribers
receive continuous, uninterrupted multichannel service of the same
quality, mix and level(s) regardless of the circumstances. [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
E. During the interim period, the Council/franchising authority shall work
with the MCS provider in order to secure a new multichannel system
owner or rectify the problem so that the threat of loss of continuity is
removed at the earliest possible instance.
F. During any interim period in which the MCS provider continues to
provide multichannel service to subscribers, the MCS provider is
entitled to all revenues collected, except any sums owed (including
franchise fees, alternative user charges and taxes) to the city or to other
persons.

In order to establish minimum uniform standards, the Council/franchise
authority requires any MCS provider to adopt the following minimal
construction schedule and construction-related requirements:
G. In the event that the threat of loss of continuity is not resolved within
twenty-four (24) months, then the Council/franchising authority may
extend the interim period on a month-to-month basis until the situation
is satisfactorily resolved. Also, in such a circumstance, the Council/
franchising authority may adopt any emergency rules or procedures
which will ensure that the subscribers will receive continuous,
uninterrupted multichannel service of the same quality, mix and
level(s).
H. Nothing in this section should be construed as requiring an MCS
provider to operate a multichannel system at a continued financial loss
(due to bankruptcy or insolvency) for an extended period of time.
Consequently, the Council/franchising authority may take appropriate
steps to ensure the continuity of service. [Amended 5-29-1996 by
L.L. No. 4-1996]
A. The Council/franchising authority does not intend to prohibit the
erection or continued use of individual television antennas within the
city so long as the individual television antennas conform to any and all
applicable zoning and/or land use regulations. Consequently, no person
shall be required to receive multichannel service or to physically
connect to a multichannel system.
B. It is also noted that no person shall be penalized or fined (through
either a home sales contract, deed of restrictive covenants or other type
of agreement) for failing or refusing to receive multichannel service or
physically connecting to a multichannel system.

185:747
§ 185-77. Construction quality.
During any phase of construction, installation, maintenance and repair of

other property and facilities of an MCS provider shall be so located,
constructed installed and maintained so as not to endanger or
unnecessarily interfere with usual and customary use, traffic and travel
upon the streets, rights-of-way, easements and public ways of the city.
To prevent the unnecessary disruption of the flow of traffic during peak
traffic hours, any MCS provider shall make reasonable efforts to
minimize unnecessary work associated with construction, installation
(other than in subscriber homes) activities that involve working on or
within the street system between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. or 3:00 p.m.
and 6:00 p.m. on regular business weekdays. [Amended 5-29-1996 by
L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. In the event that an MCS provider's system creates a hazardous or
unsafe condition or an unreasonable interference with property, then,
at its own expense, such MCS provider shall, voluntarily or upon the
request of the Council/franchising authority, remove that part of the
system that creates the hazardous condition from the subject property.
C. An MCS provider shall not place equipment where it will interfere with
the rights of property owners or with gas, electric or telephone fixtures
or with water hydrants or mains or with wastewater lift stations, any
traffic control system or any other service or facility that benefits the
city's or its residents' health, safety or welfare.
§ 185-76 RYE CODE § 185-78
185:748
§ 185-79. Removal of franchised properties.
D. An MCS provider, at either its own expense or that of a private
contractor, shall protect rights-of-way and easements and support or
temporarily disconnect or relocate in the same street or other public
way any property of such MCS provider when necessitated by reason
of:
(1) Traffic conditions.
(2) Public safety.
(3) A street closing.
(4) Street construction or resurfacing.
(5) A change or establishment of street grade.
(6) Installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, storm drains, lift
stations, force mains, power or signal lines and any traffic control
system.
(7) Any improvement, construction or repair related to the city's or its
residents' health, safety or welfare.
E. It shall be the responsibility of an MCS provider (acting alone or in
conjunction with another person), upon request, to locate and mark or
otherwise visibly indicate and alert others to the location of its
underground cable (coaxial, fiber or functional equivalent) before
employees, agents or independent contractors of any entity install cable
in the marked-off area. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
F. An MCS provider shall, on the request of any person holding a building
moving permit, temporarily remove, raise or lower the cable wires to
allow the moving of the building. The expense of temporary removal
shall be paid by the person requesting it, and such MCS provider may
require payment in advance. The affected MCS provider shall be given
not less than twenty-one (21) days' notice of a contemplated move to
arrange for temporary wire changes.
G. For any new installations occurring after the effective date of this
chapter and at the time that an MCS provider rebuilds or upgrades the
multichannel system, all trunk or feeder cable (coaxial, fiber or
functional equivalent) shall be placed underground when and if other
utilities are required to have their facilities placed underground.
Further, where both power and utilities are presently required to be
underground, multichannel system cable shall also be placed
underground. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
A. This section is applicable to any MCS provider required to maintain a
franchise to operate within the city.
§ 185-78 TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 185-79
185:749
B. Unless the city or another MCS provider uses such multichannel
system, under the continuity provisions outlined in this chapter or
unless other arrangements have been agreed to by the Council/
franchising authority or the owners of the property where the subject
facilities are located, the affected franchised MCS provider shall
promptly remove any portions of its multichannel system property that
if not removed could pose a hazard to public health, safety or welfare or
a harm to the interests of the city from the streets, public ways and
private property located within the city whenever the following occurs:
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
(1) A franchised MCS provider ceases to operate all or part of the
multichannel system for a continuous period of six (6) months;
(2) A franchised MCS provider ceases and fails to construct the
multichannel system outlined in the application or proposal for
renewal or renewal franchise agreement;
(3) The Council/franchising authority elects not to renew the franchise
pursuant to the provisions set forth in this chapter; or
(4) The franchised MCS provider's franchise is revoked pursuant to the
provisions set forth in this chapter.
C. If not removed voluntarily by a franchised MCS provider, then the
Council/franchising authority may notify such franchised MCS provider
that if removal of any property that is found to be likely to constitute a
hazard or harm if not removed is not accommodated within two
hundred seventy (270) days or substantial progress towards removal is
not made within two hundred ten (210) days, then the Council/
franchising authority may direct officials or representatives of the city
to remove such franchised MCS provider's system property at that
franchised MCS provider's expense. The performance and/or
construction bond, irrevocable letter of credit, cash deposit or full faith
and credit guarantee required as set forth in this chapter shall be
available to pay for such work. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
D. If officials or representatives of the city remove a franchised MCS
provider's system property and such franchised MCS provider does not
claim the property within ninety (90) days of its removal, then the
Council/franchising authority may take whatever steps are available
under state law to declare the property surplus and sell it, with the
proceeds of such sale (if permitted by state law) going to the city.
E. When such franchised MCS provider removes its multichannel system
property from the streets, public ways and private property located
within the city, the franchised MCS provider shall, at its own expense
and in a manner approved by the Council/franchising authority, replace
and restore such property in as good a condition as before the work

A. Methods of construction, installation, maintenance and repair of any
multichannel system shall comply with the most current editions of the
National Electrical Safety Code and the National Electric Code, as they
affect the construction, installation and maintenance of electrical

extent that these are inconsistent with other provisions of a franchise or
state or local law, then the state law shall apply unless the state allows
the local law to control.
B. All construction, installation, maintenance and repair shall treat the
aesthetics of the property as a priority and shall not unreasonably
impair the appearance of the structure. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
C. All underground drops shall follow (to the greatest extent possible) all
reasonable construction and installation standards required under city,
state or federal rules. Underground installations shall be constructed in
accordance with the specifications and requirements of the City of Rye
and the National Electric Safety Code and must be designed to
minimize disruption to the city's underground facilities associated with
the computerized traffic control system network. [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
D. For existing multichannel system construction, installation and repair,
the provisions of Subsection C of this section shall apply only at the
time a scheduled upgrade or rebuild of the MCS provider's
multichannel system is actually commenced. For newly served areas,
then the provisions of Subsection C of this section shall apply at the
time of initial construction and/or installation.
E. In instances where either electrical or telephone utilities wire or cable
aerially, then the MCS provider may construct its multichannel system
aerially unless otherwise required by state law (including any
applicable PSC rules and regulations). [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
F. In instances where both electrical or telephone utilities are required to

its multichannel system underground unless otherwise permitted by
state law (including applicable PSC rules and regulations). However,
where existing aerial electrical or telephone utilities convert to
underground facilities, an existing aerial MCS provider shall have the
option to continue remaining aerial for as long as it does not provide a
hazard and is permitted by state law (including any applicable PSC
rules and regulations). [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]

§ 185-82. System expansion.
A. This section is applicable to any MCS provider required to maintain a
franchise to operate within the city which is required to construct or
rebuild an MCS system. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. A franchised MCS provider's construction schedule for the
multichannel system shall be detailed in the franchise agreement in a
form and format determined by the Council/franchising authority.
C. A franchised MCS provider who does not abide by the system
construction schedule shall be handled in the manner allowed under
either this chapter or, where applicable, a franchise agreement or
applicable federal or state law or rules. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
A. The Council/franchising authority recognizes that one of its primary
purposes in the franchising process is to ensure that the widest
diversity of programming sources shall be available to the greatest
number of city residents. The Council/franchising authority is also
cognizant that an MCS provider may have some constitutionally
protected rights with respect to when and what areas of the city are
provided service.
B. In order to balance those interests, the Council/franchising authority
sets the minimum guidelines for any system expansion on the part of a
franchised MCS provider.
C. A franchised MCS provider shall submit, within six (6) months of the
effective date of this chapter, a detailed plan for multichannel system
expansion to any area in which the public streets are not presently
served within the city. Such plan should not be construed as a
requirement for universal service, but rather as a means for achieving
the Council/franchising authority's goals mentioned in Subsection A.
However, at a minimum, a franchised MCS provider shall extend
multichannel service to any area within the city that has a density of
twenty (20) home or building passings per mile, or fractional equivalent
thereof, as measured from the extremity of the system nearest the
unserved area. Also, in such a case, a newly installed subscriber shall
not be assessed or apportioned the cost for installation, except for the
usual and normal connection fees paid by subscribers and except for
the costs of custom service arrangements or exceptional distance from
the public streets or ways, so long as the system expansion is
technically feasible. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
D. The detailed plan must include criteria for extending the provision of
service to isolated subscribers. For purposes of this section, "isolated
subscribers" means any potential customer of a franchised MCS

An MCS provider shall obtain, at its own expense, all permits and licenses
required by local law, rule, regulation or ordinance and maintain the same,
in full force and effect, for as long as required by the city or other
appropriate entity.
§ 185-84. Technical and performance standards. [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
The MCS provider shall comply with and abide by any and all applicable
rules and regulations of the NYSCCT concerning the performance and
integrity of the multichannel system.
§ 185-85. Proof-of-performance tests. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
The MCS provider shall design and conduct any and all tests necessary to
verify the performance and technical integrity of the multichannel system.
Such tests shall be performed at least annually and shall be in accordance
(where applicable) with any and all rules and regulations of the PSC
concerning proof-of-performance.

provider who dwells in a house more than one-half (1/2) mile from the
nearest franchised MCS provider connection.
A. In order to verify that an MCS provider constructed and maintained the
multichannel system in the manner required by this chapter and
conducted the various performance, technical integrity (including
cumulative leakage), preventive maintenance and safety tests required
by federal, state (including PSC) and local laws required by this
chapter, the Council/franchising authority reserves the right to inspect
all facets of an MCS provider's construction as well as inspect
documents related to construction and inspect tests related to
performance, technical integrity, preventive maintenance and safety.
B. The Council/franchising authority shall pay for all its costs associated
with such an inspection, except for those circumstances precipitated by
an MCS provider's unreasonable refusal to provide necessary
information (such as, schematic drawings or as-built maps) or
occasioned by the repeated failure to construct, install, maintain,
repair, rebuild or upgrade in the manner specified and required by this
chapter or, where applicable, a franchise agreement. In such instances,
the MCS provider shall pay for such costs incurred by the city caused by
the MCS provider's refusal to supply necessary information or repeated
failure to abide by the rules.

§ 185-91. Emergency provisions.
A. The Council/franchising authority requires that the MCS provider's
construction, operation and maintenance of the multichannel system
meet certain threshold safety levels which are designed to protect the
public and lessen the likelihood of interruption of multichannel service.
B. Consequently, the Council/franchising authority requires any MCS
provider to adopt the following safety requirements:
(1) Emergency alert override activation in the manner set forth in this
chapter.
(2) Minimum standby power as noted in this chapter.66
(3) Implementing a periodic preventative maintenance program, as set
forth in this chapter.67
(4) Complying with and abide by any construction, safety or fire codes,
as noted in this chapter.
A. In order that subscribers may be alerted in the event of an impending,
imminent or actual natural or man-made emergency, all MCS providers
shall ensure that the multichannel system providing multichannel
service to all or part of the city is designed so as to permit an authorized
official of the city to override the audio portion of all channels by touchtone
phone (or functional equivalent) from any location.
B. In addition to any other requirements listed in this section, an MCS
provider shall:
(1) Designate a channel which will be used for emergency broadcasts
of both audio and video (this channel need not be solely used for
emergency broadcasts and may in fact be used for any lawful
purpose).
(2) Inform subscribers of the designated emergency channel on a
periodic basis with reasonable regularity (not less than once a
week). [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]

(4) Cooperate with the city on the use and operation of the emergency
alert override system.
(5) Develop a plan (with the city's concurrence) in order to provide
continuity of multichannel service and response to service calls in
the event of a natural or man-made emergency.
C. As one (1) method of providing continuity of multichannel services in
the event of a natural or man-made emergency, an MCS provider shall,
unless exempted by the Council/franchising authority, have the capacity
for three-hour automatically activated standby power on all trunk and
feeder cable and all head ends, hubs and receiver sites associated with
the distribution of cable service to and throughout the city.
A. It shall be the duty of an MCS provider to devise and implement a
periodic preventative maintenance program for the multichannel
system in order to ensure that there is no material degradation of the
multichannel system that would affect the citizens' health, safety and
welfare or negatively affect the quality of multichannel services being
provided.
B. Such a program may be reviewed and approved by the Council/
franchising authority. Such approval by the Council/franchising
authority shall not be unreasonably withheld for an MCS providerdesigned
preventive maintenance plan that meets the objectives of the
Council/franchising authority. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
C. Within forty-five (45) days after the completion of any preventive
maintenance component test, the MCS provider shall be prepared to
make available for inspection a written report (except for daily or
weekly components and tests which may be submitted once a quarter)
to the Council/franchising authority detailing the results of the tests
conducted and all items performed or addressed during the periodic
preventive maintenance program. Although not exhaustive, the
following areas should be included in a preventive maintenance
program and subsequent report: [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.

§ 185-100. Alternative user charge.
A. This section is applicable to any licensed but otherwise authorized
nonfranchised MCS provider and to any franchised MCS provider who
has had its franchise ruled unconstitutional, unenforceable or invalid.
For all franchised MCS providers the provisions concerning franchise
fees shall be applicable. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. Where not specifically prohibited by federal or state law and as an
alternative to the imposition of a franchise fee as set forth in this
chapter, the Council/franchising authority may impose, extract and
collect a charge from an affected MCS provider for the use by such
provider of the streets, rights-of-way, easements and public ways of the
city.
C. Such an alternative user charge shall be based on the value of the
public rights-of-way being used by the affected MCS provider. However,
in no event shall the alternative user charge exceed five percent (5%) of
the affected MCS provider's gross revenue for the reporting period.
D. The Council/franchising authority adopts such an alternative user
charge in order to receive fair compensation for the affected MCS
provider's use of the public streets and public ways if such
compensation cannot be obtained by imposing a flat percentage fee on
such MCS provider's annual gross revenue. However, an affected MCS
provider may agree to an alternative charge that is based on a flat
percentage of gross revenue, as long as that charge does not exceed
five percent (5%) of an affected MCS provider's annual gross revenue.
E. Also, recognizing that an alternative user charge may affect a
franchised MCS provider, please note that the franchise agreement may
contain express language which details a different method or manner to
handle a situation in which franchise fees as historically calculated (as a
percentage of gross revenue) are ruled unconstitutional or
unenforceable, in order to protect and preserve the city's source of
revenue and compensation for the use of the public rights-of-way.
F. It is expressly understood that a franchise fee and an alternative user
charge will not be imposed on the same MCS provider at the same time
for the same period.
G. An affected MCS provider shall at no time be charged or obligated to
pay an alternative user charge that exceeds five percent (5%) of such
provider's gross revenue (as defined by this chapter) for any particular
reporting period. In the event that the alternative user charge does
exceed five percent (5%) of gross revenue, then such alternative user

charge shall be reduced to reflect an amount not greater than the fivepercent
cap.
H. An affected MCS provider shall pay twenty-five percent (25%) of the
alternative user charge at the end of every three (3) months.
A. Except as provided in Subsections B, C and D of this section, no person
or MCS provider shall be permitted to construct, operate or maintain a
multichannel system which requires the laying or positioning or use of
cable (coaxial, fiber or functional equivalent) across the rights-of-way of
the city without having first obtained from the city an MCS franchise
which is then in effect or whose provisions have been renewed or
extended temporarily. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. Pursuant to the Cable Act, a local government may own and operate a
multichannel system classified as a "cable system." No franchise shall
be required for the city, or any local or municipal authority affiliated
with it, operating as an MCS provider in the franchised area.
C. If, as a result of annexation (either previous to or subsequent to the
effective date of this chapter), a previously unfranchised MCS provider
comes under the jurisdiction of the city, then such MCS provider shall
not be required to obtain a franchise and enter into a franchise
agreement unless the Council/franchising authority expressly gives
written notification to the MCS provider that it is required to do so.
D. Where a person or MCS provider is required by the Council/franchising
authority to obtain a franchise, then the Council/franchising authority
shall notify the person or MCS provider, in writing, within thirty (30)
days of the Council/franchising authority's formal action.
E. After receipt of notification, the affected person or MCS provider shall
have ninety (90) days in which to submit an application or proposal in
substantially the same form and format as required by the Council/
franchising authority. Then the affected person's or MCS provider's
application will be handled as set forth by either state or local law.
A. Consistent with Section 621(a)(1) of the Cable Act (codified at 47 U.S.C.
§ 541), the Council/franchising authority may award one (1) or more
nonexclusive multichannel service franchises within its geographical
limits.
B. A franchised MCS provider shall be selected as part of a public
proceeding and hearing which affords due process to both the city and
the applicant and in accordance with the procedure set forth by the
federal, state (including any applicable PSC rules and regulations) and
local laws and regulations. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]

effect.
B. A franchise agreement shall be in sufficient detail in order to clearly
delineate the rights and duties of both the franchised MCS provider and
the Council/franchising authority.
C. At a minimum, a franchise agreement shall contain, to the extent
appropriate, provisions for the following: [Amended 5-29-1996 by
L.L. No. 4-1996]
(1) A detailed definition of "gross revenue" which specifically includes
an explanation of what constitutes the revenue base for
determining what revenues are subject to any franchise fee or
alternative user charge.
(2) The term or duration of the franchise.
(3) Indemnity and holds harmless clauses.

clarifications noted with respect to the MCS provider's operation of
a franchised multichannel system.
A. Upon an award of a franchise, in accordance with the terms of such
franchise agreement, an MCS provider required to obtain and maintain
a franchise may construct, erect, install, maintain, operate, repair,
replace, remove or restore a multichannel system within the
geographical limits set forth in the franchise agreement.

property (including privately owned utility or streetlight poles) shall be
that of a franchised MCS provider. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.

D. A franchised MCS provider, through a separate pole or utility easement
agreement with an affected utility, may locate the multichannel system
on or within the property of such utility company. This provision
specifically includes MCS providers classified as "cable operators."
A. The term of an initial MCS franchise may be for a period not to exceed
ten (10) years from the date that a franchise agreement is both
approved and executed by the Council/franchising authority (and,
where applicable, the PSC). [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.

renewal agreement is both approved and executed by the Council/
franchising authority (and, where applicable, the PSC). [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
C. If an initial franchise or renewal franchise is for a period of six (6) years
or less, then the city shall detail the reasons for granting the shorter
franchise, in the franchise agreement or elsewhere.
A. The Council/franchising authority may develop rules and regulations
with respect to the submission and processing of applications for a
franchise. Such rules shall be consistent with and/or subordinate to any
applicable rules and regulations of the state (including, where
applicable, those of the PSC). Further, such rules and regulations shall
primarily be aimed at determining the legal, financial, technical and
character qualifications of the applicant for a franchise.
B. Unless prohibited by any state agency (including the PSC) and unless
inconsistent with applicable federal law, an applicant shall pay an
application fee which shall be no greater than the administrative and
consulting costs associated with processing an application for a
franchise. The total application fee must be paid, unless waived (totally
or partially), regardless of whether the applicant receives or does not

prior to the Council/franchising authority's formal action on the
applicant's request for a franchise.
A. Any franchised MCS provider (specifically including any MCS provider
classified as a "cable operator") awarded a franchise or renewal
franchise after the date this chapter becomes effective shall pay to the
city for the privilege and use of the streets, rights-of-way, easements
and public ways and other facilities of the city in the operation of the
multichannel system and for the city's supervision thereof during the
term of the franchise a sum equal to five percent (5%) of gross revenue
for the required period for payment of such franchised MCS provider,
provided that such fee shall be reduced to the extent necessary to
comply with applicable federal and state law and rules when added to
the fees, charges and taxes paid to the PSC or other state or local
entities. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. If the FCC, Congress or other governmental entity with authority over
multichannel service ever allows a governmental entity or Council/
franchising authority to increase the franchise fee beyond five percent
(5%), then the Council/franchising authority shall have the authority to
increase the franchise fee to the maximum percentage allowable,
provided that no increase in fee may be imposed upon a franchisee
during the term of a franchise agreement without the consent of the
franchisee, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law or regulation.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
C. For franchised MCS providers classified as "cable operators," such
franchised MCS providers (consistent with the Cable Act and the
applicable rulings of the FCC or the PSC) may pass through to
subscribers the amount of any increase in a franchise fee unless the
Council/franchising authority demonstrates that the rate structure
specified in the franchise agreement reflects all costs of franchise fees
and so notifies the franchised MCS provider classified as a "cable
operator" in writing. For franchised MCS providers not classified as
"cable operators," such franchised MCS providers must petition and be
granted the authority to pass through any increase in a franchise fee.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
D. Franchised MCS providers shall, to the degree required by the
applicable rulings of the FCC and PSC, pass through to subscribers the
amount of any decrease in a franchise fee. [Amended 5-29-1996 by
L.L. No. 4-1996]
E. A franchised MCS provider shall file with the Council/franchising
authority, within forty-five (45) days after the expiration of each of the
franchised MCS provider's fiscal quarters a detailed financial and
revenue statement clearly showing the franchise fee due for the
preceding quarter, together with the bases of the calculations thereof.
§ 185-106 TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 185-107
185:761
Such statement shall be certified by a certified public accountant or
officer of a franchised MCS provider attesting to the accuracy,
completeness and veracity of the revenue figures. Such statement shall
be in a form and format adequate to show the subject revenue and
fees due (subject to the reasonable review by the Council/franchising
authority) and shall include revenue from any pertinent source.
Revenue will be reported by service category, type and level showing
computations and using incremental billing rates for all sources, levels,
tiers, clusters, types of service and other revenue sources by kind
and type, subject to appropriate protections of proprietary information
and the confidentiality of subscriber information under federal law.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
F. Payment of the quarterly portion of the franchise fee shall be rendered
to the city at the time the financial and revenue statement is filed.
G. In the event that payment is not made by the due date or within sixty
(60) days thereafter upon proper demand, then such franchised MCS
provider may be declared in default of the franchise, and the franchise
may be revoked, terminated or canceled in the manner prescribed by
this chapter. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
H. The Council/franchising authority reserves the right to audit franchised
MCS provider's books if the Council/franchising authority deems it
necessary, subject to appropriate protections of the confidentiality of
subscriber information under federal law. If such audit discovers an
underpayment of franchise fees in any amount, then the affected
franchised MCS provider shall reimburse the city for the cost of such an
audit (unless such cost is waived by the Council/franchising authority)
in accordance with the provisions of § 185-31C of this chapter. It is
specifically understood that the right of audit and recomputation of any
and all amounts paid under a franchise fee shall always be accorded to
the Council/franchising authority. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
I. If an audit or other research discovers that franchise fees have been
either significantly underpaid or not paid for a period exceeding six (6)
months from the original due date, then the city may seek full recovery
of the underpaid or nonpaid fees, plus reasonable interest. [Amended
5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
J. All annual reports due and pertaining to the payment of franchise fees
will be certified by an officer of the franchised MCS provider and will be
provided in the form, format and detail applicable to quarterly reports
under Subsection F above; such provider shall maintain records used in
the preparation of said report to be produced in their originality and
totality upon request or demand by the Council/franchising authority,
subject to protection of the privacy of subscriber information under
federal law. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
§ 185-107 RYE CODE § 185-107

K. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as a release of or an
accord or satisfaction of any claim that the city might have for further
or additional sums payable under the terms of this chapter or for any
other performance or obligation of a franchised MCS provider
hereunder.
L. Payments of compensation made by a franchised MCS provider to the
city pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be considered to the
extent consistent with applicable federal and state law in addition to
and exclusive of, any and all authorized taxes, business license fees,
other fees, other levies or assessments presently in effect or
subsequently adopted. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
M. A franchise fee does not include any items excluded by Section
622(g)(2)(D) of the Cable Act [codified at 47 U.S.C. § 542(G)(2)(D)].
N. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the
Council/franchising authority to impose a tax, fee or other assessment
of any kind on any person (other than a franchised MCS provider) with
respect to multichannel service or other programming or
communications service provided by such person over a multichannel
system for which charges are assessed to subscribers but not received
by a franchised MCS provider. For purposes of illustration only, this
subsection shall include the situation(s) where a premium service
directly bills a subscriber or the franchised MCS provider acts as
collection agent for a premium service billing directly to a subscriber or
where a person leaves a channel for commercial use and sells
advertising or goods on that channel and receives the money directly or
through a third party.
O. For any twelve-month period, the fees paid by any person subject to
Subsection N who provides any such multichannel service shall not
exceed five percent (5%) of such person's gross revenue or such higher
percentage as may be authorized by the FCC, Congress or other
governmental entity derived in such period from the provision of such
service over the multichannel system. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
P. If at any time the highest court of the nation or the highest court of the
state invalidates, voids or rules as unconstitutional the concept of
franchise fees, then the Council/franchising authority may impose an
alternative user charge on the franchised MCS provider in the manner
set forth in this chapter and not inconsistent with the terms of an
applicable franchise agreement or the lawful rights of the franchisee.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
Q. In light of Subsection P of this section and recognizing that an
alternative user charge may affect a franchised MCS provider, please
note that the franchise agreement may contain express language which
details a different method or manner for collection of franchise fees
should the way they historically have been calculated (as a percentage

§ 185-108. Assignment of franchise.
of gross revenue) be ruled unconstitutional or unenforceable so that
the city's source of revenue and compensation for the use of the public
right-of-way may be protected. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.
4-1996]
A. There shall be no assignment of a franchised MCS provider's franchise
by the affected MCS provider, without the prior express written
approval by the Council/franchising authority. [Amended 5-29-1996
by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. Any assignment or transfer without such prior written consent shall
constitute a default of such franchise.
C. In the event of such a default, the Council/franchising authority shall
proceed according to the procedure set forth in this chapter and any
applicable state law (including any applicable rules or regulations of
the PSC). [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
D. At least ninety (90) days before such a proposed assignment of an MCS
provider's franchise is scheduled to become effective, such franchised
MCS provider shall petition, in writing, for the Council/franchising
authority's written consent for such a proposed assignment.
E. The Council/franchising authority will not unreasonably withhold its
consent to such an assignment nor disclose confidential information
considered in connection with such a petition, provided that such
nondisclosure complies with the state's Freedom of Information Law.
However, in making such a determination, the Council/franchising
authority may consider all relevant facts, including the following:
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
(1) Experience of proposed assignee or transferee or buyer.
(2) Qualifications of proposed assignee or transferee or buyer.
(3) Legal integrity of proposed assignee or transferee or buyer.
(4) Financial ability and stability of the proposed assignee before and
after the proposed assignment.
(5) If requested by the Council/franchising authority, submittals from
the proposed assignee or transferee or buyer on what, if any,
changes it intends to make in the operation and maintenance of the
multichannel system.
(6) The corporate connection, if any, between the franchised MCS
provider and proposed assignee or transferee or buyer.
(7) The economic viability or nonviability of the multichannel system
that may result from the proposed assignment in the future, based
§ 185-107 RYE CODE § 185-108
185:764
§ 185-109. Hypothecation.
upon certain factors, including the impact of the purchase price on
the city and/or the proposed assignee or transferee or buyer.
(8) Any claimed benefits which may accrue from the assignments.
(9) Any other legitimate aspect of the proposed assignee's or
transferee's or buyer's background which could affect the health,
safety and welfare of the citizenry of the city as it relates to the
operation of the multichannel system.
F. A copy of the completed sales agreement or a functionally equivalent
instrument between the franchised MCS provider and proposed
assignee or transferee or buyer shall be provided to the Council/
franchising authority so that the Council/franchising authority may
discover the assumption of obligations by the franchised MCS provider
and proposed assignee or transferee or buyer with respect to the
multichannel system. In lieu of the sales agreement, the Council/
franchising authority may, at its election, accept an attested summary
of obligations assumed by the above-referenced parties. The city may
request additional information other than that which is expressly
prohibited by law. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
G. Before an assignment is approved by the Council/franchising authority,
the proposed assignee shall execute an affidavit acknowledging that it
has read, understood and intends to abide by both this chapter and the
applicable franchise agreement.
H. In the event of any approved assignment, the assignee shall assume all
obligations and liabilities of the former franchised MCS provider,
except as noted in Subsection I. Any consent by the city, if granted, may
be absolute or conditional, e.g., with respect to assumption or
nonassumption of liability, including but not limited to assumption of all
obligations of the franchise and all moneys owed the city.
I. An assignment shall not relieve the former franchised MCS provider of
its financial liabilities and obligations to the city under the franchise
agreement unless specifically relieved by federal or state law (including
any applicable PSC rules and regulations) or unless specifically relieved
by the Council/franchising authority (or, where applicable, the PSC) at
the time an assignment is approved. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
A. Except as provided herein, an MCS provider may hypothecate its
multichannel system without prior formal approval of the Council/
franchising authority, provided that such hypothecation not include the
conveyance of any right of transfer assignment or acquisition of the
franchise without the further prior approval of the Council/franchising
authority. 70 [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
§ 185-108 TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 185-109
185:765
§ 185-110. Default of franchise.
B. While the Council/franchising authority will not unreasonably withhold
its consent of such hypothecation, it may nonetheless withhold approval
and consent in those instances where the technical or financial integrity
of the multichannel system would be compromised to such an extent
that the subscribers' ability to receive multichannel services would be
jeopardized.
A. When any event, act or omission (on the part of the franchised MCS
provider) occurs which represents a violation of a material provision of
this chapter or compromises the corporate character or legal, financial
or technical integrity and/or stability of the multichannel system or the
franchised MCS provider to such a degree that the interests of the
customers are negatively affected, then such event, act or omission may
be considered a major breach of this chapter. Under such
circumstances, the Council/franchising authority shall notify the
affected MCS provider in writing of the specific breach and direct such
franchised MCS provider to comply with all such provisions of its
franchise agreement or this chapter. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
B. For illustrative purposes only, the events, acts and omissions include,
but are not limited to, bankruptcy, insolvency, failure to pay taxes or
franchise fees (including the alternative user charge if applicable),
failure to receive written Council/franchising authority approval for an
assignment or failure to abide by the material terms and conditions of
the franchise agreement or material provisions of this chapter such as
cooperating with the city in the conduct of a periodic ascertainment of
the adequacy of the MCS provider's record of reasonably meeting
identified community needs, including those involving matters of
customer service and consumer protection needs as expressed by
subscribers. For purposes of this section, "material" means a provision
which either: [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
(1) Affects the ability of the customer to receive multichannel service;
(2) Affects the ability of the Council/franchising authority to receive
compensation for the use of its right-of-ways; or
(3) Affects the ability of the Council/franchising authority to evaluate
an MCS provider's performance in the technical, financial and legal
aspects of the multichannel system.
C. Where a franchised MCS provider satisfactorily corrects any of the
enumerated conditions within sixty (60) days, then in no event shall the
enumerated condition be weighed against such franchised MCS
provider in any subsequent review of franchise performance.
70.Editor's Note: Former Subsection B, which immediately followed this subsection and dealt
with where funds were to be expended, was repealed 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996. This
local law also renumbered former Subsection C as Subsection B.
§ 185-109 RYE CODE § 185-110
185:766
D. A copy of such notice of material breach shall be mailed to the surety on
the performance bond unless otherwise directed by state law (including
any applicable rule or regulation of the PSC). [Amended 5-29-1996 by
L.L. No. 4-1996]
E. Within seventy-five (75) days after such written notice is mailed to a
franchised MCS provider, the Council/franchising authority shall
conduct a public hearing on the matter unless state law or PSC rule or
regulation requires a different procedure in which the state or PSC rule
or regulation procedure would control or unless the alleged breach has
been corrected to the city's satisfaction. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
F. The Council/franchising authority shall provide written notice to a
franchised MCS provider and to the surety of the time and place of said
public hearing in a manner consistent with either state law or approved
by the Council/franchising authority (including, where necessary, the
PSC). [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
G. At the time of the hearing, the affected franchised MCS provider may
present information on the current status of the alleged breach of the
franchise agreement. If the situation has been resolved or steps are
being taken to resolve the situation, then the franchised MCS provider
should present the information at the hearing.
H. If the affected franchised MCS provider fails to attend the hearing and
has not requested a continuance of the hearing, then such franchised
MCS provider shall be deemed to have waived its right to a further
continuation of the matter and may be declared in default of the
franchise agreement unless the alleged breach has been corrected to
the city's satisfaction.
I. After the public hearing, the Council/franchising authority may
determine the franchised MCS provider to be in compliance and dismiss
the matter or may determine that the MCS provider has cured any
noncompliance and thereby dismiss the matter. However, the Council/
franchising authority may determine that a chapter violation exists and
remains uncured. Consequently, upon a finding that the MCS provider
violated an integral chapter provision or failed to cure an outstanding
chapter violation, the Council/franchising authority may direct the
affected franchised MCS provider to take corrective action within a
specified period of time or may declare such franchised MCS provider
in default of the franchise agreement and thereafter may revoke,
terminate or cancel the franchise, unless the franchised MCS provider
presents sufficient mitigating circumstances.
J. If the Council/franchising authority directs corrective action to take
place within a specified time or declares such franchised MCS provider
in default of the franchise agreement, then that declaration shall be
reduced to writing, and the notice of corrective action or default shall

§ 185-111. Performance evaluations.
The Council/franchising authority is authorized to design a performance
evaluation procedure which periodically monitors compliance of the
franchised MCS provider with the terms and conditions of both the
franchise and this chapter. Moreover, the Council/franchising authority may
periodically review and examine whether a franchised MCS provider's
financial, technical, legal and character qualifications and its record of
meeting community and subscriber needs as particularly relate to matters
of customer service practices and consumer protection issues continue to
meet required operational, maintenance and performance levels in order
to ensure the uninterrupted and acceptable provision of multichannel
services. Such performance evaluations may be conducted every three (3)
years during the franchise term and may be done as part of any annual
independent survey which may be required or conducted by the Council/
franchising authority.

be mailed to such franchised MCS provider and surety within twentyone
(21) days of the Council/franchising authority's action.
K. If within sixty (60) days the affected franchised MCS provider or surety
does not take significant action to rectify the breach or submit a plan
detailing how the affected MCS provider will eliminate the breach, then
the Council/franchising authority shall revoke such MCS provider's
franchise and shall notify the affected franchised MCS provider and
surety forthwith, unless there are mitigating circumstances.
L. The Council/franchising authority reserves the right to assess any
charges incurred (including costs for consultants, witnesses and
hearing preparation) in a default and/or revocation proceeding to the
franchised MCS provider.
A. In addition to any requirements contained within this chapter, all MCS
providers that are classified as cable operators shall be expected to
abide by and comply with all applicable provisions of the Cable Act, as
amended. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
B. The specific provisions of the Cable Act include, but are not limited to,
the following:
§ 185-110 RYE CODE § 185-116
185:768
(1) Cable channels for public, educational or governmental use
(Section 611 of the Cable Act, codified at 47 U.S.C. § 531).
(2) Cable channels for commercial use (Section 612, 47 U.S.C. § 532).
(3) General franchise requirements (Section 621, 47 U.S.C. § 541).
(4) Franchise fees (Section 622, 47 U.S.C. § 542).
(5) Regulation of rates (Section 623, 47 U.S.C. § 543).71
(6) Modification of franchise obligations (Section 625, 47 U.S.C. § 545).
(7) Franchise renewal (Section 626, 47 U.S.C. § 546).
(8) Conditions of sale of a franchise (Section 627, 47 U.S.C. § 547).
(9) Subscriber privacy (Section 631, 47 U.S.C. § 551).
(10) Equal employment opportunity (Section 634, 47 U.S.C. § 554).
(11) All applicable safety and electrical codes. [Added 5-29-1996 by
L.L. No. 4-1996]
C. Further, as an additional requirement, before the third anniversary of
the effective date of this chapter, any MCS provider classified as a
"cable operator" and providing cable service within the city shall design
and activate a multichannel system with a minimum capability of
providing seventy-seven (77) full-time video programming services.
D. Further, the Council/franchising authority is committed that the goal of
the Cable Act, as set forth in Section 601(4) of the Act [codified at 47
USC § 521 (4)], is met at all times. As a result, the Council/franchising
authority expressly requires that upon the advent, implementation and
transmission of high definition television (HDTV), its functional
equivalent or any subsequently developed technological advancement
affecting channel capacity or needed bandwidth for any video
programming source or service, the MCS provider classified as a "cable
operator" shall not lessen, dilute or decrease the mix, level, quality or
quantity of programming services carried on the multichannel system
for reasons of lack of adequate channel capacity, except to the extent
permitted pursuant to the applicable provisions of federal law.
[Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996]
E. Notwithstanding the above subsections of this section and where
specifically included or referenced in the Cable Act or by FCC
interpretation of the Cable Act, all MCS providers classified as "SMATV
operators" shall be expected to abide by and comply with such included
or referenced sections of the Cable Act, as amended.
71.Editor's Note: Former Subsection B(5), which immediately followed this subsection and
dealt with Section 624, 47 U.S.C. § 544, was repealed 5-29-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996. This
local law also renumbered former Subsections B(7) through B(11) as B(6) through B(10),
respectively.
§ 185-116 TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 185-117
185:769
§ 185-117. Public, educational and governmental use.
A. The Council/franchising authority recognizes that under Section 611 of
the Cable Act (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 531) the Council/franchising
authority has certain power with respect to certain aspects for public,
educational or governmental (PEG) use that is provided by MCS
providers classified as "cable operators."
B. To the extent permitted by law and in order to fulfill the Council/
franchising authority's desired goal of a public, educational and
governmental (PEG) access policy that will facilitate the long-range
needs of the city, the Council/franchising authority adopts the following:
(1) At the time of an initial or renewal application for an MCS franchise
for a cable system, an MCS provider classified as a "cable operator"
shall pledge to include the following guaranties:
(a) An MCS provider classified as a "cable operator" shall provide,
at its own expense, a dedicated public access channel.
(b) An MCS provider classified as a "cable operator" shall provide,
at its own expense, a dedicated educational access channel.
(c) An MCS provider classified as a "cable operator" shall provide,
at its own expense, a dedicated governmental channel.
(2) Both the Council/franchising authority and the affected franchisee
shall review use after every twenty-four (24) months, including the
percentage of use of every PEG channel. At the end of each twentyfour-
month period, the Council/franchising authority or its
designee shall evaluate the response and actual use of such
channels. If, after any twenty-four-month period, the percentage of
use for any required PEG channel drops below twenty-five percent
(25%) of the total time allocated, then the required number of
hours may be reduced to a number that most closely approximates
the average hours of use per day. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
(3) If a separate channel is not dedicated for either government or
educational use at any time and thereafter seventy-five percent
(75%) of the total time allocated for any combined required
government/educational channel is consistently used five (5) days a
week for a period of three (3) months, then the franchisee shall
provide an additional PEG channel. [Amended 5-29-1996 by L.L.
No. 4-1996]
(4) The franchisee may be required, pursuant to the provisions of the
negotiated franchise agreement which is in effect, to provide
mobile, portable and stationary equipment dedicated for PEG
access, together with the aid of technical and production assistance
provided by the franchisee. The provisions of such a franchise
agreement, to the extent consistent with applicable federal law,

may also provide that a franchisee shall provide equipment that
can store programs for delayed cablecasting, that there will be
no cost for technical production assistance for city PEG access
users and that the cost of maintenance of such PEG access studio
and equipment required to run the studio and other PEG access
facilities shall be borne by the franchisee. [Amended 5-29-1996
by L.L. No. 4-1996]
(5) The franchisee shall be permitted to use such PEG access channel
capacity required by this chapter for the provision of other services
if such channel capacity has not been used for the purposes
designated for a period of ninety (90) days and if the Council/
franchising authority agrees in advance. Such agreement may not
be unreasonably withheld. However, such use by the franchisee
shall cease if required to accommodate the designated PEG
program uses, subject to reasonable arrangements to avoid
untimely disruption of current program services and to allow
reasonable notice to subscribers. [Added 5-29-1996 by L.L. No.

not interfere with the use of such street, right-of-way, park or other public
place by the public and that such planting will enhance the beauty and
appearance of the street, right-of-way, park or other public place and the
surrounding area.

sum of money shall be returned after the work has been inspected by the
Tree Foreman, provided that he or she shall certify that said work is up to
standard. If it is not properly done, the Tree Foreman shall cause the work
to be completed to his or her satisfaction. After the completion of the work,
the Tree Foreman shall certify to the Comptroller the cost of completing the
work, and the surplus remaining after deducting such cost shall be returned

is prohibited from climbing trees with the aid of spurs. Any wires of public
utilities passing among the branches of City trees shall be properly
insulated so as to prevent damage to said trees. Guy wires shall not be
attached to trees in such a manner as to girdle or restrict growth. When
it is necessary to attach any guy wires or cables, such devices shall be
attached by means of lag hooks screwed into the trunks or by eyebolts
passing through the trunk.
§ 187-9. Removal of limbs.
When it is necessary to remove limbs to make clear passage for wires and
where the removal of such limbs might injure a tree or spoil its symmetry
or otherwise mar its appearance, it shall be necessary to obtain a permit
from the Department of Public Works before starting such work. It shall not
be necessary to secure a permit for the usual periodical removal of small
branches to allow the free passage of wires, but any such work will be

procedures under this Code. The Board of Architectural Review is
authorized and empowered to obtain the assistance, when necessary, of
persons especially qualified by reason of training or experience in tree
planting, preservation and landscaping.
B. Permits for the removal, cutting or destruction of trees may be granted
under the following circumstances:
(1) If the presence of the tree would cause hardship or endanger the
public or the person or the property of the owner or of an adjoining
owner.
(2) If a tree is diseased or threatens the health of other trees.
§ 187-10 TREES § 187-12
187:779
§ 187-13. Removal of branches overhanging highways.
Where privately owned trees encroach upon any street, right-of-way, park
or other public place, the Tree Foreman is authorized to remove branches
overhanging any public street, right-of-way, park or other public place, or if,
in his or her judgment, such trees are dangerous to the public, he or she is
authorized to remove them.
§ 187-14. Removal of dead trees.
Where any dead tree or trees located on private property adjacent to a
public street, right-of-way, park or other public place constitute a danger
or are potentially dangerous to the traveling public, the Tree Foreman may
serve personally or by mail upon the owner of said property a written notice
to remove the dead tree or trees, and upon failure to do so within 20 days
after the service of said notice, the City, through its contractors, agents or
employees, may remove the same and assess the cost thereof against the
property affected by said assessment, to be levied, collected and enforced in
the same manner as taxes upon said property for City purposes are levied,
collected and enforced.
§ 187-15. Prohibited use of City transfer station for trunks and
stumps.
It shall be unlawful for any person to place, deposit or dump on the City's
transfer station any trunks, limbs or branches of trees in excess of six inches
in diameter, and, further, it shall be unlawful to use said transfer station for
the deposit of tree stumps.
(3) If a tree substantially interferes with a permitted use of the
property.
C. Stop order. If the City Naturalist or Tree Foreman determines the
removal, cutting or destruction of trees for which a permit has been
granted is not proceeding according to the permit, the City Naturalist
or Tree Foreman may issue a stop order. Work will not resume until
approved corrective measures are undertaken.

Protected Trees
§ 187-16. Protected trees.
Trees designated as protected may not be removed unless the City
Naturalist determines, because of their condition, they are a danger to
persons or property or that they are diseased and cannot be saved. A tree
may be designated as protected by the Board of Architectural Review after
a public hearing. Such designation may be made because of the tree's age,
history, uniqueness or special beauty. No protected tree designation may be
made without the written consent of the tree's owner.

ARTICLE VI
Penalties for Offenses
§ 187-17. Penalties for offenses.
A. Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of this
chapter will be required to replace, in kind, each and every tree
removed, cut down or destroyed. If the tree was so large and mature
that it cannot be replaced, the City Naturalist may require the planting
of multiple trees. If multiple trees cannot be planted on the site of the
violation, other available planting spaces on public property will be
used to accommodate the balance of the penalty. No certificate of
occupancy shall be issued for any new construction on property on
which occurred any violation of this chapter unless and until the
provisions of this subsection have been complied with.
B. In addition to any other penalty, any person, firm or corporation or
individual hired by such firm or corporation violating any provision of
this chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty enforceable and
collectible by the City in the amount of $250 for each and every tree
removed, cut down or destroyed in violation of this chapter.
C. In addition to the foregoing, any person, firm or corporation engaged in
the business of tree removal or care who or which shall aid, assist or
abet in the violation of this chapter may be denied the status of a
permittee under § 187-12 for a reasonable period of time to ensure
future compliance, in the discretion of the City Naturalist, subject to
appeal to the City Manager.

Water Supply Emergencies
[Adopted 2-15-2017 by L.L. No. 3-201792]
§ 194-1. Statement of purpose.
The City of Rye purchases water from the New York-American Water
Company (hereinafter referred to as "Suez") and from Westchester Joint
Water Works (hereinafter "WJWW") (Suez and WJWW are hereinafter
referred to collectively as the "water companies"). From time to time,
the levels of the reservoirs will require the declaration of a water supply
emergency. When a water supply emergency is declared, there are certain
water use restrictions that must be implemented. Accordingly, the purposes
of this article are:
§ 194-2. Drought Response Plan.
The Drought Response Plan of the Connecticut-American and Suez
Companies, which plan was established on July 13, 1995, and subsequent

Manager declare the existence of a water supply emergency in one of
three possible phases in accordance with the Drought Response Plan.
B. Prior to any emergency, the water companies shall inform the City
Manager as early as practicable that a shortage of water may occur so
that the City and its residents are on notice.
C. If a water company determines that an emergency does exist, the water
company shall inform the City Manager of the emergency and ask that a
water emergency be declared. The water company shall provide notice
of its emergency in the designated official newspaper of the City of Rye
and by transmittal to the radio and television media in the territorial
areas serviced by it.
D. When a water supply emergency is declared by the City Manager, the
water company shall inform the City Manager at least once every month
as to the extent and length of the emergency. When the water company
determines that the precipitation is back to a safe level, the City

place.
A. Upon written application of any person, corporation or entity, the City
Manager may, in his or her discretion, grant an exemption and/or
variance relieving such person, corporation or entity from compliance
with the water use restrictions imposed on the basis of factors including
but not limited to any of the following:
(1) An undue hardship would otherwise result;
(2) No possible alternatives exist;
(3) The applicant has taken and will take all possible measures to
conserve water, with a complete description of such measures and
the water savings to be effected;
(4) Such exemption and/or variance is not inconsistent with the
purposes of this article; and/or
(5) The source and nature of the applicant's water supply.
B. In connection with any exemption and/or variance which may be
granted, the City Manager shall impose such terms and conditions as he
or she deems appropriate. Any variance and/or exemption granted shall
be fashioned to comport as strictly as possible with the intent of this
article.
C. The determination by the City Manager to grant or to deny an
exemption and/or variance from compliance with the water use
restrictions imposed may be appealed to the City Council. Upon receipt
of such an appeal, the City Council shall affirm, reverse or modify the

§ 195-1. Findings; intent; powers of Planning Commission.
A. Findings of fact.
(1) In their natural state, wetlands and watercourses serve multiple
functions, including:
(a) Protecting water resources by providing sources of surface
water, recharging groundwater and aquifers, serving as
chemical and biological oxidation basins and/or functioning as
settling basins for naturally occurring sedimentation.
(b) Controlling flooding and stormwater runoff by storing or
regulating natural flows.
(c) Providing nesting, migratory and wintering habitats for diverse
wildlife species, including many on the New York State and
federal endangered species lists.
(d) Supporting vegetative associations specifically adapted for
survival in low-oxygen environments and/or brackish water or
saltwater.
(e) Providing areas of unusually high plant productivity which
support significant wildlife diversity and abundance.
(f) Providing breeding and spawning grounds, nursery habitats
and food for various species of fish.
(g) Serving as nutrient traps for nitrogen and phosphorous and
filters for surface water pollutants.
(h) Helping to maintain biospheric stability by supporting
particularly efficient photosynthesizers capable of producing
significant amounts of oxygen and supporting bacteria which
process excess nitrates and nitrogenous pollutants and return
them to the atmosphere as inert nitrogen gas.
§ 194-7 RYE CODE § 195-1
187:836
(i) Providing open space and visual relief from intense
development in urbanized and growing areas and recreational
and aesthetic enjoyment for area residents.
(j) Serving as outdoor laboratories and living classrooms for the
study and appreciation of natural history, ecology and biology.
(2) Considerable acreage of these important natural resources has
been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating,
building, polluting and other acts inconsistent with the natural uses
of such areas. Remaining wetlands are in jeopardy of being lost,
despoiled or impaired by such acts contrary to the public safety and
welfare.
(3) It is therefore the policy of the City of Rye to protect its citizens,
including generations yet unborn, by preventing the despoilation
and destruction of wetlands and watercourses while taking into
account varying ecological, economic, recreational and aesthetic
values. Activities that may damage wetlands or watercourses
should be located on upland sites in such a manner as not to
degrade these systems.
B. Intent
(1) It is the intent of the City of Rye that activities in wetlands,
watercourses and wetland/watercourse buffers conform with all
applicable building codes, sediment control regulations and other
regulations and that such activities not threaten public safety, the
natural environment or cause nuisances by:
(a) Impeding stormwater and flood flows, reducing stormwater
and flood storage areas or destroying storm barriers, thereby
resulting in increased flood heights, frequencies or velocities
on other lands;
(b) Increasing water pollution through location of domestic waste
disposal systems in wet soils; inappropriate siting of
stormwater control facilities; unauthorized application of
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and algicides; disposal of
solid wastes at inappropriate sites; creation of unstabilized
fills; or the destruction of wetland soils and vegetation serving
pollution and sediment control functions;
(c) Increasing erosion;
(d) Decreasing breeding, nesting and feeding areas for many
species of waterfowl and shorebirds, including those rare and
endangered;
(e) Interfering with the exchange of nutrients needed by fish and
other forms of wildlife.
(f) Decreasing the habitat for fish and other forms of wildlife.
§ 195-1 TREES § 195-1
187:837
§ 195-2. Applicability to existing nonconforming uses.
(g) Adversely altering the recharge or discharge functions of
wetlands, thereby impacting groundwater or surface water
supplies;
(h) Significantly altering the wetland hydroperiod and thereby
causing either short or long-term changes in vegetational
composition, soils characteristics, nutrient cycling or water
chemistry;
(i) Destroying sites needed for education and scientific research,
such as outdoor biophysical laboratories, living classrooms and
training areas;
(j) Interfering with public rights in navigable waters and the
recreation opportunities provided by wetlands for fishing,
boating, hiking, bird watching, photography, camping and
other passive uses;
(k) Destroying or damaging aesthetic and property values,
including significant public viewsheds; or
(l) Allowing cumulative loss of wetlands or buffers through
incremental encroachment on wetland or buffer areas.
(2) The Planning Commission shall have the power to promulgate and
from time to time amend and repeal rules and regulations it deems
necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, after a public
hearing and subject to approval by the City Council. Copies of the
rules and regulations shall be filed with the City Clerk, the City
Conservation Commission/Advisory Council, the City Naturalist,
the City Planner and the City Building Inspector.
A. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to any land use,
improvement, development or activity legally existing on the effective
date of this chapter, including grounds maintenance and the application
of pesticides and fertilizers, subject to the following limitations:
(1) The land use, improvement, development or activity shall not be
expanded, changed, enlarged or altered in such a way that
increases its nonconformity without a permit.
(2) If destroyed, damaged or removed by any cause, water-dependent
and non-water-dependent land uses, improvements, developments
or activities legally existing on the effective date of this chapter
may be replaced, restored or reestablished in the same location
without a permit, provided that the replaced, restored or
reestablished uses, buildings, structures, features and other
development will not be closer to any wetland or watercourse or
result in a greater intensity of activity than before they were
§ 195-1 RYE CODE § 195-2
187:838
destroyed or damaged, and subject to the following additional
limitations:

Membership Club District, as defined in Chapter 197, Zoning,
of this Code, may be replaced, restored or reestablished only if
permitted by the Rye City Board of Appeals pursuant to
§ 197-5A(6) of this Code.
(c) Non-water-dependent land uses, improvements, development
or activity may be replaced, restored or reestablished,
provided that there will be no greater coverage of land than
before they were damaged or destroyed.

or activity granted a final approval and not completed prior to the
effective date of this chapter, subject to the following limitations:
(1) The land use, improvement, development or activity has
substantially commenced within one year of the effective date of
this chapter.
(2) The land use, improvement, development or activity shall not be
expanded, changed, enlarged or altered in such a way that
increases its nonconformity without a permit.
(3) For the purposes of this chapter, such land use, improvement,
development or activity, upon completion in accordance with its
final approval, shall thereafter be considered as existing on the
effective date of this chapter, and if destroyed, damaged or
removed by any cause, may not be reestablished, restored or used
except in accordance with the requirements of § 195-2A.
C. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to dams, floodgates and
sluices as were in existence on the effective date of this chapter or are
hereafter approved pursuant to the procedures provided for in this
chapter.
D. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to cemetery grave plots in
use or designated for future use as cemetery grave plots as of the
effective date of this chapter.
E. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the repair or
maintenance of existing utility facilities in existence on the effective

the field.
WETLAND/WATERCOURSE BUFFER  A specific area surrounding a
wetland/watercourse extending 100 feet horizontally away from and
paralleling the wetland/ watercourse boundary.
§ 195-4. Permit requirements; regulated activities; determining
wetland boundaries.
No regulated activity shall be conducted in a wetland, watercourse or
wetland/watercourse buffer without a written permit from the Planning
Commission and full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
applicable regulations. All activities that are not permitted as of right
or by permit shall be prohibited. The City Planner, City Engineer and
City Building Inspector shall, in the course of reviewing any application
before them, advise the applicant of the existence of this chapter and refer
information regarding such applications to the City Naturalist.
A. Wetlands and watercourses map  purpose and applicability.
(1) Purpose. Wetlands, watercourses and wetland/watercourse buffers
are defined in § 195-3 of this chapter and are generally indicated on
the Rye City Wetlands and Watercourses Map. The City of Rye
Wetlands and Watercourses Map is intended to provide general
guidance in locating and determining those areas which constitute
wetlands and watercourses, their boundaries and their related
buffers. Areas indicated as being wetlands, watercourses or
wetland/watercourse buffers may not actually be a wetland,
watercourse or wetland/ watercourse buffer and areas not
indicated as being a wetland, watercourse or wetland/watercourse
buffer may contain wetlands, watercourses and wetland/
watercourse buffers. The boundaries of wetlands and watercourses
and related buffers shall be delineated by the Planning Commission
or their consultant in the field.
(2) Applicability to activities requiring other city approvals. Areas
indicated as being wetlands, watercourses or wetland/watercourse
buffers may not actually be a wetland, watercourse or wetland/
watercourse buffer and areas not indicated as being a wetland,
watercourse or wetland/watercourse buffer may contain wetlands,
§ 195-3 TREES § 195-4
187:843
watercourses and wetland/watercourse buffers. Potential
applicants for permits required by this chapter and other city
approvals shall attach a copy of the determination from the City
Naturalist to their application. The granting of an approval by a
city agency or official pursuant to any other chapter of the Code
of the City of Rye or the granting of an approval by any state or
federal agency shall in no way excuse or exempt any person from
the requirements of this chapter even if the property is not shown
as being a wetland, watercourse or wetland/watercourse buffer on
the map. In the case of city official and agency approvals, such
officials and agencies shall, upon notification by the City Naturalist
that an activity also requires a permit pursuant to this chapter,
take such action as is necessary to stop any part of the work being
undertaken that is subject to regulation pursuant to this chapter
until a permit has been granted.
(3) Applicability to activities not requiring other city approvals. Areas
not indicated as being a wetland, watercourse or wetland/
watercourse buffer may contain wetlands, watercourses and
wetland/watercourse buffers subject to this chapter, but a permit
under this chapter can only be required upon a finding by the
Planning Commission that the area is a wetland, watercourse or
wetland/watercourse buffer. Such finding shall be in writing and
shall also authorize the City Naturalist to issue a stop-work order if
the Planning Commission finds that the activity has not been
substantially completed. Said finding must be approved by an
affirmative vote of at least five members of the Planning
Commission, and thereafter the Planning Commission shall
delineate the boundary of the wetland, watercourse and wetland/
watercourse buffer at the cost of the city and recommend an
amendment to the map for the purpose of future regulation. In the
event that the Planning Commission makes a finding that a
wetland, watercourse or wetland/watercourse buffer does exist but
does not authorize the City Naturalist to issue a stop-work order,
said activity shall be deemed to have been permitted as if a permit
had been issued. However, the Planning Commission, City
Naturalist and their agents or employees may thereafter, with the
owner's permission, enter upon said land to delineate the boundary
and seek an appropriate amendment to the map. If the owner of the
property bars such entry, the City Naturalist, Planning Commission
and their agents or employees are empowered to apply to the City
Court for an administrative search warrant permitting entry onto
said land to delineate the boundary and seek an appropriate
amendment to the map.
B. City Naturalist determination and appeals. [Amended 5-6-1992 by
L.L. No. 5-1992]
(1) City Naturalist's determination. The City Naturalist, in consultation
with the Conservation Commission/Advisory Council and the City
§ 195-4 RYE CODE § 195-4
187:844
Planner, shall, within five business days of receiving a written
request for a determination, determine if the proposed activity is
in an area that may be subject to the requirements of this chapter.
The written request for such determination must be accompanied
by a payment of a fee to the City of Rye. Such fee shall be set
annually by resolution of the City Council. The City Naturalist
shall make one of two possible determinations: that the area may
be subject to the requirements of this chapter or that the area
is not subject to the requirements of this chapter. In performing
this evaluation, the City Naturalist should consult the Rye City
Wetlands and Watercourses Map. In addition, the City Naturalist
may also consult the Westchester County Soil Survey Maps,
prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture Soil
Conservation Service, revised in 1986 and as further revised from
time to time, which show the approximate location of hydric soils
that indicate the potential presence of a wetland as defined in this
chapter, and may also consult the National List of Plant Species
That Occur in Wetlands: Northeast (Region 1), the list of upland
wetland plant species developed by the United States Department
of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service in cooperation with the
National and Regional Interagency Review Panels, as amended and
updated from time to time. The maps and list shall be available for
inspection in the City Naturalist's office and in the City Planner's
office. [Amended 12-17-1997 by L.L. No. 19-1997]
(2) Appeal of City Naturalist's determination that a property is not
subject to the requirements of this chapter. In the case of a
subdivision or site development plan application, a resident or
property owner in the City of Rye may petition the Planning
Commission to reverse a determination of the City Naturalist that a
property is not subject to the requirements of this chapter. The
petitioner shall have the burden of demonstrating that the City
Naturalist's determination should be reversed. Such petition must
be filed within 15 business days of the City Naturalist's
determination. Said petition shall be in the form set forth in the
Planning Commission's rules and regulations adopted pursuant to
this chapter.
(3) Appeal of City Naturalist's determination that a property may be
subject to the requirements of this chapter. If the City Naturalist
determines that an area may be subject to the requirements of this
chapter, the property owner may petition the Planning Commission
to determine that the area is not subject to the requirements of this
chapter. Said petition shall be in the form of the permit application
as set forth in § 195-5B, but the application need only provide the
data required under § 195-5B(2)(b) for a waiver. If additional
information is needed by the Planning Commission to decide the
petition, the petitioner shall provide said additional information.
The petitioner shall have the burden of demonstrating that the City
Naturalist's determination was incorrect. Such petition must be
§ 195-4 TREES § 195-4
187:845
filed within 15 business days of the City Naturalist's determination.
If the Planning Commission determines that the decision of the
City Naturalist was correct, the property owner may complete the
application by paying the permit application fee and submitting all
other required permit information or withdraw the application.
C. Regulated activities. Except as specified in § 195-4D, the following are
regulated activities when within a wetland, watercourse or wetland/
watercourse buffer and may be granted a permit upon written
application to the Planning Commission:
(1) Placement or construction of any structure.
(2) Any form of draining, dredging, excavation or removal of material
either directly or indirectly.
(3) Any form of dumping, filling or depositing of material either
directly or indirectly.
(4) Installation of any service lines or cable conduits.
(5) Introduction of any form of pollution, including but not limited to
the installation of a septic tank, the running of a sewer outfall or
the discharging of sewage treatment effluent or other liquid waste
into or so as to drain into a wetland.
(6) Alteration or modification of natural features and contours.
(7) Alteration or modification of natural drainage patterns.
(8) Construction of dams, docks or other water-control devices, pilings
or bridges, whether or not they change the natural drainage
characteristics.
(9) Installation of any pipes or wells.
(10) Clear-cutting any area of trees.
(11) Removal or cutting of any vegetation, except selective cutting as
permitted in § 195-4D(2).
(12) Deposition or introduction of organic or inorganic chemicals,
including pesticides and fertilizers.
(13) Any agricultural activity which involves the draining or excavation
of a wetland, except as permitted in § 195-4D(7).
(14) Any other activity that may impair the natural function(s) of a
wetland as described in § 195-1 of this chapter.
D. Uses as of right  no permit required. The following uses shall be
allowed as of right within a wetland, watercourse or wetland/
watercourse buffer without a permit to the extent that they are not
prohibited by any other chapter and to the extent that they do not
§ 195-4 RYE CODE § 195-4
187:846
§ 195-5. Permit standards and procedures.
constitute a pollution or erosion hazard or interfere with proper
drainage:
(1) Normal ground maintenance, including mowing, trimming of
vegetation and removal of dead or diseased vegetation.
(2) Selective cutting as defined in § 195-3.
(3) Repair of existing structures, including interior renovations,
walkways, walls and docks.
(4) Decorative landscaping and planting in wetland/watercourse
buffers, excluding those activities regulated in § 195-4C(11) and
(12).
(5) Public health activities, orders and regulations of the Westchester
County Department of Health and/or the New York State
Department of Health for emergencies only.
(6) Deposition or removal of natural products of wetlands in the
process of recreational or commercial fishing, shellfishing,
aquaculture, hunting or trapping, but excluding excavation and
removal of peat or timber, except as provided in § 195-4C(2).
(7) Agricultural activities as defined in § 195-3.
(8) Normal beach maintenance, including restoration of an eroded
shoreline to its original state.
E. Rules for determining boundaries. The Planning Commission shall
determine the boundaries of a wetland or watercourse. The boundaries
of a wetland ordinarily shall be determined by field investigation. In so
doing the Planning Commission may consult and/or may require the
applicant to consult with qualified biologists, hydrologists, soil
scientists, ecologists/botanists/zoologists or other experts as necessary
to make this determination. After the boundary has been determined by
the Planning Commission, it may require, at the expense of the
applicant, a survey to be drawn up by a licensed land surveyor.
A. Procedures for permits.
(1) No regulated activity shall be conducted without issuance of a
written permit from the Planning Commission.
(2) All permits shall expire on completion of the acts specified and,
unless otherwise indicated, shall be valid for a period of one year
from the date of issue. A one-year extension of an original permit
may be granted upon written request to the Planning Commission
by the original permit holder or his/her legal agent at least 90 days
prior to the expiration date of the original permit. The Planning
Commission may require new hearings if, in its judgment, the
§ 195-4 TREES § 195-5
187:847
original scope of the permit is altered or extended by the renewal
or if the applicant has failed to abide by the terms of the original
permit in any way. The request for renewal of a permit shall follow
the same form and procedure as the original application, except
that the Planning Commission shall have the option of not holding a
hearing if the original scope of the permit is not altered or extended
in any significant way.
B. Permit applications.
(1) Application for a permit shall be made to the Planning Commission
on forms furnished by the City Planner pursuant to the Planning
Commission's rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this
chapter.
(2) An application for a permit shall not be deemed complete if it does
not include all of the information required by the Planning
Commission's rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this
chapter and the following:
(a) The application fee.
(b) Complete plans and estimates as set forth in the Planning
Commission's rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this
chapter. In the case of applications for projects where the total
amount of disturbed area is less than one-fourth acre or
projects whose total cost does not exceed $10,000 or projects
which propose encroachment into the wetland/watercourse
buffer only, the Planning Commission may waive the
requirements for complete plans and estimates set forth in its
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter,
provided that a plan clearly showing the extent and details of
the project has been submitted with the application.
(c) Evidence that the applicant has complied fully with the
procedures of the State Environmental Quality Review Act
(Article 8 of the New York State Environmental Conservation
Law) and has submitted a full environmental assessment form,
except that a short environmental assessment form may be
submitted at the discretion of the Planning Commission.
(3) The Planning Commission may require additional information as
needed, such as the study of flood, erosion or other hazards at the
site and the effect of any protective measures that might be taken
to reduce such hazards and other information deemed necessary to
evaluate the proposed use in terms of the goals and standards of
this chapter.
(4) By filing an application, the applicant thereby consents to the entry
onto his land by the City Naturalist, City Planner or other agents
designated by the Planning Commission for the purpose of
undertaking any investigation, examination, survey or other
§ 195-5 RYE CODE § 195-5
187:848
activity necessary for the purposes of this chapter. If the owner
of the property bars such entry, the City Naturalist, Planning
Commission and their agents or employees are empowered to apply
to the City Court for an administrative search warrant permitting
such inspection.
C. Public hearings and public notification by applicant. [Amended
3-10-2010 by L.L. No. 4-201093]
(1) When an activity subject to regulation under this chapter also
requires Planning Commission approval pursuant to another
chapter of the Code of the City of Rye, the requirements for public
hearings and public notification by the applicant shall be the same
as required for the other approval. When the only other approval
involves Chapter 73, Coastal Zone Management Waterfront
Consistency Review, the requirements below shall apply. When an
activity subject to regulation under this chapter does not also
require Planning Commission approval pursuant to another
chapter of the Code of the City of Rye and, in the case of Chapter
73, Coastal Zone Management Waterfront Consistency Review,
before the Planning Commission acts on the application, it shall
hold a public hearing. The applicant shall provide additional public
notification in accordance with the public notification requirements
set forth in the Planning Commission's rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to this chapter. All public notifications must be
mailed via certified mail with a certificate of mailing. At least five
days prior to the public hearing, all certificates of mailing must be
turned into the Planning Commission.
(2) Insofar as possible, any public hearing on the application shall be
integrated with any public hearing required or otherwise held
pursuant to any other law, including the State Environmental
Quality Review Act, and only one public notice need be prepared,
provided that the notice contains all of the information required for
each hearing.
(3) Any party may present evidence and testimony at the hearing. At
the hearing, the applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating
that the proposed activity will be in accord with the goals and
policies of this chapter and the standards set forth in § 195-5D.
D. Standards for permit decisions.
(1) In granting, denying or conditioning any permit, the Planning
Commission shall evaluate wetland functions and the role of the
wetland in the hydrologic and ecological system and shall
determine the impact of the proposed activity upon public health
and safety, rare and endangered species, water quality and
additional wetland functions listed in § 195-1 of this chapter.
93.Editor's Note: This local law provided that it shall take effect 5-1-2010.
§ 195-5 TREES § 195-5
187:849
Impacts and losses shall be avoided to the maximum extent
practicable or, if they cannot be avoided, they shall be minimized
to the maximum extent practicable. In this determination, it shall
consider the following factors and shall issue written findings with
respect to those factors which are applicable:
(a) The impact of the proposed activity and existing and
reasonably anticipated similar activities upon neighboring land
uses and wetland functions as set forth in § 195-1 of this
chapter, including but not limited to the following:
[1] The filling in of a wetland or other modification of natural
topographic contours.
[2] Disturbance or destruction of natural flora and fauna.
[3] Influx of sediments or other materials causing increased
water turbidity and/or substrate aggradation.
[4] Removal or disturbance of wetland soils.
[5] Reductions in wetland water supply.
[6] Interference with wetland water circulation.
[7] Damaging reduction or increases in wetland nutrients.
[8] Influx of toxic chemicals and/or heavy metals.
[9] Damaging thermal changes in the wetland water supply.
[10] Destruction of natural aesthetic values.
(b) Any existing wetland impacts and the cumulative effect of
reasonably anticipated future wetland activities in the wetland
subject to the application.
(c) The impact of the proposed activity and reasonably anticipated
similar activities upon flood flows, flood storage, storm barriers
and water quality.
(d) The safety of the proposed activity from flooding, erosion,
hurricane winds, soil limitations and other hazards and
possible losses to the applicant and subsequent purchasers of
the land.
(e) The adequacy of water supply and waste disposal for the
proposed uses.
(f) Consistency with federal, state, county and local
comprehensive land use plans and regulations.
(g) The availability of preferable alternative locations on the
subject parcel or, in the case of activity which cannot be
§ 195-5 RYE CODE § 195-5
187:850
undertaken on the property without disturbance to wetlands,
the availability of other reasonable locations for the activity.
(2) The Planning Commission shall deny a permit if:
(a) It finds that it will threaten public health and safety, result in
fraud, cause nuisances, impair public rights to the enjoyment
and use of public waters, threaten a rare or endangered plant
or animal species, violate pollution control standards or violate
other federal, state or local regulations; or
(b) It finds that both the affected landowner and the City of Rye
have been notified by a duly filed notice, in writing, that the
state or any agency or political subdivision of the state is in the
process of acquiring the wetland by negotiation or
condemnation with the following provisions:
[1] The written notice must include an indication that the
acquisition process has commenced, such as that an
appraisal of the property has been prepared or is in the
process of being prepared.
[2] If the landowner receives no offer for the property within
one year of the permit denial, this ban to the permit lapses.
If its negotiations with the applicant are broken off, the
state or any agency or the City of Rye must, within six
months of the end of negotiation, either issue its findings
and determination to acquire the property pursuant to
§ 204 of the Eminent Domain Procedure Law or issue a
determination to acquire the property without public
hearing pursuant to § 206 of the Eminent Domain
Procedure Law or this ban to permit lapses.
(3) Special consideration will be given to activities that must have a
shoreline or wetland location in order to function and that will have
as little impact as possible upon the wetland, watercourse and
wetland/watercourse buffer. In general, permission will not be
granted for dredging or ditching solely for the purpose of draining
wetlands, controlling mosquitoes, lagooning, constructing
factories, providing spoil and dump sites or building roadways that
may be located elsewhere.
E. Replacement/compensation plan requirements.
(1) Where losses of wetlands or impacts on wetlands are deemed
unavoidable by the Planning Commission, the Commission may
require the applicant to develop a replacement/compensation plan
which shall specify measures that provide for replacement
wetlands that re-create as nearly as possible the original wetlands
in terms of type, function, geographic location and setting. On-site
replacement/compensation shall be the preferred approach; off-site
replacement/compensation shall be permitted only in cases where
§ 195-5 TREES § 195-5
187:851
an on-site alternative is not possible. In the case of applications
for projects where the total amount of wetland or buffer area is
disturbed is less than 2,000 square feet, the Planning Commission
may waive or modify the requirements outlined in this subsection.
(2) Replacement/compensation plans developed to compensate for the
loss of wetlands shall include the baseline data set forth in the
Planning Commission's rules and regulations adopted pursuant to
this chapter, as deemed necessary by the Planning Commission.
(3) The Planning Commission shall monitor or shall cause to have
monitored projects, according to the specifications set forth in the
permit, to determine whether the elements of the plan and permit
conditions have been met and whether the wetland acreage
created replaces the wetland acreage lost. To this end, the Planning
Commission may contract with an academic institution, an
independent research group or other qualified professionals, at the
expense of the applicant, or may use its own staff expertise. The
requirements for monitoring shall be specified in the plan and shall
include but not be limited to the requirements set forth in the
Planning Commission's rules and regulations adopted pursuant to
this chapter.
(4) Any plan prepared pursuant to this section and accepted by the
Planning Commission shall become part of the permit for the
application.
F. Permit conditions.
(1) Any permit issued pursuant to this chapter may be issued with
conditions. Such conditions may be attached as the Planning
Commission deems necessary and pursuant to § 195-5D to assure
the preservation and protection of affected wetlands and to assure
compliance with the policy and provisions of this chapter and the
provisions of the Planning Commission's rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to this chapter.
(2) Every permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall be in written
form and shall contain the standard conditions and may contain the
optional conditions set forth in the Planning Commission's rules
and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter.
G. Performance bond. A bond shall be posted with the Planning
Commission by the applicant, prior to the issuance of a permit, to
secure to the city the satisfactory installation and maintenance of
structures and devices necessary to ensure protection of the wetland,
watercourse and wetland/watercourse buffer during construction and
satisfactory installation of permanent structures and devices necessary
to ensure protection of the wetland, watercourse and wetland/
watercourse buffer, which shall be in an amount equal to the cost to
install and maintain said structures and devices during construction
and the cost to install said permanent structures and devices, except as
§ 195-5 RYE CODE § 195-5
187:852
waived or reduced by the Planning Commission. The bond shall be
released by the Planning Commission upon completion of the work
permitted by said permit, provided that said work is found to be in
accordance with the provisions of the permit and such other ordinances
as may apply and is completed to the satisfaction of the City Naturalist
or other city officials responsible for the enforcement of such city
ordinances. If the city finds that said installation and maintenance is not
being done by the applicant or is not satisfactory and the applicant fails
to correct the situation in the time period specified by the city, the city
may proceed against the bond in order to correct for any deficiencies.
Not less than 10% of the bond shall be in cash.
H. Other laws and regulations. No permit or waiver granted pursuant to
this chapter shall remove an applicant's obligation to comply in all
respects with the applicable provisions of any other federal, state or
local law or regulation, including but not limited to the acquisition of
any other required permit or approval, including but not limited to the
New York State Tidal Wetlands Regulations, New York State
Freshwater Wetlands Regulations and New York State Coastal Erosion
Management Regulations.94
I. Stop-work order.
(1) A stop-work order may be issued if the applicant or permittee has
not complied with any or all of the terms of such permit, has
exceeded the authority granted in the permit or has failed to
undertake the project in the manner set forth in the approved
application.
(2) If a stop-work order is issued it shall be set forth in writing, a copy
of which shall be filed with the Planning Commission, and shall
contain the finding and reasons for issuing the stop-work order
pursuant to this section.
(3) A stop-work order shall be issued when authorized by the Planning
Commission pursuant to § 195-4A(3).
J. Consultants and related fees. [Added 10-8-1997 by L.L. No.
14-1997]
(1) The Planning Commission in the review of any application may
refer such application to such engineering, planning, legal,
technical or environmental consultant or other professionals,
hereinafter referred to as "consultant or consultants," as it deems
reasonably necessary to enable it to review such application as
required by law, provided that the required expertise is not
available from city staff, and subject to the following:
94.Editor's Note: See the Environmental Conservation Law, §§ 25-0101 et seq., 24-0101 et
seq. and 34-0101 et seq., respectively.

Planner. The Planning Commission shall review the services
and costs with the applicant at its next regular meeting
following receipt of the request.
(c) The City Planner shall authorize the consultant to proceed if
he/she has not received a written request for a review of the
consultant's services and costs from the applicant within seven
days of the applicant's receipt of the City Planner's transmittal.
The receipt date is the date shown as received on the return
receipt card returned by the post office.
(d) The applicant shall pay the consultant's fee upon receipt of the
consultant's detailed statement for the services provided. The
statement will be forwarded to the applicant by the City

be by check made payable to the consultant and shall be
submitted to the City Planner for transmittal to the consultant.
(g) This Subsection J shall expire two years after the date of its
adoption, unless specifically reenacted by the City Council.
§ 195-5 RYE CODE § 195-6
187:854
activity subject to regulation under this chapter also requires Planning
Commission approval pursuant to another chapter of the Code of the City
of Rye. When the only other approval involves Chapter 73, Coastal Zone
Management Waterfront Consistency Review, the requirements described
below shall apply. When an activity subject to regulation under this chapter
does not also require Planning Commission approval pursuant to another
chapter of the Code of the City of Rye and in the case of an activity
regulated under this chapter and only Chapter 73, Coastal Zone
Management Waterfront Consistency Review, the Conservation
Commission/Advisory Council shall report back to the Planning Commission
within 20 days of the date of the referral by the City Planner. Failure to reply
within the specified time period may be deemed as indicating no objections
to the application. In cases where Planning Commission determinations
under this chapter are not consistent with the Conservation Commission/
Advisory Council report, the Planning Commission shall issue written
findings detailing the basis for their determination in variance with the
Conservation Commission/Advisory Council report. The City Planner shall
provide a copy of the proposed permit decisions and conditions to the
Chairman of the Conservation Commission/Advisory Council concurrent
with distribution of such proposed permit decisions and conditions to the
Planning Commission.
§ 195-7. Penalties for offenses.
§ 195-8. Enforcement.
The City Naturalist shall be the enforcement officer for this chapter. No
work or activity subject to review under this chapter shall be commenced
A. Civil sanctions. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this
chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than $3,000 for
every such violation. Each consecutive day of violation will be
considered a separate offense. Such civil penalty may be released or
compromised by the Planning Commission. In addition, the Planning
Commission shall have power, following a hearing, to direct the violator
to restore the affected wetland to its condition prior to the violation,
insofar as that is possible.
B. Criminal sanctions. Any person, firm or corporation who willfully
violates any of the provisions of this chapter or permits promulgated
thereunder, excluding provisions set forth in the rules and regulations

permit is disapproved, the reasons for such action shall be stated on
the records of the Planning Commission and a copy of such reasons
will be sent to the applicant. If the permit is approved, it shall not be
signed by the approved officers of the Planning Commission until the
applicant has met all the conditions of the action granting approval of
such permit.
A. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the City of Rye's
authority concerning the placement, construction and modification of
wireless telecommunications facilities. The City Council finds that
wireless telecommunications facilities and related equipment may pose
a unique hazard to the health, safety, public welfare and environment of
the City and its inhabitants, and may also have adverse visual and sonic
impacts on the community, its character and thus the quality of life in
the City.
B. By enacting this chapter, the City intends to:
(1) Ensure that the placement, construction or modification of wireless
telecommunications facilities and related equipment is consistent
with the City's land use policies and Zoning Code95;
(2) Minimize the negative and adverse visual and aesthetic impacts of
wireless telecommunications facilities to the maximum extent
practicable through careful design, siting, landscaping, screening
and innovative camouflaging techniques;
(3) Assure a comprehensive review of environmental impacts of such
facilities;
(4) Protect the health, safety and welfare of the City of Rye;
(5) Account for when shared use of wireless telecommunication
facilities is the more aesthetically sensitive alternative;

intent of this chapter, the Council creates a special use permit for wireless
telecommunications facilities for the purpose of achieving the following
goals:
§ 196-5. Special use permit, special exception permits and eligible
facility permits.
A. Implementing an application process for person(s) seeking a special use
permit or special exception permit for a wireless telecommunications
facility.
B. Establishing a policy for examining an application for and issuing
special use permits and special exception permits for wireless
telecommunications facilities that is both fair and consistent.
C. Establishing timeframes for granting or not granting a special use
permits and special exception permits for wireless telecommunications
facilities, or recertifying or revoking the special use permit or special
exception permit granted under this chapter.
D. Promoting and encouraging, wherever possible, but only where it will
result in the least overall visual and sonic impact for residential
dwelling units, the collocation of wireless telecommunications facilities.
E. Promoting and encouraging, wherever possible, the placement of a
wireless telecommunications facility in such a manner as to cause
minimal disruption to the land, property, buildings and other facilities
adjacent to, surrounding and in generally the same area as the
requested location of such a wireless telecommunications facility and to
minimize adverse visual, sonic, and aesthetic impacts to the community
and risk of adverse impacts to community character and property value.
A. All wireless telecommunications facilities within the City must comply
with this chapter and all other applicable law and regulations. A person
who installs wireless telecommunications facilities pursuant to this
section must comply with all safety codes; comply with requirements
for RF emissions; and must utilize concealment elements and maintain
facilities to minimize visibility of the wireless telecommunications
facilities. All wireless telecommunications facilities are subject to the
§ 196-3 RYE CODE § 196-5
187:864
registration requirements of Section 167.72, if applicable, regardless of
their status under, or the applicability of, this chapter.
B. This chapter does not apply to any device designed for end-user overthe-
air reception, not transmission, of television broadcast signals,
multichannel multipoint distribution service, or direct broadcast
satellite service; or for end user reception of signals from an Internet
service provider and end user transmission of signals to an Internet
service provider.
C. All wireless telecommunications facilities (including modifications), or
construction, modification or replacement of support structures in
connection with the installation of wireless telecommunications
facilities must be permitted by a special use permit, special exception
permit or eligible facility permit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
following wireless telecommunications facilities do not require a special
use permit, except where the same are on, substantially contiguous to,
or affect a historic structure, or an environmentally sensitive area.
Requirements that may apply to the underlying supporting structure to
which a base station is to be attached, as well as all other applicable
laws and regulations continue to apply. Such wireless
telecommunications facilities that do not require a special use permit
shall require a special exception permit and pay the associated fee to
the City Manager or his/her designee. Such wireless
telecommunications facilities shall be authorized to be installed on
condition that any and all other required permits or approvals have
been received.
(1) Wireless telecommunications facilities that are less than one cubic
feet in size create no measurable sound and are placed on existing
supporting structures without increasing the physical dimensions
of the existing supporting structures. The "cubic footage" takes into
account all the elements of the wireless telecommunications facility
(including accessory facilities or structures).
(2) Wireless telecommunications facilities placed on the rooftop of
nonresidential structures; that make no measurable sound beyond
the rooftop; that are at least 40 feet from any residential unit; and
that include some concealment elements so that the wireless
telecommunications facilities are not visible from the street.
(3) Wireless telecommunications facilities within existing supporting
structures (other than historical structures) that are not visible
from and that do not create any sound greater than 10 db(A)
measured at the source from outside the supporting structure and
do not change the physical dimensions or appearance of the
supporting structure within which they are placed.
(4) Carriers on wheels where the placement is permitted, and complies
with, applicable FCC regulations for temporary placement of
wireless telecommunications facilities.
§ 196-5 TREES § 196-5
187:865
(5) Routine maintenance, or replacement of elements of a wireless
telecommunications facility or supporting structure that do not
change the dimensions, visibility, or audibility of a wireless
telecommunications facility or supporting structure.
(6) Micro wireless facilities.
D. The City Manager or his/her designee shall prepare application forms
that must be used by persons seeking to place wireless
telecommunications facilities in the City and which shall require
additional submission of at least the information required by the City
Code, and may require information that the City may consider in acting
upon an application.
(1) Franchise required. In addition to the special use permit, special
exception permit and eligible facilities permit required herein, the
placement of a wireless telecommunications facility in the public
rights-of-way requires the persons who will own or control those
facilities to obtain a franchise or permit to be located within the
City's right-of-way, unless that person holds a franchise from the
state which authorizes it to use the right-of-way for that purpose,
without further permission of the City. Pursuant to Chapter 167,
"Streets and Sidewalks," such franchise or permit may be approved
by the City.
E. As part of the administration of this article, the City Council may adopt
by simple majority vote regulations governing the placement and
modification of wireless telecommunications facilities consistent with
the requirements of this article, including regulations governing
collocation and resolution of conflicting applications for placement of
wireless telecommunications facilities, and guidelines for placement of
wireless telecommunications facilities on City-owned or controlled
structures in the rights-of-way.
(1) Develop acceptable designs for wireless telecommunications
facilities in particular corridors, taking into account the zoning
districts bounding the rights-of-way;
(2) The City Manager shall issue any notices of incompleteness,
requests for information, or conduct or commission such studies as
may be required to determine whether a permit should be issued. If
the City Manager issues a notice of incompleteness, any applicable
timeframes to review the application shall be reinitiated upon the
delivery of the missing material as if the application was received
anew as described in § 196-6C.
(3) The City Manager shall develop forms and procedures for
submission of applications for placement or modification of
wireless telecommunication facilities, and proposed changes to any
support structure consistent with this article.

187:866
F. For eligible facilities requests, as defined in the Federal
Communications regulation 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(3), implementing
federal law, 47 U.S.C. § 1455, an eligible facility permit is required prior
to installation (including modifications) of wireless telecommunications
facilities or modification of existing support structures in connection
with the installation of wireless telecommunications facilities.
(1) An eligible facility permit may be issued administratively by the
City Engineer and Corporation Counsel jointly after all applicable
safety and fire code regulations have been complied with. The
eligible facility permit shall specifically provide that it is being
issued at the direction of the federal government and without the
consent of the City and shall be of no further force and effect when
the permit for the underlying facility expires, or the federal law
changes so that the permit as issued is no longer required.
(2) The application for any eligible facility permit must contain at least
the information required to permit the City Manager and
Corporation Counsel to determine that the application is an eligible
facilities request, including (i) the underlying approval for the
existing tower and base station; (ii) any approved modifications to
the same where the modifications were approved prior to February
22, 2012; and (iii) detailed information about the physical
dimensions of tower and base station as the same exist on the date
of the application, and as proposed to be modified.
(3) The application shall be denied if it is not an eligible facilities
request or if all the information required under § 196-6V is not
submitted. If an application is denied because it is determined that
it is not an eligible facilities request, the applicant may request that
the application be treated as a request for special permit by
submitting all the information required for a special permit within
10 days of the denial of application. The applicant has the burden of
proof in all aspects of its permit request by providing clear and
convincing evidence.
G. All other wireless telecommunications facility installations (including
modifications), or construction, modification or replacement of support
structures in connection with the installation of wireless
telecommunications facilities require a special use permit or special
exception permit.
(1) Special use permits and special exception permits may be granted
where applicant shows by clear and convincing evidence:
(a) The wireless telecommunications facility proposed is not being
built speculatively (that is, there is a customer for the wireless
telecommunications facility), and it will be built and used
promptly upon approval.
(b) The applicant is a utility under New York law or a provider
described in Subsection G(1)(e) below or a governmental
§ 196-5 TREES § 196-5
187:867
entity. The applicant and any entity whose equipment would be
included in the installations has all the authorizations required
to place the wireless telecommunications facilities from the
state, or the City (other than the special use permit requested),
or the owner of the property, and to modify, replace or attach
to a supporting structure, and the placement, construction
and operation of the wireless telecommunications facilities
(including supporting structures) will be in compliance with all
applicable laws.
(c) The wireless telecommunications facility is designed and

(e) If applicant is confirmed to be a utility under New York law or
is confirmed to be a provider, as described below, it must
demonstrate that the wireless telecommunications facility is
necessary for the provision of services. All applicants must
show that the proposed installation is the least intrusive
alternative for providing service. If the applicant is a provider
of wireless services or facilities under 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7), it
must show that absent approval, there will be a prohibition in
the provision of wireless services within the meaning of federal
law.
(2) City may approve a special use permit or special exception permit
without the showing required by Subsection G(1)(e) where the
facility is not located in or does not affect historic structures or
environmentally sensitive areas and the wireless
telecommunications facility:
(a) Is a stealth facility that otherwise satisfies the provisions of
this chapter.
(b) Contains concealment elements, and is to be placed or shielded
on an existing supporting structure in such a way such that the
wireless telecommunications facility produces no measureable
sound greater than 10 db(A) and is not readily visible to,
surrounding properties, and is not subject to modification
except at the discretion of the City.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, City may require the showing
under Subsection G(1)(e) where the City determines installation or
modification of the wireless telecommunications facility
substantially alters the size, proportions or dimensions of an
existing supporting structure.
§ 196-5 RYE CODE § 196-5
187:868
(4) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the City
Council may for reasonable cause and based on substantial
evidence exempt any applicant from any requirement of this
chapter or require the location or character of a wireless
telecommunications facility to be other than that which this
chapter might otherwise mandate.
(5) Prohibited on certain structures. No wireless telecommunications
facility shall be located on single-family detached residences,
single-family attached residences, two-family residences, or any
residential accessory structure.
H. General standards for wireless telecommunications facilities in the
rights-of-way.
(1) Generally. All wireless telecommunications facilities in the rightsof-
way shall: first, be located in accordance with the location
priorities in Subsection I below; and second, be the most
aesthetically pleasing alternative for the type of location. In
addition, such facilities must meet the minimum requirements set
forth in this chapter, the wireless regulations, and the
requirements of any other applicable law. An applicant must
establish that it is installing stealth facilities to the extent possible
and must:
(a) Show that it is installing facilities in the highest priority
locations that are available and necessary to the provision of
service or to avoid a prohibition. As part of its application, an
applicant must describe in detail its efforts to place a wireless
telecommunications facility at each higher priority location,
including what properties were contacted, and the reasons
why applicant claims the wireless telecommunications facility
cannot be placed at a higher priority location.
(b) Submit RF engineering data signed by an engineer for the
relevant wireless provider, including propagation maps and
supporting information identifying areas where a wireless
telecommunications facility could be placed that would serve
the areas where applicant believes that service is required, and
describing the wireless telecommunications facility required to
provide such services;
(c) Submit a written explanation as to why it claims its proposed
wireless telecommunications facility is the least intrusive
alternative, considered individually, and as part of any project
of which it is a part that involves installation of more than one
wireless telecommunications facility; and taking into account
all potential alternatives, whether or not raised by the City or
its citizens, including all those that a diligent applicant acting
in good faith would raise.
§ 196-5 TREES § 196-5
187:869
(2) Waiver of requirements. Subject to § 196-5G(4), the wireless
regulations and decisions on applications for placement of wireless
telecommunications facilities in the rights-of-way shall, at a
minimum, ensure that the requirements of this chapter are
satisfied, unless, in the case only of an applicant who has the
requisite status protected by federal laws, it is determined that
applicant has established that denial of an application would,
within the meaning of federal law, prohibit or effectively prohibit
the provision of personal wireless services, or otherwise violate
applicable laws or regulations, under circumstances such that
deployment of the facilities must be authorized. If that
determination is made, the requirements of this chapter, including
any regulations and forms to implement this chapter, may be
waived, but only to the minimum extent required to avoid conflict
with federal law.
(3) Standards. Wireless telecommunications facilities in the rights-ofway
shall be installed and modified in a manner that minimizes
risks to public safety, avoids placement of aboveground facilities in
underground areas, avoids installation of new support structures or
equipment cabinets in the public rights-of-way, complies in the
rights-of-way with the City's prioritization list in Subsection I(2)
below and otherwise maintains the integrity and character of the
neighborhoods and corridors in which the facilities are located;
ensures that installations are subject to periodic review to
minimize the intrusion on the rights-of-way and compliance with
health and safety codes; and ensures that the City bears no risk or
liability as a result of the installations, and that such use does not
inconvenience the public, interfere with the primary uses of the
rights-of-way, or hinder the ability of the City or other government
agencies to improve, modify, relocate, abandon or vacate the
rights-of-way or any portion thereof, or the ability of the City or
other government agencies to cause the improvement,
modification, relocation, vacation or abandonment of facilities in
the rights-of-way.
(4) Concealment. The special use permits for wireless
telecommunications facilities in the rights-of-way shall incorporate
specific concealment elements to minimize visual impacts
consistent with the wireless regulations, and shall incorporate
design requirements ensuring compliance with all standards for
noise emissions and in accordance with Chapter 133 of the Rye City
Code. In general, all equipment shall be the smallest and least
visibly and sonically intrusive equipment feasible. Unless it is
determined that another design is less intrusive or placement is
required under applicable law:
(a) Antennas located at the top of support structures shall be
incorporated into the structure, or placed within shrouds of a
§ 196-5 RYE CODE § 196-5
187:870
size such that the antenna appears to be part of the support
structure;
(b) Antennas placed elsewhere on a support structure shall be
integrated into the structure, or be designed and placed to
minimize visual impacts.
(c) Radio units or equipment cabinets holding radio units and
mounted on a utility pole shall be placed as high as possible on
the utility pole, placed to avoid interfering or creating any
hazard to any other use of the public rights-of-way, and located
on one side of the utility pole. Unless the radio units or
equipment cabinets can be concealed by appropriate traffic
signage, radio units or equipment cabinets mounted below the
communications space on utility poles shall be designed so that
visibility is limited to the fewest number of people, the largest
dimension is vertical, and the width is such that the radio units
or equipment cabinets are minimally visible from the opposite
side of the support structure on which they are placed. In
underground areas, the equipment cabinets shall be located
underground with any above ground intrusion minimized. If an
equipment cabinet must be located aboveground, then the
cabinet shall be a stealth facility and shall substantially
incorporate all other concealment elements. If an equipment
box must be placed on a pole, the box shall be placed on the
pole in such a fashion as to have it front facing the closing
boundary of the right-of-way.
(d) Wiring and cabling shall be neat and concealed within, or
within conduit, flush to the support structure, ensuring
concealment of these components to the greatest extent
possible.
(e) Ground-mounted or pole-mounted (other than antennas)
equipment associated with a wireless telecommunications
facility is prohibited in underground areas and shall be
permitted only where consistent with the portion of the
corridor in which it is to be placed, and may be required to be
undergrounded, located in alleys or otherwise shielded.
Ground-mounted equipment shall not interfere with pedestrian
or vehicular traffic.
(f) Wireless telecommunications facilities shall comply with FCC
regulations governing radio frequency ("RF") emissions. At all
times, every wireless telecommunications facility shall comply
with applicable FCC regulations governing RF emissions, and
failure to comply shall be treated as a material violation of the
terms of any permit or lease. No special use permit shall be
issued or effective unless it is shown that the wireless
telecommunications facility will comply with those regulations;
any areas where occupational or general public exposures will
§ 196-5 TREES § 196-5
187:871
exceed FCC limits are identified, and there is a clear plan
addressing safety for any areas where exposures may exceed
those limits.
(g) No towers greater than 80 feet shall be permitted in the public
rights-of-way, and no wireless telecommunications facilities
shall be permitted aboveground in underground areas; towers
less than or equal to 80 feet may be placed in the public rightsof-
way only on major roads in the Membership Club zoning
district or on golf courses provided that the City Council
determines that such towers in the public right-of-way or on
the golf course would be the most aesthetically pleasing means
to serve an area with low residential density. Any tower design
must be as consistent as possible with the corridor in which the
facility is placed, and minimize the obtrusiveness of the facility
considered individually and as part of a network of wireless
telecommunications facilities. For towers proposed to be
located in the right-of-way, all other restrictions including, but
not limited to equipment type and placement, setback
requirements, safety concerns and aesthetics shall still apply.
(5) No electric meters shall be placed on a utility pole or any other
supporting structure.
(6) Underground installations will have no protrusions above preexisting
grade.
(7) Any graffiti on any wireless telecommunications facility support
structure or any accessory equipment shall be removed within 30
days upon notification of the owner.
I. Demonstration of compliance with wireless regulations. As part of
showing that the proposed location and structure meets the criteria in
this law and the wireless regulations, an applicant is required to show
how it has complied with the priority lists below unless the applicant
can show that compliance is prohibitory:
(1) The highest priority locations for all installations are:

187:872
(2) The priority of locations for installations in the residential right-ofway
are (assuming, first, compliance with Subsection I(1) above), in
order of priority:
(a) Located on a major road, at least 60 feet or more from the
nearest residential unit;
(b) Located on other roads but only when required to be
nonprohibitory, and at least 60 feet or more from the nearest
residential unit;
(c) Located on a major road, at least 40 feet from the nearest
residential unit;
(3) Municipal property in Subsection I(1) and (2) above shall be a
higher priority than other locations in the same category.
(4) Installations in the residential right-of-way shall be micro-wireless
facilities only unless this requirement would be prohibitory.
(5) An applicant is further required to show that its proposed
installation or modification:
(a) Minimizes the visual impact of the wireless
telecommunications facilities and associated supporting
structures upon the community, and in particular upon
residential units, as proposed and under any modification that
could be made to that installation as of right; and
(b) Is designed to be consistent with the overall characteristics of
the area where the facilities are located; and
(c) Has minimized the new supporting structures proposed, and
the impact of those supporting structures.
(d) In considering the visibility of wireless telecommunications
facilities, City may consider separately and in conjunction with
any nearby or similar facilities, or any other facilities then
proposed, the mass and size of the facilities, the scale of the
facilities (or the effect of the placement on the mass, size and
scale of supporting structures to which or within which the
wireless telecommunications facilities may be attached or
concealed), and any other factor that may affect the impact on
the community. It may consider the elements of a wireless
telecommunications facility separately and collectively, and
may require a showing the visibility of each element of the
wireless telecommunications facility, and the effect on any
supporting structure to which the wireless telecommunications
facility will be attached, has been minimized.
(e) It has proposed facilities using universal antennae, each
having and utilizing multicarrier capacity to the fullest extent
technologically possible.
§ 196-5 TREES § 196-5
187:873
§ 196-6. Special use permit, special exception permit, and eligible
facility permit application requirements.
(6) The City may approve or require placement in a location that is not
the highest priority where the record shows a proposed installation
at a different location will result in less impact on the community,
considering the specific installation that is proposed and any
project of which it is a part that involves installation of more than
one wireless telecommunications facility.
(7) In considering whether a proposal meets the general requirements
of this law and the wireless regulations, the City will consider the
impact of a planned project as a whole, taking into account the
factors specified above.
A. All applicants for a special use permit or a special exception permit (in
the case of a special exception permit only to the extent set forth in
Subsection U and in the case of an eligible facility permit only to the
extent set forth in Subsection V for a wireless telecommunications
facility or any modification of such facility shall comply with the
requirements set forth in this section. In addition to the information
required by § 196-5E, an applicant for a special use permit must comply
with the requirements of this section, as applicable.
B. An application shall be signed on behalf of the applicant by the person
preparing the same and with knowledge of the contents and
representations made therein and attesting to the truth and
completeness of the information. The landowner, if different than the
applicant, shall also sign the application. At the discretion of the
Council, any false or misleading statement in the application may
subject the applicant to denial of the application without further
consideration or opportunity for correction, or to revocation of the
permit if the permit is issued. No application shall be accepted and no
special use permit, special exception permit or eligible facility permit
application shall be issued for a property where the building inspector
has found, or there exists, a violation of the City Code and where such
violation has not been corrected.
C. Applications not meeting the requirements stated herein or which are
otherwise incomplete may be rejected by the Council. Upon notice of
incompleteness by the City, the applicable shot clock will reset to zero
and the City shall have the original applicable time period permitted by
law to act on the completed application. The shot clock shall remain
tolled until the applicant submits the required supplemental
information. If the application for a wireless telecommunications permit
is incomplete, all other permits requested by the same applicant that
must be acted upon by the same date as that application will also be
deemed incomplete or denied. If any other permit that must be acted
upon by the same date as the wireless telecommunications application
is incomplete, both it and the wireless telecommunications application
shall be declared incomplete or denied.

safety, general welfare or environment, including the visual and scenic
characteristics of the area. Where possible, for wireless
telecommunications facilities located outside of the rights-of-way
wiring and other components shall be located within buildings. Wireless
telecommunications facilities installed on the exterior of existing
buildings/supporting structures shall be integrated into the design of
such buildings/supporting structures. The intent of this provision is to
make the installation invisible or indistinguishable from other existing
architectural features. Both the wireless telecommunications facility
and all accessory or associated facilities shall maximize the use of
building materials, colors and textures designed to blend with the
§ 196-6 RYE CODE § 196-6
187:878
existing supporting structure to which it may be affixed and with the
natural surroundings. Where possible, for facilities in the rights-ofway,
when existing utility poles are replaced, the wireless
telecommunications facility will be placed within a pole approved by the
City and the utility.
M. An access road and parking to assure adequate emergency and service
access shall be provided, should such be deemed necessary by the
Council. Maximum use of existing roads, whether public or private,
shall be made to the extent practicable. Road construction shall at all

technical, safety and safety-related codes adopted by the City, county,
state or United States, including but not limited to the most recent
editions of the National Electrical Safety Code and the National
Electrical Code, as well as accepted and responsibly workmanlike
industry practices and recommended practices of the National
Association of Tower Erectors. The codes referred to are codes that
include, but are not limited to, construction, building, electrical, fire,
safety, health and land use codes. The applicant is responsible for
ensuring compliance with the foregoing for the wireless
telecommunications facility and any portion of an existing supporting
structure affected by the wireless telecommunications facility. In the
event of a conflict between or among any of the preceding, the more
stringent shall apply.
O. Every person constructing or owning a wireless telecommunications
facility shall obtain, at its own expense, all permits and licenses
required by applicable law, rule, regulation or law and must maintain
the same, in full force and effect, for as long as required by the City or
other governmental entity or agency having jurisdiction over the
applicant.
P. The Council intends to be the lead agency, pursuant to SEQRA. The
Council shall conduct a review of the proposed project in combination
with its review of the application under this chapter.
Q. An applicant shall submit to the City Engineer the number of completed
applications determined to be needed at the preapplication meeting. A
copy of the notification of application shall be provided to the legislative
body of all adjacent municipalities and to the Westchester County
Planning Board.
R. If the applicant is proposing the construction of a tower or installation
on an existing tower or building, the applicant shall examine the
§ 196-6 TREES § 196-6
187:879
feasibility of designing a multicarrier use to extent practicable and
consistent with other requirements of this chapter. This requirement
may be waived, provided that the applicant, in writing, demonstrates
that the provisions of future shared usage of the wireless
telecommunications facility is not technologically feasible, or is
commercially impracticable and creates an unnecessary and
unreasonable burden, based upon:
(1) The number of FCC licenses foreseeably available for the area.
(2) The kind of wireless telecommunications facility proposed, or
existing supporting structure that would be utilized.
(3) Available space on existing and approved towers.
S. Unless waived by the Council, there shall be a preapplication meeting
required for every special use permit. The purpose of the preapplication
meeting will be to address issues which will help to expedite the review
and permitting process. Where the application is for the shared use of
an existing tower or supporting structure, the applicant can seek to
waive any application requirements that may not be applicable. At the
preapplication meeting, the waiver requests, if appropriate, will be
decided by the City. Costs of the City's consultants to prepare for and
attend the preapplication meeting will be borne by the applicant.
T. Without limiting the foregoing, except where it is demonstrated that
denial would result in a prohibition of the provision of wireless services
within the meaning of federal law:
(1) In the rights-of-way, no Towers are permitted except as permitted
in § 196-5H(4)(g).
(2) No wireless telecommunications facilities are permitted within
underground areas except those that are located underground.
(3) A new or replacement supporting structure, other than a stealth
facility or one permitted in § 196-5H(4)(g), street lighting or traffic
control structure may not be approved that is greater in height
from ground level than the average height of existing distribution
utility poles in the same area. No extension of an existing
supporting structure (other than street lighting or traffic control
structures) to permit installation of a wireless telecommunications
facility may be approved that unless the addition complies with
Subsection T(5) and increases the height of the supporting
structure by no more than the lesser of 20% or six feet.
(4) Except for cabling within a conduit, the lowest edge of any
component of the wireless telecommunications facility on a utility
pole must be at least 12 feet above the ground unless concealed
within the pole.
§ 196-6 RYE CODE § 196-6
187:880
(5) All wireless telecommunications facilities mounted to the side of a
supporting structure in the right-of-way, other than in the
communications space, must be flush-mounted, sized and painted
so that the facility to the extent possible the facility is concealed;
(6) All wireless telecommunications facilities mounted to the top of a
utility pole must be designed so that the facilities form a continuous
and uninterrupted line with the pole, and as a concealment

B. If, after such review, the Council determines that the permitted wireless
telecommunications facility is in compliance with the special use
permit, special exception permit, or eligible facility permit and all
applicable codes, laws and rules; that it continues to be used in the
provision of wireless services; that all relevant entities continue to have
all necessary authorizations; and that the facility cannot be modified or
replaced so that it is less visible or less audible, or has a lesser adverse
impact on aesthetics, community character or property values, then the
Council shall issue a recertification special use permit, special
exception permit, or eligible facility permit for the wireless
telecommunications facility, which may include any new provisions or
conditions that may be lawfully imposed, or that are required by codes,
law or regulation.

submit a request for recertification of such permit within the time
frame noted in Subsection A of this section, or if the Council finds that
the wireless telecommunications facility has been moved, relocated,
rebuilt, or otherwise modified without approval of such having been
granted by the Council under this chapter, or that the conditions for
recertification have not been met, then such special use permit, special
exception permit, or eligible facility permit and any authorizations
granted thereunder shall cease to exist on the date of the fifth
anniversary of the original granting of the special use permit, special
exception permit, or eligible facility permit or subsequent fifth
anniversaries, unless the holder of the special use permit, special
exception permit, or eligible facility permit adequately demonstrates to
the Council that extenuating circumstances prevented a timely
recertification request. If the Council agrees that there were
legitimately extenuating circumstances, then the holder of the permit
may submit a late recertification request. Council may also recertify
subject to additional conditions that it establishes, and contingent on
satisfaction of those conditions.

wireless telecommunications facility, the City may require removal of
those elements, in addition to taking any action against the owner of the
supporting structure or tower.
A. Under the following circumstances, the Council may determine that the
health, safety and welfare interests of the City warrant and require the
removal of a wireless telecommunications facility:
(1) A wireless telecommunications facility with a permit has been
abandoned (i.e., not used as a wireless telecommunications facility)
for a period exceeding 90 days or a total of 180 days in any 365-day
period, except for periods caused by force majeure or acts of God.
(2) A permitted wireless telecommunications facility falls into such a
state of disrepair that it creates a health or safety hazard.
(3) A wireless telecommunications facility has been located,
constructed or modified without first obtaining the required special
use permit, or any other necessary authorization.
§ 196-26 TREES § 196-27

use permit or special exception permit to lapse or has otherwise
failed to timely comply with providing the City with the required
inspection reports, NIER certifications or other information in
order to confirm such facility's compliance with this chapter.
B. If the Council makes such a determination as noted in Subsection A of
this section, then the Council shall notify the holder of the special use
permit or special exception permit for the wireless telecommunications
facility within 48 hours that said wireless telecommunications facility is
to be removed. The Council may approve an interim temporary use
agreement/permit, such as to enable the sale of the wireless
telecommunications facility.
C. The holder of the special use permit or special exception permit, or its
successors or assigns, shall dismantle and remove such wireless
telecommunications facility, and all associated supporting structures or
portions of supporting structures and accessory facilities and
structures used solely by it, from the site and restore the site to as close
to its original condition as is possible, such restoration being limited
only by physical or commercial impracticability, within 90 days of
receipt of written notice from the Council. However, if the owner of the
property upon which the wireless telecommunications facility is located
wishes to retain any access roadway to the wireless
telecommunications facility, the owner may do so with the approval of
the Council.
D. If removal, or substantial progress to complete removal has not
occurred within 90 days after the permit holder has received notice,
then the Council may order officials or representatives of the City to
remove the wireless telecommunications facility and associated
structures at the sole expense of the owner or permit holder.
E. If the owner of property that is removed does not claim the property
and remove the property from the site to a lawful location within 10
days, then the City may take steps to declare the property abandoned
and sell it and its components.
F. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the Council
may approve a temporary use agreement/permit for the wireless
telecommunications facility, for no more 90 days, during which time a
suitable plan for removal, conversion or relocation of the affected
wireless telecommunications facility shall be developed by the holder of
the permit, subject to the approval of the Council, and an agreement to
such plan shall be executed by the holder of the permit and the City. If
such a plan is not developed, approved and executed within the ninetyday
time period, then the City may take possession of and dispose of the
affected wireless telecommunications facility in the manner provided in
this section.

General Regulations
§ 197-4. Compliance required.
No building, structure or premises shall hereafter be used and no building
or part thereof or other structure shall be erected, moved, reconstructed,
enlarged or altered except in conformity with regulations herein specified
for the district in which it is located. No existing yard, lot area, dimension
or other requirement shall be diminished below the requirements of this
chapter.
§ 197-5. Continuing or replacing existing uses or structures.
A. Regulation of nonconforming uses or structures.
(1) Any building, structure or use existing on the effective date of this
section which does not conform to the provisions of this chapter for
the district in which it is located may be continued subject to the
requirements of this Article.
(2) An existing nonconforming use may be replaced by another
nonconforming use, provided no structural alterations are made,
and provided the substituted use is not prohibited in the most
restricted district in which such existing nonconforming use is
allowed and is approved as not more objectionable by the Board of
Appeals, subject to appropriate conditions.
(3) If a nonconforming use of buildings or land shall have been
changed to a more restricted use, it may not be changed to a less
restricted use.
(4) If a nonconforming use shall cease for a period of six months or
longer, it shall not be resumed.
(5) No nonconformity as to use shall be increased or enlarged, except
under the provisions of § 197-82. [Amended 2-5-1992 by L.L. No.
1-1992]
(6) No structure used for a nonconforming use shall be reestablished,
restored or used if the structure is destroyed, damaged or removed
by any cause if the cost of such re-establishment or restoration
would, according to the estimate of the Building Inspector, exceed
50% of the assessed value of the structure at the time of the
destruction, damage or removal; but if such cost would be less than
50% of such value, it may be restored or used, provided that it is
done within 12 months of such time. In a specific case involving
unnecessary hardship, the Board of Appeals may permit such reestablishment,
restoration or use even though such cost would
exceed 50% of such assessed value, provided that it would not
exceed 50% of the reproduction value of the damaged structure at
such time of damage, except as provided for in § 197-5A(10) and
§ 197-4 TREES § 197-5
187:907
(12). In cases involving water-dependent uses and related
structures, the Board of Appeals may permit such re-establishment,
restoration or use even though such cost would exceed 50% of
the assessed value or reproduction value, provided that the
reestablished or restored use and structures will result in no
greater intensity of activity and development than the use and
structures at the time they were destroyed or damaged, the cost
of the re-establishment or restoration will not exceed 100% of
the reproduction value of the damaged structures at such time
of damage and the work will be done within 12 months after
approvals are obtained from all other government agencies.

A. A site development plan for the entire lot shall be approved by the
Planning Commission in the same manner as prescribed by the City of
Rye for the approval of a subdivision, except as provided for in
Subsection C of this section, in conjunction with the following:
(1) The construction or establishment of the following structures or
uses, or their enlargement, extension or change in such a manner
as to increase the ratio of floor area to lot area by 10% or more
above that existing on January 1, 1964, or in such a manner as to
affect required additional off-street parking or access from streets
to the premises, or design of interiors, entrances, exits or hallways
of buildings to accommodate additional occupancies or changes of
occupancy:
(a) A residential use involving the housing of three or more
families on one lot or a residential care facility.
(b) A nonresidential use or structure or a group of uses or
structures aggregating more than 1,000 square feet of gross
floor or land area.
(c) A nonresidential use of vacant land as a main use on a lot.
(d) Any use of a lot containing land created by the filling of a

The construction or remodeling of a structure or group of structures
housing three or more families on one lot shall be subject to the following
requirements:
as is provided for in Subsection A(2)99 of this section and
Section 8-4.1 of the General Ordinances of the City.
B. The Planning Commission may require as a condition of approval such
modifications of a site plan and/or permit as it deems necessary to
ensure compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of this chapter.
Such conditions may include those authorized by §§ 117-9 and 170-18 of
this Code. No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued
for development or use of such property except in conformity with the
approved site development plan. In addition, the Commission may
authorize such development to be undertaken in stages, provided that
each stage and any combination of stages would, upon completion,
constitute an appropriate development of the site.
C. In the case of a lot with a legally existing building for which a site
development plan was not required at the time it was constructed or
last modified, the owner or applicant need not apply for preliminary site
development plan approval and may apply directly for final site
development plan approval. Upon receipt of a complete application for
final site plan approval, submitted as provided for in this subsection,
the City Planner may schedule the application for a public hearing at
the next regular meeting of the Planning Commission.
A. No building shall contain more than six dwelling units on each floor, nor

units in the building. [Amended 2-7-1990 by Ord. No. 2-1990]
C. There shall be garage or parking space as required by § 197-28. In
order that some of these spaces may be convenient for use by visitors as
well as occupants, 1/2 of the required car spaces shall be directly
accessible and within 100 feet by the normal approach from the street
to the main entrance of the residential building they serve. At least 2/3
of the required car spaces shall be outdoor spaces. However, the
Planning Commission, when acting on a particular site plan, may
approve covered or garage parking up to 2/3 of the required car spaces
if it finds that the design and location of such spaces is such that it is

D. The Planning Commission may modify the requirements of Subsections
A and C of this section where in its judgment it deems such
modifications desirable and appropriate because of the characteristics
of the specific site, such as topography, size, shape and location thereof.
[Added 5-7-1969 by Ord. No. 1-1969]
E. If the Planning Commission finds that a general surface water problem
in the vicinity of a site can be improved by incorporating the surface
water runoff from the proposed site improvements and the surface
water runoff in the vicinity of the site into a single stormwater retention
facility, it may reduce the required front, side and rear yards specified
in the Table of Regulations for RA Apartment Districts, but to no less
than the requirements for the next-less-restrictive RA Apartment
District, to properly locate the buildings, parking and the stormwater
retention facility. [Added 2-20-1980 by L.L. No. 2-1980]

death;
(e) One adult 18 years of age or older residing with a person who
is 55 years of age or older, provided that said adult is essential
to the long-term care of the elderly person as certified by a
physician duly licensed in New York State
(2) Persons under the age of 55 not specifically permitted to be
occupants shall not be permitted to be permanent residents of
dwelling units. For the purposes of this section, a "permanent
resident" shall mean any person who resides within the dwelling
for more than three consecutive weeks or in excess of 30 days in
§ 197-8 TREES § 197-8.1
187:913
any calendar year, or has listed the residence as an abode for
any purpose whatsoever, including, but not limited to, enrollment
in public or private schools. Temporary occupancy by guests of
families shall be permitted, provided that such occupancy does not
exceed a total of 30 days in any calendar year.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, one dwelling unit within the
community may be set aside to be occupied by a superintendent or
building manager, to which the limitations on occupancy set forth
above shall not apply.
(4) The limitations on occupancy shall be included in the marketing
materials for the development as well as within the rules and
regulations or terms of any leases, bylaws or covenants and
restrictions for the development. Violations of the limitations on
occupancy shall be enforceable by the City of Rye Building
Inspector against the owner or lessee or the agent of any of them
and shall be punishable by a fine of $250 per day or by
imprisonment not exceeding 15 days, or by both such fine and
imprisonment. Exceptions to these regulations shall be granted if
any limitations are determined to be in violation of any state or
federal law.
(5) The Planning Commission shall have the right to require that the
owner execute agreements and covenants as it may deem to be
required during any site plan approval process as it may reasonably
deem to be required to ensure compliance with the stated intent of
this section. Said agreements or covenants shall be recorded in the
office of the Westchester County Clerk and constitute a covenant
running with the land. Such covenant or agreement may be
modified or released only as set forth in said covenant or
agreement or by the City Council.
B. Site development
(1) At least 80% of the required parking for the development shall be
provided in a covered parking structure within the basement level
of the principal structure(s).

front lot line of the lot shall be Boston Post Road or Old Post Road
for purposes of the applicable front yard setback, irrespective of
building arrangement. The provisions of § 197-52 shall not apply to
properties in the RA-6 Zone.
(3) The provisions of § 197-8A and C shall not apply to properties in the

C. Capital improvement contribution.
(1) The City Council has found that projects of the size and scope as
reasonably anticipated to be developed within this zoning district
will result in additional demands upon City infrastructure and
community facilities. The City Council has found that, to effect an
equitable balancing of the costs associated with the infrastructure
and facility needs, there should be a fair assessment of a financial
"capital improvement contribution" from new development under
this zoning district.
(2) The capital improvement contribution for any new development
proposed within this zoning district shall be $10,000 per new
dwelling unit.
(3) The capital improvement contribution shall be a one-time fee paid
by the property owner and/or developer at the time a building
permit is issued and shall be calculated based on the amount of
new dwelling units approved in such application.
(4) The provisions of this section shall apply to any new development
or additions to any existing development within this zoning district.
(5) Any capital improvement contributions collected under this section
shall be used by the City solely for the purpose of capital
improvements to offset the additional demands and impacts
relating to approved Active Senior Residence applications.
A. Residence districts. Permitted accessory uses, except wireless
telecommunications facilities as set forth in Subsection A(5) of this
subsection, shall be limited to uses not only customarily incidental to,
but in fact accessory to and a minor part of, a permitted main use, and
subject to the following specific provisions:
(1) No private way or walk giving access to a use not permitted in the
district shall be permitted as an accessory use in any district.
(2) No portions of a detached garage or other accessory structure shall
be provided with cooking facilities or otherwise equipped as a
housekeeping unit except for occupancy by domestic employees of
the owners or tenants of the main building. Any such accessory
building so used shall have the same front, side and rear yards as
are required of a principal residential building in that district.
(3) Garage space or current parking space may be provided for two
motor vehicles on any lot. In an R-1 to RT District inclusive, space
for one additional motor vehicle may be provided for each 3,000
square feet by which the area of the lot exceeds 5,000 square feet;
§ 197-8.1 TREES § 197-9
187:915
but a garage for more than five vehicles shall be at least 50 feet
from every lot line. Not more than one commercial vehicle and not
exceeding one-half-ton weight or capacity may be currently parked
or garaged on any lot, except that farms or truck gardens are
not subject to this limitation. Space for one noncommercial vehicle
may be rented to persons not resident on the same lot. The above
provisions apply also to private stables, one horse being considered
as the equivalent of two motor vehicles. In an RA-1, RA-2, RA-3 or
RA-4 District, there may be accessory garage space not over one
story high for one car for each dwelling unit on the lot, but no such
building shall be within 10 feet of any lot line.
(4) A satellite earth station dish antenna that is an incidental and
accessory use to the permitted main residence and is for the
exclusive use of the occupants of the residence and their guests
may be permitted by the Board of Architectural Review, subject to
the following conditions:
(a) It shall be located in the rear yard.
(b) It shall be ground-mounted.
(c) It shall be set back from side and rear property lines at least 20
feet in R-1 Districts and 15 feet in all other districts.
(d) The overall height, measured from the average natural grade
to the highest part of the dish antenna, and width and depth of
the dish antenna shall each not exceed 15 feet.
(e) It shall be screened, including accessory equipment, from the
view of the street and abutting residentially zoned properties
by a ten-foot-wide landscaping strip planted and maintained
with at least a double row of alternately spaced evergreens,
with an actual height of at least six feet above the natural
grade when installed. The Board of Architectural Review may,
in appropriate cases, approve alternative landscaping for the
same reasons as set forth for alternate landscaping for pools
and courts in § 53-5D(1) through (6) of this Code. In addition,
the Board of Architectural Review may, upon a showing by the
applicant that the required landscaping screen will
significantly diminish the reception capacity of the dish
antenna, modify or vary the landscaping requirements, but
only to the extent that the modification or variation will not be
inconsistent with the spirit and intent of this section or be less
protective of the view from abutting properties.
(5) Wireless telecommunications facilities are subject to the
requirements of Chapter 196, Wireless Telecommunications
Facilities, of this Code.
B. Business and Coastal Zone districts.

C. Public buildings and property in all districts. (Reserved)
A. The uses indicated in Column 2 of the Table of Regulations made a part
hereof, entitled "Uses Permitted Subject to Additional Standards and
Requirements," are permitted as follows: Upon receipt of an application
for any such use by the Building Inspector, he shall refer such
application to the Planning Commission of the City at its next regular
meeting. The Planning Commission, after public notice and hearing,
shall within 90 days thereafter file with the Building Inspector a report
on such application so referred to it. The Planning Commission shall, in
each such case, give consideration and effect to the objectives set forth
in Subdivisions 24 and 25 of § 20 of the General City Law, and it shall
give consideration to and make findings as to whether the following
conditions prevail:
(1) In a residence district the proposed use will serve a community
need or convenience.
(2) The proposed use will be appropriate in the proposed location and
will have no material adverse effect on existing or prospective
conforming development, and the proposed site is adequate in size
for the use.
(3) In cases where conversion is proposed of a structure designed and
built originally for other uses, the structure will be adaptable.
(4) The proposed use will be provided with adequate off-street parking
to meet its needs, properly screened from adjoining residential
uses, and entrance and exit drives are to be laid out to minimize
traffic hazards and nuisance.
(5) The potential generation of traffic will be within the reasonable
capacity of the existing or planned streets and highways providing
access to the site.
(6) There are available adequate and proper public or private facilities
for the treatment, removal or discharge of sewage, refuse or other
effluent that may be caused or created by or as a result of the use.
(7) In a Coastal Zone District, a conventional subdivision or a
subdivision lot grouped pursuant to § 197-39 will accomplish the
following: [Added 6-19-1991 by L.L. No. 13-1991]
§ 197-9 TREES § 197-10
187:917
(a) All wetlands and floodplains shall be preserved.
(b) All buildings and facilities shall be so arranged as to preserve
to the maximum extent practical, the view of the shoreline
from public streets.
(c) Where any development borders the waterfront there shall be
a one-hundred-foot-wide strip of land along the waterfront
which shall not include any area of the site below mean sea
level or beyond the upland property line, whichever is most
protective of proper drainage, flood protection and edge effect
along the waterfront.
B. The Commission, in its report, shall also recommend in appropriate
instances whether the maximum size of the establishment in the
number of employees, square feet of floor space, number and size of
dwelling units or other appropriate measure should be limited, and also
the extent of any such limitation required in order to limit the potential
generation of traffic, to limit the impact upon the community of other
consequences of the establishment of such a use and to minimize
potentially adverse effects. [Amended 5-7-1969 by Ord. No. 1-1969]
C. Upon receipt by the Building Inspector of such report of the Planning
Commission showing that said conditions in Subsection A(1) to (6)
inclusive prevail, as well as its recommendations as to appropriate
conditions and safeguards, and upon compliance by the applicant with
the applicable standards and requirements set forth in said Table of
Regulations and in §§ 197-11, 197-12 and 197-84 hereof and the
provisions of the Building Code of the City100 and the provisions of any
other applicable laws and ordinances, the applicant shall, upon the
payment of any fee prescribed therefor, be entitled to a building permit
or certificate of compliance, as the case may be, from the Building
Inspector, subject to the recommended conditions and safeguards. In
the event that the Planning Commission shall not make a finding that
any of the above-enumerated conditions in Subsection A(1) to (6)
inclusive prevail, the Building Inspector shall refuse to issue a building
permit or certificate of compliance, as the case requires.
D. If the Building Inspector, after considering the report and
recommendations of the Planning Commission, issues the permit
applied for or if he refuses to issue such permit, then in either of such
cases any person aggrieved by such determination and action of the
Building Inspector in issuing or refusing to issue such permit may take
an appeal from the Building Inspector's decision and action to the
Board of Appeals as provided in § 197-81 within such period of time as
is prescribed by such Board by general rule and as provided in § 81 of
the General City Law. Said Board is hereby authorized and empowered
in such cases to hear and fully decide and dispose of such matter with
the same force and effect as if this chapter required it in the first
100. Editor's Note: See Ch. 68, Building Construction.

§ 197-13.1. Residential Floodplain and Wetland Preservation
District. [Added 11-18-1981 by L.L. No. 9-1981]
The City of Rye finds that it is in the interest of the public health, safety
and welfare to create a new zoning district zoning category which will
encourage the owners of lots with areas of 10 acres or more located in
R-1 and R-2 Single-Family Residential Zoning Districts, at least 25% of the
acreage of which is a wetland and/or in an area of special flood hazard, to
develop these lots for residential use without locating buildings in the area
of special flood hazard nor in any other way increase flooding elsewhere
in the City of Rye. To implement this policy, the Residential Floodplain and
A. In addition to the findings required by § 197-10, the Planning
Commission shall give consideration to and make findings as to whether
the following conditions prevail:
(1) The topography and natural features of the site make it particularly
suitable for such development.
(2) The design of the development, including buildings and
landscaping, is such as to be in harmony with the prevailing
character of the neighborhood.
B. The maximum height of apartment houses shall not exceed 45 feet or
four stories. The average height of all apartment houses in a
development shall not exceed 30 feet, such average being calculated as
weighted average based on the number of square feet of ground floor
area of buildings for each of such different heights as are being
averaged.
C. No building higher than 30 feet shall be located closer to any lot line
than a distance equal to 1 1/2 times its height. No two buildings shall be
located closer to each other than a distance equal to the average of
their heights.

(1) The Council creates this incentive-based special use permit in
order to maintain the historic elements of convenience retail
storefront design and uses which contribute to the character of the
City's Central Business District. As such, the Council adopts a
policy to incentivize the preservation of the character of the
Central Business District by allowing in the B-2 Central Business
District banks to be located on the first floor of a building on the
condition that the historic nature of the building, or its contributing
elements, are preserved and maintained. The purpose of this
section is to achieve the following goals:
(a) Promoting the preservation of buildings that have enhanced
and defined the historic nature of Rye over the past decades.
(b) Preserving the existing small convenience and retail stores in
the B-2 Central Business District and furthering the
community needs to preserve a diverse economic base.
(c) Balancing the desire for historic preservation of certain
buildings and uses with the need to allow for financially viable
uses of buildings.
(d) Furthering the City's goal to provide incentive zoning
techniques for development projects that meet a defined
community need and desire such as historic preservation and
maintaining community character.
B. Procedures for special use permits; permit applications.
(1) Applications for a permit shall be made to the City Planner on forms
furnished by the City Planner's office.
(2) An application for a permit shall not be deemed complete if it does
not include all of the following information:
(a) The application fee of $150.
(b) Complete plans for the building(s), or portions thereof, which
the applicant believes furthers the intent of this section and for
the bank or other uses of the building(s) on the property.

§ 197-26.1. Calculation of parking requirements in A and B Parking
Districts. [Added 10-16-1985 by L.L. No. 12-1985]
On-site parking requirements for new uses or buildings, building
expansions or changes in use shall be calculated by first determining the
A. Buildings, structures and land uses in existence at the time this section
became effective or buildings, structures and uses for which building
permits or site plans have been approved at the time this section or
pertinent amendments thereto become effective shall not be subject to
the requirements set forth in § 197-28, provided that any parking
facilities now existing to serve such buildings, structures or uses shall
not in the future be reduced except where they exceed such
requirements, in which case they may not be reduced below such
requirements. Required parking facilities for such buildings, structures
or uses as well as for any enlargement, extension or change in use
which increases off-street parking requirements as set forth in § 197-28
shall, however, be provided as a condition for the issuance of any
building permit or the approval of any site plan for such enlargement,
extension or change in use in the future.
B. In case of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship to such
properties arising out of this requirement, appeal may be made to the
Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with § 197-81, which shall
require only such degree of compliance as may be deemed reasonable
for that part of the building, structure or use that is legally
nonconforming but may not waiver any part of the requirements for
that part of the building, structure or use that constitutes an
enlargement or extension and may not permit reduction or elimination
of whatever quantity of parking may already be in existence unless it is
in excess of such requirements. Required off-street parking facilities
which after development are later dedicated to and accepted by the
City shall be deemed to continue to serve the buildings, structures and
uses to meet the requirements for which they were originally provided.
In the event that a prior agreement was entered into to make payments
or payment has been made in full in lieu of providing required on-site
parking in the A or B Parking District, the number of on-site parking
spaces represented by said agreement or payment in full shall be
counted as existing on-site parking, provided that the property owner is
not in default of making said payments.

existing use credit by dividing the area of the lot, in square feet, by 832
square feet and adding thereto parking spaces, if any, already provided on
site and which are to remain. The parking requirements for the proposed
use of the site shall be determined based on the requirements set forth in
§ 197-28 of this chapter. In the event that the credit is larger than the new
requirement, the excess shall be noted on the approved site development
plan as a credit for future site plan modifications. When the requirement
for the proposed use shall exceed the credits, then such additional parking
shall be provided on site unless the Planning Commission has approved a
payment in lieu thereof as provided for in § 197-27 of this chapter. Fees
paid in lieu of providing on-site parking shall be noted on the approved site
development plan and thereafter credited as existing on-site parking.

B. Off-street parking requirements for other uses not listed above shall be
as determined by the Common Council and adopted as an amendment
to this chapter.
A. Where two or more different uses occur on a single lot, the total amount
of parking facilities to be provided shall be the sum of the requirements
for each individual use on the lot, except that the Board of Appeals may
approve the joint use of parking space by two or more establishments
on the same lot or on contiguous lots, the total capacity of which space
is less than the sum of the spaces required for each, provided that the
Board finds that the capacity to be provided will substantially meet the
intent of the requirements by reason of variation in the probable time of
maximum use by patrons or employees among such establishments, and
provided such approval of such joint use shall be automatically
terminated upon the termination of the operation of any such
establishments.
B. Where a hotel use contains 100 or more rooms and has a separate
accessory restaurant facility designed primarily for guests, the total
amount of parking facilities to be provided shall be the sum of the
requirements for each individual use but may be reduced to no less than
one parking space per guest sleeping room upon finding by the
Planning Commission, in a specific case, that a lesser requirement is in
accordance with good standard practice for the size and type of activity.
A. The required off-street parking facilities for structures and land uses
which are developed after § 197-28 becomes effective shall be provided
on the same lot or premises with such structure or land use; except that
off-street parking spaces required for structures or land uses on two
adjoining lots may be provided in a single common facility on one or
both of said lots.
B. Any driveway providing access to required off-street parking facilities
shall be graded and laid out as follows:
§ 197-28 RYE CODE § 197-30
187:936
(1) The grade of the driveway at the street property line shall be four
inches above the street grade at the center line of the driveway.
(2) The grade of the driveway shall not exceed 10% from the front
property line to the required front yard setback line or to a depth of
25 feet, whichever is greater.
(3) The alignment of the driveway shall be generally at right angles to
the street in this required depth.
(4) Where size of lot and topography permit, the driveway shall be so
arranged that cars entering onto a street may do so facing that
street.
C. In R-1 to RT Districts inclusive, no off-street parking facility shall be
developed within any required front yard or any required side yard
adjacent to a street line or within any other side or rear yard within five
feet of the lot line; except that for a corner lot existing on the effective
date of this section, the distance from the side street lot line may be
reduced to five feet where an existing house is so located on the lot that
the side street yard is less in width than the required front yard depth,
or where a proposed house cannot be so located on the lot as to provide
a side street yard equal in width to the required front yard depth and
still conform to the side yard requirements on the opposite side of the
house. [Amended 6-18-1968 by Ord. No. 3-1968]

of an existing building when submitted to the Building Inspector for a
building permit shall show specifically the location and size of the offstreet
parking facilities required to comply with this section and the
means of access to such space from the public street or highways; and
except for single-family and two-family residences, the plan for traffic
access, traffic circulation and general layout of the parking facility shall

The restrictions and regulations as to minimum lot size, minimum lot area
per family or equivalent, minimum lot width, maximum floor area ratio,
minimum residential floor area, maximum height, minimum dimensions of
front, side and rear yards, minimum usable open space, building spacing
and minimum dimensions of courts in the several districts shall be as set
forth in the Table of Regulations incorporated as Article VIII of this chapter,
except as hereinafter provided.
§ 197-33. Area and yard requirements applicable to only one
building.
No land area, yard or other open space provided about any building for the
purpose of complying with these regulations shall be included as any part
of the land area, yard or open space required for any other building; no
land area, yard or any other open space on one lot shall be considered as
land area, yard or open space for a building on any other lot. Should a lot
hereafter be formed from the part of a lot already occupied by a building,
such separation shall be effected in such manner as not to impair conformity
with any of these regulations with respect to the existing building and all
land area, yards and other required spaces in connection therewith, and no
permit shall be issued for the erection of a building on the new lot thus
created unless both lots comply with all the provisions of these regulations.
§ 197-34. Lot area requirements for combined uses.
In computing the lot area requirements for any structure in which
residential accommodations are combined with one or more nonresidential
permitted main uses, each 1,500 square feet of floor space devoted to such
nonresidential uses shall be counted as equivalent to one family unit.
§ 197-35. Parts of lot not counted toward requirements. [Amended

for the district in which it is located shall be counted as part of the
required lot area.
B. No portion of any watercourse or wetland (as defined by § 195-3 of the
Rye City Code) shall be counted as part of the required lot area nor
shall any such watercourse or wetland area be used in the ratio of floor
area to lot area calculation.

any residence structure, shall be erected on any part of the lot which has a
width of less than the distances specified in the table incorporated as Article
VIII, except as hereinafter provided.

The provisions of Article VIII shall not prevent the construction or alteration
of a single-family dwelling, provided that the yard requirements are
observed, on any lot in separate ownership which was duly recorded by
plan or deed or was assessed as a separate parcel prior to the effective
date of this section or on any lot in a subdivision approved by the Planning
Commission within five years prior to said date. Except in such a
subdivision, two or more contiguous lots in a single ownership on or after
such date shall be replotted to create one or more lots which will conform
to the above provisions. The Board of Appeals, however, if it finds that such
a reparceling or replotting cannot reasonably be done without creating or
retaining one or more lots that provide less than the required area or width,
may permit the construction of a single-family dwelling on such lot or lots.
The Board shall not permit any lesser dimensions than the following unless
more than 1/2 of the frontage on the same street block between the two
nearest intersecting streets is already built up at lower standards:

area of special flood hazard. [Added 2-3-1988 by L.L. No. 2-1988]
The provisions of Article VIII shall not prevent the construction or alteration
of a single-family dwelling on any lot in separate ownership which was
legally recorded by subdivision plat or deed and was assessed as a separate
parcel prior to February 17, 1988, that conforms to the requirements for
a lot not located in an area of special flood hazard. The Board of Appeals
§ 197-36 RYE CODE § 197-37.1
187:942
may permit the construction of a single-family dwelling on existing lots that
provide less than the area and width required for lots located outside of an
area of special flood hazard, provided that the Board shall not permit any
lesser dimensions than the following unless more than 1/2 of the frontage

The provisions of § 197-1, Definitions and usage, "lodging house" through
"lot width," and § 197-23 shall not prevent the construction, alteration
or expansion of a permitted main or accessory use, provided the yard
requirements are observed, on any lot in an undivided ownership prior
to the effective date of this section or any lot in a subdivision approved
by the Planning Commission within five years prior to said date which
is nonconforming due to the exclusion of a wetland or watercourse area
from allowed calculations as provided in the above-cited section, provided
that the proposed filling of a wetland or watercourse or the development
of such land created by such filling does not result in an increase in
permitted development beyond that which would have been allowed before
the dredging or filling. However, the exemptions of this section shall not
apply to a lot or parcel conveyed to the present or past owner as an
underwater land grant or to any illegally filled-in watercourse, and, further,
in the case of a subdivision approved more than five years prior to the
effective date of this section, two or more contiguous lots in a single
ownership shall be replotted to create one or more lots which conform to
the standards of this chapter.

Simultaneously with the approval of a subdivision plat, the Planning
Commission may either confirm the zoning regulations of the land so platted
as shown on the Official Zoning Map or create lots, by lot averaging or lot
grouping, with lesser area and dimensional requirements than permitted
in the Table of Regulations and require the owner to submit a plat which
reflects such change, which lots shall thenceforward be deemed
conforming, subject to the following limitations:
A. Lot averaging. The creation of one or more lots of lesser area and width
than are required in the Table of Regulations shall be permitted,
provided that the following conditions are met: [Amended 6-18-1975
by Ord. No. 3-1975]
(1) The area and width of no lot shall be reduced below the area and
width specified for each district in § 197-37.
(2) The average area and the average width of all lots shall be equal to
or greater than the minimum area and width required in the Table
of Regulations.
(3) Not more than 1/4 of the lots shall have areas and widths smaller
than the area and width specified in the Table of Regulations.
B. Lot grouping. The creation of lots of lesser area and dimensional
requirements than specified in the Table of Regulations shall be
permitted when the grouping of smaller lots will, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, improve the appearance of the subdivision,
contribute to the attractiveness of the neighborhood, preserve areas of
open space, protect or enhance wetlands or reduce the exposure of
residences to flood hazards for recreational, scenic, safety or ecological
purposes, provided that the following conditions are met: [Added

(1) The property proposed to be subdivided is located in an R-1, R-2,
R-3, R-4, R-5 or R-6 One-Family Zoning District and has an area of
three acres or more.
(2) The number of lots shall not exceed the number the Planning
Commission has determined would be approved if the property
were subdivided in the conventional manner, based on a review of a
conventional layout supplied by the subdivider. The Commission, in
determining the permitted number of lots, shall take into
consideration provisions of the Land Subdivision Regulations106
concerning the reservation of land for park and playground
purposes and shall require the reservation of such land or a cash
payment in lieu thereof.

that the area and dimensional requirements shall conform to the
single-family requirements of the next-less-restrictive residence
district and, in the case of subdivisions which will protect or
enhance wetlands or reduce the exposure of residences to flood
hazards, then to the requirements of the next two less-restrictive
residence district, as specified in the Table A of the Table of
Regulations, and, further, the Planning Commission may waive the
requirements of § 197-51 when both of the affected lots will directly
abut lands in the subdivision which will be preserved as open
space. [Amended 5-2-1990 by L.L. No. 10-1990]
(4) The open space to be preserved is shown on the approved
subdivision plat with a notation that such land is to be covenanted
as permanent open space in the ownership of the owners of the
subdivided lots and is provided in such a manner that it is available
for use by all residents of the subdivision.
(5) The open space to be preserved has an area equal to or greater
than 30% of the total area of the land to be subdivided and shall
exclude all lands shown on the approved plat as building lots,
public and private rights-of-way created as part of the subdivision,
and land, if any, reserved for conventional park and playground
purposes.
(6) The land to be preserved as open space is restricted by deed or
covenant to scenic, recreational and ecological activities and to
facilities designed for common use, which shall include buildings,
structures and man-made surfaces as are approved by the Planning
Commission, provided that such facilities constructed for common
use do not have an aggregate gross floor area in excess of 1/2 of 1%
of the area of such land or cover more than 10% of the area of such
land and conform to the setback and related restrictions governing
active recreational facilities located on lands to be reserved for
park and playground purposes set forth in § 170-17A(3) of this
Code. The Planning Commission may modify these requirements
where, in its judgment, it deems such modifications desirable and
appropriate because of characteristics of the specific site, such as
topography, size, shape and location, and proximity to facilities
such as streets, schools, public buildings and facilities, other
recreational facilities and similar active use areas. [Amended

the Planning Commission finds that the size and shape of the house
will not significantly differ from the size and shape of the houses to
be developed on other lots in the subdivision.

No person shall develop any lot or plot created after August 1, 1961, or
erect any permanent building thereon, without first obtaining approval of
the Planning Commission of the proposed lot arrangement and the proposed
methods of providing water and sanitary and storm sewerage facilities and
physical access for each of the said lots or plots, except as provided for

gross floor area authorized in the permit as granted but not constructed
initially shall be deemed to be authorized for later construction within a
period of 10 years from the date of the issuance of the permit, regardless of
reductions in lot area resulting from taking of parts of the lot for public use,
provided such takings do not reduce the aggregate lot area by more than

§ 197-43.1. Floor area ratio for oversized properties. [Added
7-16-2003 by L.L. No. 6-2003107]
The floor area ratio for single-family residences located in one-family
districts (i.e., R-1 through R-6) as set forth in Article VIII, Tables of
Regulations, § 197-86, shall be reduced to 1/2 of that portion of a property
exceeding 150%, but less than 250% of the minimum lot area for the district
in which the property is situated. The floor area ratio as set forth in Article
VIII, Tables of Regulations, § 197-86, shall be further reduced to 1/4 of
that portion of a property exceeding 250% of the minimum lot area for
the district in which the property is situated. For example, a property of
122,000 square feet (approximately 2.8 acres) in the R-1 District would be
permitted to build a total of 13,559 square feet of floor area. The R-1 District
has a minimum lot area of 43,560 square feet (one acre) and a maximum
FAR of 0.15. To calculate the maximum permitted floor area, the first 150%
of the minimum lot area of the R-1 District (43,560 x 1.5 = 65,340) would
apply the FAR of 0.15, resulting in 9,801 square feet of floor area (65,340
x 0.15 = 9,801). The next 100% of minimum lot area of the R-1 District (or
43,560 square feet) would apply an FAR reduced to one-half (0.15 x 0.50 =
0.075), resulting in 3,267 square feet of floor area (43,560 x 0.075 = 3,267).
The remaining 13,100 square feet of lot area (122,000 - 65,340 - 43,560 =
13,100) would apply an FAR reduced to one-quarter (0.15 x 0.25 = 0.0375),
resulting in 491 square feet of floor area (13,100 x 0.0375 = 491). Total floor
permitted floor area would be 13,559 square feet (9,801 + 3,267 + 491 =
13,559).
§ 197-43.2. Calculation of floor area for single-family residences.
[Added 7-16-2003 by L.L. No. 6-2003108]
The gross floor area for single-family residences located in one-family
districts (i.e., R-1 through R-6) shall be the sum of the horizontal areas of all
floors, roofed or covered areas of a residence measured from the exterior of
the outside walls. Certain other space shall be counted in the computation
of gross floor area for single-family residences as follows:
A. Voids. Any interior floor area, excluding stairways, with a floor-toceiling
height in excess of 14 feet shall be counted twice. In the case of
a sloped ceiling, only that portion of the interior floor area shall be
counted twice where a theoretical floor above such floor area could be
provided and the headroom above such theoretical floor (excluding
headroom associated with a sloped ceiling) exceeds seven feet, six
inches and the width between existing or theoretical five-foot high knee
walls exceeds seven feet.

attached to a building where 80% of the outer limits of the area under
the porch ceiling, to a point three feet, six inches above the floor of the
roofed area, is open to air and having no solid material. Walls, screens,
glass, lattice or other similar materials, as well as structural or
architectural elements, shall be considered a solid material. Any roofed
structure associated with the storage of vehicles such as a carport or
porte cochere shall not be considered an unenclosed porch and shall be
included in the computation of gross floor area.
A. For a single-family house or for each dwelling unit of a two-family
house, 1,000 square feet.
B. For dwelling units in apartments or other buildings containing three or
more dwelling units, except in an RA-5 District, an average of 750

because of characteristics of the specific site, such as topography, size,
shape and location, and proximity to facilities such as streets, schools,
public buildings and facilities, other recreational facilities and similar
active use areas.

be located so that the primary entrance to the building, whether a main
entrance serving several dwelling units in the building or a separate
entrance to an individual dwelling unit in the building, is located on a side
of the building which is parallel to the street upon which the property has
frontage. Each building, whether principal or accessory, shall be at least 25
feet distant from any other building in the group, which distance shall be
measured in a straight line between the points of the buildings which are
nearest each other. In the case of principal buildings, no principal building
shall be located on the site such that another principal building on the
site will be located between it and the street upon which the property has
frontage, unless they are separated by a distance of not less than 75 feet,
which distance shall be measured in a straight line between the points
of the buildings which are nearest each other. The Planning Commission
may modify the strict application of the requirements of this section in a
specific case where it is demonstrated to the Planning Commission that said
modification will accomplish the following:

In any district, wherever any rooms in which persons live, sleep or work,
except stores or storage rooms, cannot be reasonably and adequately
lighted and ventilated from a street or from a side yard or rear yard
as required in this chapter, a court conforming to the provisions of the

shall decide any question or dispute as to the meaning or intent of any word,
phrase, provision, requirement or regulation contained in this chapter,
whether brought before it by any municipal officer or agency or by an
interested person.
§ 197-81. Appellate jurisdiction of Board. [Amended 3-19-1997 by
Ord. No. 3-1997]
A. Orders, requirements, decisions, interpretations, determinations. The
Board of Appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify
the order, requirement, decision, interpretation or determination
appealed from and shall make such order, requirement, decision,
interpretation or determination as in its opinion ought to have been
made in the matter by the administrative official charged with the
enforcement of such ordinance or local law and to that end shall have
all the powers of the administrative official from whose order,
requirement, decision, interpretation or determination the appeal is
taken.
B. Definitions. As used in this § 197-81, the following words shall have the
following meanings:
AREA VARIANCE  The authorization by the Zoning Board of Appeals
for the use of land in a manner which is not allowed by the dimensional
or physical requirements of the applicable zoning regulations.
USE VARIANCE  The authorization by the Zoning Board of Appeals
for the use of land for a purpose which is otherwise not allowed or is
prohibited by the applicable zoning regulations.
C. Use variances.
(1) The Board of Appeals, on appeal from the decision or determination
of the administrative official charged with the enforcement of such
ordinance or local law, shall have the power to grant use variances,
as defined herein.
(2) No such use variance shall be granted by a Board of Appeals
without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning
regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. In
order to prove such unnecessary hardship the applicant shall
demonstrate to the Board of Appeals that for each and every
§ 197-79 TREES § 197-81
187:959
permitted use under the zoning regulations for the particular
district where the property is located:
(a) The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that
lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent
financial evidence;
(b) The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is
unique and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood;
(c) The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood; and
(d) The alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(3) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of use variances, shall grant
the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate to
address the unnecessary hardship proven by the applicant and at
the same time preserve and protect the character of the
neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
D. Area variances.
(1) The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power, upon an appeal
from a decision or determination of the administrative official
charged with the enforcement of such ordinance or local law, to
grant area variances as defined herein.
(2) In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take
into consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is
granted, as weighed against the detriment to the health, safety and
welfare of the neighborhood or community by such grant. In
making such determination the Board shall also consider whether:
(a) Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by the granting of the area variance;
(b) The benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some
method feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than an area
variance;
(c) The requested area variance is substantial;
(d) The proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on
the physical or environmental conditions in the neighborhood
or district; and
(e) The alleged difficulty was self-created, which consideration
shall be relevant to the decision of the Board of Appeals but
shall not necessarily preclude the granting of the area
variance.
§ 197-81 RYE CODE § 197-81
187:960
(3) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of area variances, shall grant
the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate
and at the same time preserve and protect the character of the
neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
E. Imposition of conditions. The Board of Appeals shall, in the granting of
both use variances and area variances, have the authority to impose
such reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly related to
and incidental to the proposed use of the property. Such conditions
shall be consistent with the spirit and intent of the zoning ordinance or
local law and shall be imposed for the purpose of minimizing any
adverse impact such variance may have on the neighborhood or
community.
F. To facilitate public notification, the applicant shall prepare a public
notification list using the most current City of Rye Tax Maps and Tax
Assessment Roll, showing the Tax Map sheet, block and lot number, the
owner's name and the owner's mailing address for each property
located wholly or partially within 300 feet of the perimeter of the
property that is the subject of the application. The applicant shall
deliver a copy of the public notice provided by the City Clerk to all of
the property owners contained on the public notification list by mail in
accordance with the following requirements: [Amended 3-10-2010 by
L.L. No. 4-2010114]
(1) The mailing shall be limited solely to the public notice provided to
the applicant by the City Clerk.
(2) The public notice shall be mailed to all property owners by certified
mail with certificate of mailing (no return receipt necessary) at a
post office or official depository of the Postal Service, at least 10
days prior to the date of the public hearing.

public hearing, the City will publish a notice regarding the public
hearing in the official newspaper of the City. The applicant shall be

The Board of Appeals may in a specific case, after public notice and hearing
and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, determine and grant
special exceptions to the regulations herein established, in harmony with
their general purpose and intent, as follows:
A. Expansion of a nonconforming use: permit the expansion of
nonconforming uses or buildings upon the land occupied by such uses
at the time such uses become nonconforming or on land adjoining,
provided that such adjoining land was under the same ownership as the
land in question at that time and provided that there has been no
substitution of a new use for the original nonconforming use and
provided that such extension or extensions of nonconforming uses shall
not exceed in all 30% of the floor area of the building containing the
nonconforming use at the time it became nonconforming, and the
expansion or extension of a nonconforming use shall not exceed in all
an increase of 30% in the intensity of the use at the time it became
nonconforming, which percentage shall be related to number of
employees, hours of operation, number of vehicles or such other
characteristics or combination of characteristics as the Board of
Appeals determines as the most accurate measure of the intensity of
the particular use. In each case, the Board shall give consideration to
and make a finding that the following conditions prevail prior to
approving a special exemption:
(1) The expansion or extension will not have a significant adverse
impact on surrounding conforming development.
(2) Proposed off-street parking complies with the provisions of
§ 197-26.
(3) The use is not a use prohibited by the provisions of § 197-22.
B. Expansion into a more restricted district: permit the expansion of a use
or building, within the same lot as such lot existed at the time the
district boundary was established, into a contiguous more restricted
district, but in no case for a distance of more than 25 feet into the more
restricted district.
C. Substitution for a nonconforming use: permit a substitution for an
existing nonconforming use, provided that such substitution is in
accordance with the provisions of § 197-5A(2).
D. Construction of a single-family dwelling on a nonconforming lot: permit
the construction of a single-family dwelling on a lot that does not
§ 197-82 RYE CODE § 197-82
187:962
conform to the requirements of the district in which it is located,
subject to the provisions of § 197-37.
E. Joint use of parking space: approve the joint use of parking space as
provided in § 197-29.
F. Reduction of side yards and waiving of off-street parking requirements:
reduce to not less than eight feet the required side yards for a dwelling
proposed to be converted for up to four families in RA-1, RA-2, RA-3,
RA-4 and B-3 Districts, as provided in Article VIII, Tables of
Regulations, and waive off-street parking requirements for such
proposed conversions in RA-3 Districts where the Building Inspector
finds it impossible to provide the required parking.
G. Reduction of yard requirements as authorized under § 197-64.
H. Issue permits: grant a permit wherever it is provided in this chapter
that the approval of the Board of Appeals is required.
I. Permit the use of floor space in existing buildings in the B-2 Central
Business District which is in excess of the maximum permitted in the
district on the effective date of this chapter, provided that the total
usable space in the building will not exceed a floor-area-to-lot-area ratio
of 2.80 and the excess floor space will be used for a use permitted in the
district, which shall not include the expansion of a nonconforming use.
J. Permit reductions in the standards required by § 197-6.1 of this chapter
and Chapter 100 of this Code, subject to the requirements of § 197-37.1
of this chapter.
K. Permit the filming of movies, commercials, documentaries, serials,
shows, performances or other similar events and activities, including
still photography in excess of filming permitted as an accessory use,
subject to the following requirements and limitations:
(1) Such filming shall also be subject to the requirements of Chapter
93 of this Code.
(2) The Board shall deny any application for a special exception which
in its judgment will be detrimental to the neighborhood because of
anticipated excessive noise, illumination or other effect caused by
the proposed filming.

(c) For corner lots, corner side yards at least 1/5 of the lot width at the location of the building, but need not be more than front yard minimum, except as provided in § 197-62. Permitted nonresidential main uses shall have minimum side yard
1½ times width specified for a single-family house. (See § 197-52.)
(d) Twenty-five feet for any side yard containing a driveway serving more than six parking spaces. For a one- , two- or three-family structure existing on the effective date of the chapter (August 9, 1956) and proposed for conversion for up to
