consistent with the provisions known as the "Substantive Rules of
the New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing," the Uniform
Housing Affordability Controls ("UHAC"), N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.1 et seq.,
and the Borough's constitutional obligation to provide a fair share
of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households. In
addition, this chapter applies requirements for very-low-income
housing established in P.L. 2008, c. 46 (the "Roberts Bill").30
(2) This chapter is intended to assure that low- and moderate-income
units ("affordable units") are created with controls on affordability
over time and that low- and moderate-income households shall
occupy these units. This chapter shall apply except where
inconsistent with applicable law.
(3) The Borough of Harrington Park Planning Board has adopted a
Housing Element and Fair Share Plan pursuant to the Municipal
Land Use Law at N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. The Fair Share Plan has
been endorsed by the governing body. The Fair Share Plan
describes the ways Harrington Park Borough shall address its fair
share for low- and moderate-income housing as determined by the
Superior Court and documented in the Housing Element.
(4) This chapter implements and incorporates the Fair Share Plan and
addresses the requirements of the Act and regulations thereunder,
as may be amended and supplemented.

and place the reports on its municipal website. Any plan evaluation

(a) The municipality may file a court action pursuant to N.J.S.A.
2A:58-11 alleging a violation, or violations, of the regulations
governing the affordable housing unit. If the owner, developer
§ 85-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 85-2

or tenant is found by the court to have violated any provision of
the regulations governing affordable housing units, the owner,
developer or tenant shall be subject to one or more of the
following penalties, at the discretion of the court:
[1] A fine of not more than $500 or imprisonment for a period

and specific violation of these provisions and not as a
continuing offense.

moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations
governing affordable housing units, payment into the
Harrington Park Borough affordable housing trust fund of
the gross amount of rent illegally collected.
[3] In the case of an owner who has rented his or her low- or
moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations
governing affordable housing units, payment of an
innocent tenant's reasonable relocation costs, as
determined by the court.
(b) The municipality may file a court action in the Superior Court
seeking a judgment, which would result in the termination of
the owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of
a mortgage foreclosure. Any judgment shall be enforceable as
if the same were a judgment of default of the First Purchase
Money Mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the lowand
moderate-income unit.
(3) Such judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the
municipality, by means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at which
time the low- and moderate-income unit of the violating owner shall
be sold at a sale price which is not less than the amount necessary
to fully satisfy and pay off any First Purchase Money Mortgage and
prior liens and the costs of the enforcement proceedings incurred
by the municipality, including attorney's fees. The violating owner
shall have the right to possession terminated as well as the title
conveyed pursuant to the Sheriff's sale.
(4) The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to satisfy the
First Purchase Money Mortgage lien and any prior liens upon the
low- and moderate-income unit. The excess, if any, shall be applied
to reimburse the municipality for any and all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with either the court action resulting in the
judgment of violation or the Sheriff's sale. In the event that the
proceeds from the Sheriff's sale are insufficient to reimburse the
municipality in full as aforesaid, the violating owner shall be
personally responsible for and to the extent of such deficiency, in
addition to any and all costs incurred by the municipality in
§ 85-2 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 85-2
1:90
connection with collecting such deficiency. In the event that a
surplus remains after satisfying all of the above, such surplus, if
any, shall be placed in escrow by the municipality for the owner and
shall be held in such escrow for a maximum period of two years
or until such earlier time as the owner shall make a claim with the
municipality for such. Failure of the owner to claim such balance
within the two-year period shall automatically result in a forfeiture
of such balance to the municipality. Any interest accrued or earned
on such balance while being held in escrow shall belong to and
shall be paid to the municipality, whether such balance shall be
paid to the owner or forfeited to the municipality.
(5) Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the regulations
governing affordable housing units shall not extinguish the
restrictions of the regulations governing affordable housing units
as the same apply to the low- and moderate-income unit. Title shall
be conveyed to the purchaser at the Sheriff's sale, subject to the
restrictions and provisions of the regulations governing the
affordable housing unit. The owner determined to be in violation of
the provisions of this plan and from whom title and possession were
taken by means of the Sheriff's sale shall not be entitled to any
right of redemption.
(6) If there are no bidders at the Sheriff's sale, or if insufficient
amounts are bid to satisfy the First Purchase Money Mortgage and
any prior liens, the municipality may acquire title to the low- and
moderate-income unit by satisfying the First Purchase Money
Mortgage and any prior liens and crediting the violating owner
with an amount equal to the difference between the First Purchase
Money Mortgage and any prior liens and costs of the enforcement
proceedings, including legal fees and the maximum resale price for
which the low- and moderate-income unit could have been sold
under the terms of the regulations governing affordable housing
units. This excess shall be treated in the same manner as the excess
which would have been realized from an actual sale as previously
described.
(7) Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold at
the Sheriff's sale or acquired by the municipality shall obligate the
owner to accept an offer to purchase from any qualified purchaser
which may be referred to the owner by the municipality, with such
offer to purchase being equal to the maximum resale price of the
low- and moderate-income unit as permitted by the regulations
governing affordable housing units.
(8) The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable for
complying with the terms and restrictions governing affordable
housing units until such time as title is conveyed from the owner.
D. The Borough may contract with or authorize a consultant, authority,
government or any agency charged by the Borough Council, which
§ 85-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 85-2
1:91
entity shall have the responsibility of administering the affordable
housing program of the Borough. If the Borough contracts with another
entity to administer all or any part of the affordable housing program,
including the affordability controls and affirmative marketing plan,
the Municipal Housing Liaison shall supervise the contracting
administrative agent. The administrative agent shall have authority
to take all actions necessary and appropriate to carry out its
responsibilities hereunder.
E. The cost for administering the affordable housing program for
Harrington Park Borough, including affirmative marketing, household
certification, affordability controls, resale and rentals, communicating

the following fee schedule, as may be amended from time to time:

new tenant).
(4) Sale of new affordable housing units: $200 per unit setup, plus

(5) Rental of new affordable housing units: $400 per unit setup, plus
$500 per unit certification fee, plus $3,000 minimum project fee
(payable at least 180 days prior to the issuance of a temporary or
permanent certificate of occupancy, whichever first occurs).
(6) Refinancing: $200 to be paid by unit owner.
(7) Lien satisfaction: no charge.
(8) Other programs. The cost to provide compliance services for
programs, such as accessory apartments, market to affordable,
etc., are subject to the number of units and the scope of services
required for each.

or required to comply with the affirmative marketing requirements,
the rate for such services shall be determined prior to
implementation.
(10) Reimbursement of expenses. In addition to the foregoing fees, cost
of postage, printing of notices, copying costs, and advertising shall

A. Purpose. In Holmdel Builder's Association v. Holmdel Township, 121
N.J. 550 (1990), the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that
mandatory development fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of
1985, N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et seq., and the State Constitution, subject to
COAH developing rules as amended from time to time and/or in
accordance with the enacted legislation and/or in accordance with
directives from the courts. The purpose of this section is to establish
standards for the collection, maintenance and expenditure of
development fees pursuant to the above. Fees collected pursuant to this
section shall be used for the sole purpose of providing low- and
moderate-income housing.
§ 85-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 85-5
1:101
B. Development fees.
(1) Residential development fees.
(a) Within all zone districts, unless invalidated by state statute or
court order, developers of residential housing, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted
below, shall pay a fee of 1 1/2% of the equalized assessed value
for residential development, when no increased density is
permitted.
(b) When an increase in residential density has been permitted
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d (known as a "d" variance) or
pursuant to zoning amendment or pursuant to the adoption of a
redevelopment plan pursuant to the New Jersey Local
Redevelopment and Housing Law (N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et seq.),
developers shall be required to pay a residential development
fee of a maximum of 6% of the equalized assessed value for
each additional unit that may be realized.
(c) Affordable housing developments and residential
developments where the developer is providing for the
construction of affordable units elsewhere in the municipality
shall be exempt from residential development fees.
(d) Residential developments that have received preliminary or
final site plan approval prior to the adoption of a municipal
residential development fee shall be exempt from residential
development fees, unless the developer seeks a substantial
change in the approval or the developer has accepted
responsibility to pay a residential development fee. Where a
site plan approval does not apply, a zoning and/or building
permit shall be synonymous with preliminary or final site plan
approval for this purpose. A development fee shall be based on
the percentage that applies on the date that a building permit
is issued, regardless of the time of collection of the fee.
(e) Owner-occupied residential structures demolished and
replaced as a result of a fire, flood, or natural disaster shall be
exempt from paying a residential development fee.
(f) Residential development fees shall be imposed and collected
when an existing structure undergoes a change to a more
intense use. The development fee shall be calculated on the
increase in the equalized assessed value of the improved
structure.
(g) A developer of an addition to an existing single-family
residential unit which constitutes less than a 50% increase in
the gross floor area of the unit shall be exempt from the
development fee.
§ 85-5 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 85-5
1:102
(2) Nonresidential development fees.
(a) Within all zoning districts, unless invalidated by state statute
or court order, nonresidential developers, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted,
shall pay a nonresidential development fee equal to 2 1/2% of
the equalized assessed value of the land and improvements for
all new nonresidential construction.
(b) Nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types
of development specifically exempted, shall also pay a
nonresidential development fee equal to 2 1/2% of the increase
in equalized assessed value resulting from any additions to
existing structures to be used for nonresidential purposes.
(c) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an
existing structure is demolished and replaced. Whenever
nonresidential development is situated on real property that
has been previously developed with a building, structure, or
other improvement, the nonresidential development fee shall
be equal to 2 1/2% of the equalized assessed value of the land
and improvements on the property where the nonresidential
development is situated at the time the final certificate of
occupancy is issued, less the equalized assessed value of the
land and improvements on the property where the
nonresidential development is situated, as determined by the
tax assessor of the municipality at the time the developer or
owner, including any previous owners, first sought approval for
a construction permit, including, but not limited to, demolition
permits, pursuant to the State Uniform Construction Code, or
approval under the Municipal Land Use Law, P.L. 1975, c. 291
(N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.). If the calculation required under
this section results in a negative number, the nonresidential
development fee shall be zero.
(d) The nonresidential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or
market-rate development shall be subject to the 2 1/2%
development fee, unless otherwise exempted below.
(e) The 2 1/2% fee shall not apply to an increase in equalized
assessed value resulting from alterations, change in use within
existing footprint, reconstruction, renovations and repairs.

nonresidential development fee pursuant to this section,
provided that the property continues to maintain its tax-
§ 85-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 85-5
1:103

three years from the date of issuance of the certificate of
occupancy. In addition, the following shall be exempt from
the imposition of a nonresidential development fee:

shall make the payment of the nonresidential development fee,
in that event, within three years after that event or after the
issuance of the final certificate of occupancy of the
nonresidential development, whichever is later.
(h) If a property which was exempted from the collection of a
nonresidential development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt
from property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit
§ 85-5 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 85-5
1:104
the fees required pursuant to this section within 45 days of
the termination of the property tax exemption. Unpaid

may be enforceable by the Borough of Harrington Park as a
lien against the real property of the owner.

final inspection, the Municipal Assessor shall confirm or modify
the previously estimated equalized assessed value of the
improvements of the development, calculate the development
fee and thereafter notify the developer of the amount of the
fee.
(g) Should the Borough of Harrington Park fail to determine or
notify the developer of the amount of the development fee

issuance of a certificate of occupancy for such development. A
final certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for any
nonresidential development until such time as the fee imposed

ARTICLE I
Commercial or Industrial Property
[Adopted 7-16-1990 by Ord. No. 429]
§ 118-1. Legislative findings.
The Mayor and Council of the Borough find as a fact that there exists a
potential threat and danger to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens
of the Borough when a change in or a transfer of ownership, tenancy,
occupation or use of a commercial or industrial property takes place and
when such change or transfer results in a new occupation or use different
from that of the business, occupation or use previously inspected as a
condition precedent to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, which new
use may involve procedures, fabrications or the storage of materials which
present a fire, health or other danger. The Mayor and Council recognize
this potential danger and deem it desirable, in the best interests of fulfilling
their governmental responsibility and in the best interests of the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of the community, to correct said problem.
§ 118-2. Certificate of continued occupancy required.
From the effective date of this article, no commercial or industrial premises,
or portion thereof, whether in a commercial or industrial zone or in a
different zone by reason of being a nonconforming use, shall be sold, re-let
or re-rented and thereafter occupied by a new owner, tenant or subtenant
without the issuance, pursuant to an appropriate application therefor, of a
certificate of continued occupancy.
§ 118-3. Application for certificate.44
The owner, tenant or subtenant of commercial or industrial premises about
to be newly occupied by such owner, tenant or subtenant, or his/her
respective agent, shall apply to the Construction Code Official of the
Borough for a certificate of continued occupancy and shall supply as
required information on said application all facts relating to the nature of
the business, occupation or industry to be conducted on the premises, the
manufacturing or other processes involved and the nature of all materials
to be stored in or on the premises as part of or pertinent to said business,
occupation or use. Upon receipt of said application, the Construction Code
Official shall review the same within 10 days with the Fire Protection
Subcode Official, Health Officer and other subcode officials as deemed
necessary by the Construction Code Official and shall either issue a
certificate of continued occupancy or a written statement of the reason or
reasons for a denial of the same.

and redirection/removal of sump pumps out of sanitary sources. Any
construction work for which a Uniform Construction Code permit was
issued shall be inspected and closed. A certificate of smoke detector
installation shall be issued by the Harrington Park Fire Prevention Bureau
before a certificate of continued occupancy may be issued.
§ 118-8. Responsibility of owner for application.47
The current owner, landlord, prospective buyer/tenant or any agent of any
residential premises about to be sold, transferred or newly occupied shall
apply for a certificate of continued occupancy provided by the Harrington
Park Construction Department.
§ 118-9. Temporary certificate of continued occupancy.
A temporary certificate of continued occupancy may be issued at the
request of the owner, landlord, prospective buyer/tenant or any agent
thereof, provided that a suitable escrow is established to cover any and

ARTICLE I
Statutory Authorization; Findings of Fact; Purpose and Objectives
§ 179-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has, in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and Council of the Borough of
Harrington Park, of Bergen County, New Jersey, does ordain as follows.
§ 179-2. Findings of fact.
§ 179-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. The flood hazard areas of the Borough of Harrington Park are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
§ 179-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 179-3
1:175
§ 179-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common
usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
AH ZONE  Areas subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance
shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Base flood elevations (BFEs) derived from
detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in this zone.
AO ZONE  Areas subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance
shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average
depths are between one and three feet.
APPEAL  A request for a review of the Construction Code Official's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO or AH zone on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percent annual
or greater chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  Land in the floodplain within a
community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. It is shown on the FIRM as Zone V, VE, V1-30, A, AO, A1-A30,
AE, A99, or AH.
BASE FLOOD  A flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE)  The flood elevation shown on a
published Flood Insurance Study (FIS) including the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM). For zones AE, AH, AO, and A1-30, the elevation represents
the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one-percent or
greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL  A wall that is not part of the structural support of
the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse
under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated
portion of the building or supporting foundation system.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or
storage of equipment or materials located within the area of special flood
hazard.
§ 179-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 179-5
1:177
ELEVATED BUILDING 
EROSION  The process of gradual wearing away of land masses.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION  A
manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to
be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain
management regulations adopted by a community.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM)  The official map on which the
Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special
flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS)  The official report in which the
Federal Insurance Administration has provided flood profiles, as well as the
Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.
FLOOD or FLOODING  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS  Zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose
ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion
control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term
describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which
provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and
reduction.
FLOODPROOFING  Any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
A nonbasement building:
Built, in the case of a building in an area of special flood hazard,
to have the top of the elevated floor elevated above the base flood
elevation plus freeboard by means of piling, columns (posts and
piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water; and
(1)
Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of
the building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base flood.
(2)
A.
In an area of special flood hazard, "elevated building" also includes a
building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls
with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of
floodwaters.
B.
A. The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.

flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY  The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without accumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than
0.2 foot.
FREEBOARD  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and

B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing
Subsection A(4)(a) through (k) has been fully considered. As the lot
size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
§ 179-15 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 179-15
1:188
or victimization of the public as identified in Subsection A(4),
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

Borough of Harrington Park, a Planning Board of seven members consisting
of the following four classes:

[Amended 4-18-2011 by Ord. No. 658]
B. Class II: one of the officials of the municipality other than a member of
the governing body to be appointed by the Mayor, provided that if there
be an Environmental Commission, the member of the Environmental
Commission who is also a member of the Planning Board as required by
Section 1 of P.L. 1968, c. 245 (N.J.S.A. 40:56A-1), shall be deemed to be
the Class II Planning Board member for purposes of N.J.S.A. 40:56A-1 in
the event that there be among the Class IV or alternate members of the
Planning Board both a member of the Zoning Board of Adjustment and a
member of the Board of Education. [Amended 5-16-1988 by Ord. No.
396]
C. Class III: a member of the governing body to be appointed by it.
D. Class IV: four other citizens of the municipality to be appointed by the
Mayor. The members of Class IV shall hold no other municipal office,
position or employment. No member of the Board of Education may be a
Class IV member of the Planning Board. If there be a Municipal
Environmental Commission, the member of the Environmental
Commission who is also a member of the Planning Board as required by
Section 1 of P.L. 1968, c. 245 (N.J.S.A. 40:56A-1), shall be a Class IV
Planning Board member unless there be among the Class IV or
alternate members of the Planning Board both a member of the Zoning
Board of Adjustment or Historic Preservation Commission and a
member of the Board of Education, in which case the member common
to the Planning Board and Municipal Environmental Commission shall
be deemed a Class II member of the Planning Board. For the purpose of
this subsection, membership on a municipal board or commission
whose function is advisory in nature and the establishment of which is
discretionary and not required by statute shall not be considered the
holding of municipal office. [Amended 5-16-1988 by Ord. No. 396]
E. In addition, there shall be appointed to the Planning Board two
alternate members designated as Alternate No. 1 and Alternate No. 2.

serve for the period prescribed by statute so long as long as they
remain qualified members of their respective boards. The first

on a matter due to the member's personal or financial interest therein,
regular members of the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall be called upon to
serve, for that matter only, as temporary members of the Planning Board in
order of seniority of continuous service to the Zoning Board of Adjustment
until there are the minimum number of members necessary to constitute a
quorum to act upon the matter without any personal or financial interest

regular members of equal seniority, the Chairperson of the Zoning Board
shall make the choice.

Ord. No. 658]
B. The terms of the members composing Class II and Class III shall be for
one year or terminate at the completion of their respective terms of

member of the Environmental Commission. The term of a Class II or
Class IV member who is also a member of the Environmental
Commission shall be for three years or terminate at the completion of
the member's term of office as a member of the Environmental
Commission, whichever occurs first. [Amended 5-16-1988 by Ord.
No. 396]
C. As terms of Class IV members holding office on the effective date of this
chapter expire, all subsequent Class IV members shall be appointed for
terms of four years except as otherwise herein provided. The term of a
Class IV member who is also a member of the Zoning Board of
Adjustment, or Board of Education, shall terminate whenever he is no
longer a member of such other body or at the completion of his Class IV
term, whichever occurs first. The terms of all Class IV members first
appointed under this chapter shall be so determined that to the greatest
practicable extent the expiration of such terms shall be distributed
evenly over the first four years after their appointment; provided that
the initial Class IV term of no member shall exceed four years.
Thereafter, the Class IV term of each such member shall be four years.

(3) Where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape
of a specific piece of property, or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions or physical features uniquely affecting a
specific piece of property or the structures lawfully existing
thereon, the strict application of any regulation in Chapter 350,

be advanced by a deviation from the zoning requirements and
the benefits of the deviation would substantially outweigh any
detriment, grant a variance to allow departure from regulations

that a proposed use is an inherently beneficial use shall not be
dispositive of a decision on a variance under this subsection, and

Subsection A(4) of this section shall be granted under this
subsection, and provided further that the proposed development
does not require approval by the Planning Board of a subdivision,

to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-60; provided, however, that: [Amended
5-16-1988 by Ord. No. 396; 4-18-2011 by Ord. No. 658]
(a) No variance shall be granted under this subsection to allow a

Planning Board in connection with subdivision review, site plan
review or conditional use approval.

Chapter 350, Zoning, to permit (i) a use or principal structure in a

B. No variance or other relief may be granted under the terms of this
section, including a variance or other relief involving an inherently
beneficial use, without a showing that such variance or other relief can

Chapter 350, Zoning. In respect to any airport hazard areas delineated
under the Air Safety and Hazardous Zoning Act of 1983, P.L. 1983, c.
260 (N.J.S.A. 6:1-80 et seq.), no variance or other relief may be granted

provided that such reference shall not extend the period of time within
which the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall act. [Amended 5-16-1988

drainageway, flood control basin or public area reserved on the Official
Map.

(a) Such variance is approved by a majority of the full authorized
membership of the Board.
(b) Unless a variance is granted, the parcel or parcels of land on
which the mapped street, drainageway, flood control basin or
reserved area is located cannot yield a reasonable return to the
owner.
(c) The variance required will cause the least practicable increase
in the cost of opening the street or will tend to cause the least
change in the Official Map.
(2) The Board shall impose such reasonable requirements as
conditions for granting such a variance as will promote the health,
morals, safety and general welfare of the public.
C. Grant variances from the requirements of law that no permit for the
erection of any building or structure be issued unless the lot abuts a

variance shall be granted only if the enforcement of such requirements
of law would entail practical difficulties or undue hardship or where
the circumstances of the case do not require the building or structure
to be related to a street. Such variances may be granted subject to
conditions that will provide adequate access for firefighting equipment,
ambulances and other emergency vehicles necessary for the protection
of health and safety and that will protect any future street layout shown
on the Official Map or on a general Circulation Plan Element of the
Master Plan.
A. Appeals to the Zoning Board of Adjustment may be taken by any

case may be, stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action in respect of
which the decision appealed from was made, unless the Construction Code
Official certifies to the Zoning Board of Adjustment or the governing body,
as the case may be, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with
the Construction Code Official or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case
may be, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in the
opinion of the Construction Code Official or Zoning Board of Adjustment,
as the case may be, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by an order of the Superior Court
of New Jersey on application or notice to the officer or Board from whom or
which the appeal is taken and on good cause shown.

ARTICLE I
Plastic Bags, Straws and Stirrers and Polystyrene Containers
[Adopted 9-9-2019 by Ord. No. 737]
§ 245-1. Purpose.
The Borough of Harrington Park ("Borough") and its Environmental
Commission are committed to protecting the environment and the public
health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, the watershed and surrounding
waterways. The goal of this article is to reduce the common use of singleuse
plastic bags, plastic straws, plastic stirrers and polystyrene foam food
packaging containers and to encourage the use of reusable bags by
consumers, paper straws, wooden or bamboo stirrers and more sustainable/
recyclable packaging containers by retailers, thereby reducing local land
and water pollution, advancing solid waste reduction, protecting the
Borough's unique natural beauty and irreplaceable natural resources, and
improving the quality of life for the citizens of the Borough.
§ 245-2. Findings.
A. Single-use plastic bags, plastic straws, plastic stirrers and polystyrene
foam food packaging containers are an environmental nuisance;
adversely affect public health; are a detriment to the watershed and
waterways surrounding our Borough; and impair the overall quality of
life of the Borough's residents and visitors.
(1) Because plastic bags, plastic straws, plastic stirrers and
polystyrene foam food packaging containers are lightweight, they
easily become airborne even when properly disposed of, littering
the waterways, roadsides and sidewalks. They clog storm drainage
systems, contribute to water and terrestrial pollution, and detract
from the natural beauty of the Borough.
(2) Plastic bags, plastic straws, plastic stirrers and polystyrene foam
food products photo-degrade, disintegrating into minute particles
which adsorb toxins and pose a threat to riparian and marine
environments, contaminating the food chain, water and soil. They
are also a menace to marine life, killing birds, marine mammals,
sea turtles and fish each year. Polystyrene foam also contains toxic
substances, styrene and benzene, which are known carcinogens
and neurotoxins that are hazardous to humans.
(3) The vast majority of plastic bags, plastic straws, plastic stirrers and
polystyrene foam food packaging containers are not recycled, and
recycling of plastic bags, plastic straws, plastic stirrers and
polystyrene foam food packaging containers is not available in the
Borough of Harrington Park. Their disposal adds to the Borough's
waste management expense, both through the cost of transporting
waste to landfills and due to their contamination of the singlestream
recycling system.
§ 245-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 245-2
1:255
§ 245-3. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings

either petroleum or a biologically based polymer, such as corn or other
plant sources. "Plastic stirrer" includes compostable and biodegradable
petroleum or a biologically based polymer stirrers, but does not include
stirrers that are made from nonplastic materials, such as paper, sugar cane,
bamboo, etc.

petrochemical materials utilizing a styrene monomer and processed by
any number of techniques including, but not limited to, fusion of polymer
spheres (expandable bead polystyrene) injection molding, foam molding,
and extrusion-blow molding (extruded foam polystyrene). Polystyrene foam
is generally used to make such things as cups, bowls, plates, trays,
clamshell containers, prepared food take-out containers, meat trays, and
egg cartons.
PRODUCT BAG  A flexible container made of very thin plastic material
with a single opening that is used to transport dry cleaning materials,

100% recyclable.
B. Single-use plastic bags, plastic straws, plastic stirrers and polystyrene
foam food packaging container ordinances have proven to be effective

growing global movement towards sustainability.

RETAIL SALES  The transfer to a customer of goods in exchange for

§ 284-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the intensity of use in areas
of steeply sloping terrain in order to limit soil loss, erosion, excessive
stormwater runoff and the degradation of surface water and to maintain the
natural topography and drainage patterns of land.
§ 284-2. Findings.
Disturbance of steep slopes results in accelerated erosion processes from
stormwater runoff and the subsequent sedimentation of water bodies with
the associated degradation of water quality and loss of aquatic life support.
Related effects include soil loss, changes in natural topography and
drainage patterns, increased flooding potential, further fragmentation of
forest and habitat areas, and compromised aesthetic values. It has become
widely recognized that disturbance of steep slopes should be restricted or
prevented based on the impact disturbance of steep slopes can have on
water quality and quantity and the environmental integrity of landscapes.
§ 284-3. Applicability.
This chapter shall be applicable to new development or land disturbance on
a steep slope within the Borough of Harrington Park.
§ 284-4. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
DISTURBANCE  The placement of impervious surface, the exposure or
movement of soil or bedrock, or the clearing, cutting, or removing of
vegetation.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE  Any structure, surface, or improvement that
reduces or prevents absorption of stormwater into land, and includes
porous paving, paver blocks, gravel, crushed stone, decks, patios, elevated
structures, and other similar structures, surfaces, or improvements.
§ 280-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 284-4
1:293
REDEVELOPMENT  The construction of structures or improvements on
areas which previously contained structures or other improvements.
STEEP SLOPES  Any slope equal to or greater than 20% as measured over
any minimum run of 10 feet. Steep slopes are determined based on contour
intervals of two feet or less.
§ 284-5. Designation of areas.
The percent of slope (rise in feet per horizontal distance) shall be
established by measurement of distance perpendicular to the contour of the
slope. The percent of slope shall be calculated for each two-foot contour
interval. For example, any location on the site where there is a one-foot
rise over a ten-foot horizontal run constitutes a ten-percent slope; a oneand-
five-tenths-foot rise over a ten-foot horizontal run constitutes a fifteenpercent
slope; and a two-foot rise over a ten-foot horizontal run constitutes
a twenty-percent slope.
§ 284-6. Steep slope limits.
For steep slopes, any disturbance shall be prohibited except as provided
below:
§ 284-7. Conflicts and interpretation.
A. Redevelopment within the limits of existing impervious surfaces; and
B. New disturbance necessary to protect public health, safety or welfare,
such as necessary linear development with no feasible alternative; to
provide an environmental benefit, such as remediation of a
contaminated site; to prevent extraordinary hardship on the property
owner peculiar to the property; or to prevent extraordinary hardship,
provided that the hardship was not created by the property owner, that
would not permit a minimum economically viable use of the property
based upon reasonable investment. For example, redevelopment within
the footprint of existing impervious cover should be allowed to support
efforts to revitalize development that has fallen into disrepair. The
applicant shall demonstrate through site plans depicting proposed
development and topography that new disturbance is not located in
areas with a twenty-percent or greater slope.
A. Conflicts. All other ordinances, parts of ordinances, or other local
requirements that are inconsistent or in conflict with this chapter are
hereby superseded to the extent of any inconsistency or conflict, and
the provisions of this chapter shall apply.
B. Interpretation.
(1) This chapter shall be so construed as not to conflict with any
provision of New Jersey or federal law.
§ 284-4 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 284-7
1:294
§ 284-8. Enforcement; violation and penalties.108
A prompt investigation shall be made by the appropriate personnel of
Borough of Harrington Park of any person or entity believed to be in
violation hereof. If, upon inspection, a condition which is in violation of this
chapter is discovered, a civil action may be initiated in the Special Part of
the Superior Court, or in the Superior Court, if the primary relief sought is
injunctive or if penalties may exceed the jurisdictional limit of the special
civil part, by the filing and serving of appropriate process. Nothing in this
chapter shall be construed to preclude the right of Borough of Harrington
Park, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 26:3A2-25, to initiate legal proceedings
hereunder in Municipal Court. The violation of any section or subsection
of this chapter shall constitute a separate and distinct offense independent
of the violation of any other section or subsection or of any order issued
pursuant to this chapter. Each day a violation continues shall be considered
a separate offense. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this
article shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to the penalties in Chapter
164, Fines and Penalties, in the discretion of the court.
§ 284-9. Effective date.
This chapter shall take effect upon final adoption and publication in
accordance with the law on April 21, 2014.

§ 284-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 286-1
1:295
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural BMPs. Structural BMPs should be
integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and
proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater
recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for major
development, as defined in § 286-2.
C. Applicability.
(1) This chapter shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions
for the following major developments that require preliminary or
final site plan or subdivision review:
(a) Nonresidential major developments; and
(b) Aspects of residential major developments that are not
preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) This chapter shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the Borough of Harrington Park.
D. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant
to this chapter are to be considered an integral part of development
approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule,
act, or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This
chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law, except
that where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different
from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other
provision of law, the more restrictive provisions or higher standards
shall control.

A. Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality standards in
§ 286-4. To the maximum extent practicable, these standards shall be

meet these standards shall be incorporated into the design.
B. The standards in this chapter apply only to new major development and
are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on water
quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and maintain
groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new major
development to the extent that alternative design and performance
standards are applicable under a regional stormwater management
plan or water quality management plan adopted in accordance with
Department rules.
§ 286-2 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 286-4
1:300

is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance with the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements of Subsections F and G may be obtained for the
enlargement of an existing public roadway or railroad, or the
construction or enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided
that the following conditions are met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates, through an alternatives analysis, that,
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of Subsections F and G to the
maximum extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of Subsections F and G, existing structures currently in use, such
as homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above within

Subsections F and G that were not achievable on site.
§ 286-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 286-4
1:301
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Subsections F
and G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth at Subsection E into the design.
The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures
incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant
contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental, or
safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater
management measures identified in Subsection E(2) below into the
design of a particular project, the applicant shall identify the
strategy considered and provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:
(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss.
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces.
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation.

runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
[1] Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that satisfy Subsection E(3) below;
[2] Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash
and debris from drainage systems;

spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and
[4] When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
(3) Site design features identified under Subsection E(2)(i)[2] above
shall comply with the following standard to control passage of solid
and floatable materials through storm drain inlets. For purposes of
this subsection, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment,

For exemptions to this standard see Subsection E(3)(c) below.
(a) Grates.
[1] Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a
storm drain or surface water body under that grate:
[a] The New Jersey Department of Transportation
(NJDOT) bicycle-safe grate, which is described in
Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible
Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidelines (April 1996); or
[b] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square inches
or is no greater than 0.5 inch across the smallest
dimension.
[2] Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer
bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces
include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways,
parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields,
open channels, and stormwater basin floors.
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches or be no greater than
two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
§ 286-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 286-4
1:303
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in Subsection G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Subsections F and
G shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate County Clerk's
office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 286-7 or found on the Department's website
at http://www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
§ 286-4 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 286-4
1:304
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 286-5, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual preconstruction
groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from pre-construction to post-construction for the
two-year storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with a Department-approved remedial action work
plan or landfill closure plan; and areas with high risks
for spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
§ 286-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 286-4
1:305
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels; and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 286-5, complete one of the
following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, post-construction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
pre-construction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the preconstruction
condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
post-construction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten-, and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the pre-construction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the post-construction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to postconstruction
stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
§ 286-4 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 286-4
1:306
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at § 286-2 shall be submitted to the
appropriate Soil Conservation District for review and approval in
accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this
section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in
stormwater runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the
developed site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater
management measures shall only be required for water quality
control if an additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being
proposed on a development site. The requirement to reduce TSS
does not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated
under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New
Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules,
N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specifically exempt under a
NJPDES permit from this requirement. The water quality design
storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in two hours. Water quality
calculations shall take into account the distribution of rain from the
water quality design storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation
of the volume of runoff may take into account the implementation
of nonstructural and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 286-7 or found on the Department's website
at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources of
technical guidance are listed in § 286-7. TSS reduction shall be
calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2
below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, P.O. Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (A x B)/100
Where:
R = Total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs.
A = TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP.
B = TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second
BMP.
§ 286-4 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 286-4
1:308
Table 2: TSS Removal Rates for BMPs
Best Management Practice TSS Percent Removal Rate
Bioretention systems 90%
Constructed stormwater wetland 90%
Extended detention basin 40% to 60%
Infiltration structure 80%
Manufactured treatment device See § 286-6C
Sand filter 80%
Vegetative filter strip 60% to 80%
Wet pond 50% to 90%
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converges on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Subsections F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 286-7.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
§ 286-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 286-4
1:309
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable. In no case shall the remaining special water
resource protection area be reduced to less than 150 feet
as measured perpendicular to the top of bank of the
waterway or center line of the waterway where the bank is
undefined. All encroachments proposed under this
subsection shall be subject to review and approval by the
Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under
the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et
seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
Standard for Off-Site Stability in the Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under the Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS postconstruction
removal rate;
§ 286-4 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 286-4
1:310
§ 286-5. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this subsection shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to Subsection G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in Subsection G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall
a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
special water resource protection area to less than 150 feet as
measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
§ 286-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 286-5
1:311
National Engineering Handbook Section 4, Hydrology, and
Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds;
or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the pre-construction
condition of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at Subsection A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at Subsection A(1)(b). A runoff
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption
prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover has
existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the
time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the
presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the
land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land
use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and
conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing pre-construction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce pre-construction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the

take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas; wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of § 286-8B.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosionresistant.
Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
5:21-7.4, and 5:21-7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
§ 286-8.

adjoins or faces premises situated in any residential district or
institutional premises by a solid, uniformly painted fence or wall not
less than four feet nor more than six feet in height, maintained in good
condition; provided, however, that where the adjacent owners agree, in
writing, or by Planning Board requirement, a screening hedge or
natural landscaping may be substituted for the required fence or wall.
No part of any parking area shall be closer than 10 feet to any school,
hospital or other institutional building unless properly screened in
accordance with Planning Board requirements. [Amended 4-18-2011
by Ord. No. 658]
E. Parking areas may be located in any yard space but shall not be closer
than 10 feet to any street line.

the buildings for which a community parking program is provided does
not require final grading and surfacing of the entire area, grant
permission for deferment of that portion of the final grading and
surfacing not required by the then-current occupancy and use. No
person shall permit or cause to be occupied any building by more
persons than shall be permitted by Planning Board approval of the
community parking plan. In the event that the Planning Board shall
determine, after notice to the owner of buildings participating in the
community parking plan and a hearing, that the partially paved and
graded parking area is inadequate, the owner shall forthwith complete
the final grading and surfacing of the entire required parking area.

Guarantee Requirements
§ 303-46. On-tract improvements; guarantees required. [Amended
7-9-2018 by Ord. No. 723]
A. The Borough, as a condition of final site plan approval, may require the
developer to furnish and shall accept in accordance with the standards
adopted by this Code and the regulations adopted pursuant to Section 1
of P.L. 1999, c. 68 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53a) a performance guarantee, for
the purpose of assuring the installation and maintenance of certain ontract
improvements, and a maintenance guarantee, both in accordance
with Subsection A(1) and (2) of this section. Successor developers shall
furnish a replacement performance guarantee, as a condition to the
approval of a permit update under the State Uniform Construction
Code, for the purpose of updating the name and address of the owner of
property on a construction permit, and the Borough shall accept the
replacement performance guarantee in accordance with the standards
adopted by this Code and the regulations adopted pursuant to Section 1
of P.L. 1999, c. 68 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53a) for the purpose of assuring the
installation and maintenance of certain on-tract improvements, the
furnishing of a performance guarantee, and provision for a
maintenance guarantee, in accordance with Subsection A(1) and (2) of
this section.
(1) Performance guarantees.
(a) The developer shall furnish a performance guarantee in favor
of the Borough in an amount not to exceed 120% of the cost of
installation of only those improvements required by an
approval or developer's agreement, ordinance, or regulation to
be dedicated to a public entity, and that have not yet been
installed, which cost shall be determined by the Borough
Engineer, according to the method of calculation set forth in
Section 15 of P.L. 1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4), for the
following improvements as shown on the approved plans or
plat: streets; pavement; gutters; curbs; sidewalks; street
lighting; street trees; surveyor's monuments, as shown on the
final map and required by "the Map Filing Law," P.L. 1960, c.
141 (N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.; repealed by section 2 of P.L.
2011, c. 217) or N.J.S.A. 46:26B-1 through 46:26B-8; water
mains; sanitary sewers; community septic systems; drainage
structures; public improvements of open space; and any
grading necessitated by the preceding improvements. The
Borough Engineer shall prepare an itemized cost estimate of
the improvements covered by the performance guarantee,
which itemized cost estimate shall be appended to each
performance guarantee posted by the obligor.
(b) The developer also will furnish a performance guarantee to
include, within an approved phase or section of a development,
§ 303-46 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 303-46
1:401
privately owned perimeter buffer landscaping, as imposed as
a condition of approval. At the developer's option, a separate
performance guarantee may be posted for the privately owned
perimeter buffer landscaping.
(c) If the developer seeks a temporary certificate of occupancy for
a development, unit, lot, building, or phase of development, as
a condition of the issuance thereof, the developer shall furnish
a separate guarantee, referred to herein as a "temporary
certificate of occupancy guarantee," in favor of the Borough in
an amount equal to 120% of the cost of installation of only
those improvements or items which remain to be completed or
installed under the terms of the temporary certificate of
occupancy and which are required to be installed or completed
as a condition precedent to the issuance of the permanent
certificate of occupancy for the development, unit, lot,
building, or phase of development, and which are not covered
by an existing performance guarantee. Upon posting of a
temporary certificate of occupancy guarantee, all sums
remaining under a performance guarantee, required pursuant
to Subsection A(1)(a) of this section, which relate to the
development, unit, lot, building, or phase of development of
which the temporary certificate of occupancy is sought, shall
be released. The scope and amount of the temporary certificate
of occupancy guarantee shall be determined by the Zoning
Officer and Borough Engineer. The Borough will not hold more
than one guarantee or bond of any type with respect to the
same line item. The temporary certificate of occupancy
guarantee shall be released by the Zoning Officer or the
Borough Engineer upon the issuance of a permanent
certificate of occupancy with regard to the development, unit,
lot, building, or phase as to which the temporary certificate of
occupancy relates.
(d) Safety and stabilization guarantee.
[1] A developer shall furnish to the Borough a safety and
stabilization guarantee, in favor of the Borough. At the
developer's option, a safety and stabilization guarantee
may be furnished either as a separate guarantee or as a
line item of the performance guarantee. A safety and
stabilization guarantee shall be available to the Borough
solely for the purpose of returning property that has been
disturbed to a safe and stable condition or otherwise
implementing measures to protect the public from access
to an unsafe or unstable condition, only in the
circumstance that:
[a] Site disturbance has commenced and, thereafter, all
work on the development has ceased for a period of at
least 60 consecutive days following such
§ 303-46 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 303-46
1:402
commencement for reasons other than force majeure;
and
[b] Work has not recommenced within 30 days following
the provision of written notice by the Borough to the
developer of the Borough's intent to claim payment
under the guarantee. The Borough shall not provide
notice of its intent to claim payment under a safety
and stabilization guarantee until a period of at least 60
days has elapsed during which all work on the
development has ceased for reasons other than force
majeure. The Borough shall provide written notice to a
developer by certified mail or other form of delivery
providing evidence of receipt.
[2] Amount.
[a] The amount of a safety and stabilization guarantee for
a development with bonded improvements in an
amount not exceeding $100,000 shall be $5,000.
[b] The amount of a safety and stabilization guarantee for
a development with bonded improvements exceeding
$100,000 shall be calculated as a percentage of the
bonded improvement costs of the development or
phase of development as follows:
[c] $5,000 for the first $100,000 of bonded improvement
costs, plus 2 1/2% of bonded improvement costs in
excess of $100,000, up to $1,000,000; plus
[d] One percent of bonded improvement costs in excess of
$1,000,000.
[3] Release.
[a] The Borough shall release a separate safety and
stabilization guarantee to a developer upon the
developer's furnishing of a performance guarantee
that includes a line item for safety and stabilization in
the amount required under this paragraph.
[b] The Borough shall release a safety and stabilization
guarantee upon the Borough Engineer's
determination that the development of the project site
has reached a point that the improvements installed
are adequate to avoid any potential threat to public
safety.
(2) Maintenance guarantee.
(a) The developer shall post with the Borough, prior to the release
of a performance guarantee required pursuant to Subsection
§ 303-46 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 303-46
1:403
A(1)(a), Subsection A(1)(b), or both Subsection A(1)(a) and (b)
of this section, a maintenance guarantee in an amount not to
exceed 15% of the cost of the installation of the improvements
which are being released.
(b) If required, the developer shall post with the Borough, upon
the inspection and issuance of final approval of the following
private site improvements by the Borough Engineer, a
maintenance guarantee in an amount not to exceed 15% of the
cost of the installation of the following private site
improvements: stormwater management basins, inflow and
water quality structures within the basins, and the outflow
pipes and structures of the stormwater management system, if
any, which cost shall be determined according to the method of
calculation set forth in Section 15 of P.L. 1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53.4).
(c) The term of the maintenance guarantee shall be for a period
not to exceed two years and shall automatically expire at the
end of the established term.
(3) If other governmental agencies or public utilities automatically will
own the utilities to be installed or the improvements are covered by
a performance or maintenance guarantee to another governmental
agency, no performance or maintenance guarantee, as the case
may be, shall be required by the Borough for such utilities or
improvements.
B. The time allowed for installation of the bonded improvements for which
a performance guarantee has been provided may be extended by the
governing body by resolution. As a condition or as part of any such
extension, the amount of any performance guarantee shall be increase
or reduced, as the case may be, to an amount not to exceed 120% of the
cost of the installation, which cost shall be determined by the Borough
Engineer according to the method of calculation set forth in Section 15
of P.L. 1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4) as of the time of the passage
of the resolution.
C. If the required bonded improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guarantee, the obligor and surety, if
any, shall be liable thereon to the Borough for the reasonable cost of the
improvements not completed or corrected and the Borough may either
prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof complete such
improvements. Such completion or correction of improvements shall be
subject to the public bidding requirements of the Local Public Contracts
Law, P.L. 1971, c. 198 (N.J.S.A. 40A:11-1 et seq.).
D. Completion of improvements.
(1) Upon substantial completion of all required street improvements
(except for the top course) and appurtenant utility improvements,
and the connection of same to the public system, the obligor may
§ 303-46 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 303-46
1:404
request of the governing body in writing, by certified mail
addressed in care of the Borough Clerk, that the Borough Engineer
prepare, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by
the Borough Engineer and appended to the performance guarantee
pursuant to Subsection A of this section, a list of all incomplete
or unsatisfactory completed improvements. If such a request is
made, the obligor shall send a copy of the request to the Borough
Engineer. The request shall indicate which improvements have
been completed and which improvements remain incomplete in the
judgment of the obligor. Thereupon the Borough Engineer shall
inspect all bonded improvements covered by obligor's request and
shall file a detailed list and report, in writing, with the governing
body, and shall simultaneously send a copy thereof to the obligor
not later than 45 days after receipt of the obligor's request.
(2) The list prepared by the Borough Engineer shall state, in detail,
with respect to each bonded improvement determined to be
incomplete or unsatisfactory, the nature and extent of the
incompleteness of each incomplete improvement or the nature and
extent of, and remedy for, the unsatisfactory state of each
completed bonded improvement determined to be unsatisfactory.
The report prepared by the Borough Engineer shall identify each
bonded improvement determined to be complete and satisfactory
together with a recommendation as to the amount of reduction to
be made in the performance guarantee relating to the completed
and satisfactory bonded improvement, in accordance with the
itemized cost estimate prepared by the Borough Engineer and
appended to the performance guarantee pursuant to Subsection A
of this section.
E. Approval or rejection of improvements.
(1) The governing body, by resolution, shall either approve the bonded
improvements determined to be complete and satisfactory by the
Borough Engineer, or reject any or all of these bonded
improvements upon the establishment in the resolution of cause for
rejection, and shall approve and authorize the amount of reduction
to be made in the performance guarantee relating to the
improvements accepted, in accordance with the itemized cost
estimate prepared by the Borough Engineer and appended to the
performance guarantee pursuant to Subsection A of this section.
This resolution shall be adopted not later than 45 days after receipt
of the list and report prepared by the Borough Engineer. Upon
adoption of the resolution by the governing body, the obligor shall
be released from all liability pursuant to its performance guarantee
with respect to those approved improvements, except for that
portion adequately sufficient to secure completion or correction of
the improvements not yet approved; provided that 30% of the
amount of the total performance guarantee and safety and
stabilization guarantee posted may be retained to ensure
§ 303-46 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 303-46
1:405
completion and acceptability of all improvements. The safety and
stabilization guarantee shall be reduced by the same percentage
as the performance guarantee is being reduced at the time of each
performance guarantee reduction. For the purpose of releasing
the obligor from liability pursuant to its performance guarantee,
the amount of the performance guarantee attributable to each
approved bonded improvement shall be reduced by the total
amount for each such improvement in accordance with the
itemized cost estimate prepared by the Borough Engineer and
appended to the performance guarantee pursuant to Subsection A
of this section, including any contingency factor applied to the cost
of installation. If the sum of the approved bonded improvements
would exceed 70% of the total amount of the performance
guarantee, then the Borough may retain 30% of the amount of the
total performance guarantee and safety and stabilization guarantee
to ensure completion and acceptability of bonded improvements,
as provided above, except that any amount of the performance
guarantee attributable to bonded improvements for which a
temporary certificate of occupancy guarantee has been posted
shall be released from the performance guarantee even if such
release would reduce the amount held by the Borough below 30%.
(2) If the obligor has made a cash deposit with the Borough as part of
the performance guarantee, then any partial reduction granted in
the performance guarantee pursuant to this subsection shall be
applied to the cash deposit in the same proportion as the original
cash deposit bears to the full amount of the performance
guarantee, provided that if the developer has furnished a safety
and stabilization guarantee the Borough may retain cash equal to
the amount of the remaining safety and stabilization guarantee.
F. If any portion of the required bonded improvements is rejected, the
Borough may require the obligor to complete or correct such
improvements and, upon completion or correction, the same procedure
of notification as set forth in this section shall be followed.
G. Inspection fees.
(1) The obligor shall reimburse the Borough for reasonable inspection
fees paid to the Borough engineer for the foregoing inspection of
improvements, which fees shall not exceed the sum of the amounts
set forth in Subsection G(1)(a) and (b) of this section. The Borough
may require the developer to post the inspection fees in escrow in
an amount:
(a) Not to exceed, except for extraordinary circumstances, the
greater of $500 or 5% of the cost of bonded improvements that
are subject to a performance guarantee under Subsection
A(1)(a), Subsection A(1)(b), or both Subsection A(1)(a) and (b)
of this section; and
§ 303-46 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 303-46
1:406
§ 303-47. through § 303-48. (Reserved)135
(b) Not to exceed 5% of the cost of private site improvements that
are not subject to a performance guarantee under Subsection
A(1)(a) of this section, which cost shall be determined pursuant
to Section 15 of P.L. 1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4).
(2) For those developments for which the inspection fees total less
than $10,000, fees may, at the option of the developer, be paid in
two installments. The initial amount deposited in escrow by a
developer shall be 50% of the inspection fees. When the balance on
deposit drops to 20% of the inspection fees because the amount
deposited by the developer has been reduced by the amount paid to
the Borough Engineer for inspections, the developer shall deposit
the remaining 50% of the inspection fees.
(3) For those developments for which the inspection fees total $10,000
or greater, fees may, at the option of the developer, be paid in four
installments. The initial amount deposited in escrow by a developer
shall be 25% of the inspection fees. When the balance on deposit
drops to 10% of the inspection fees because the amount deposited
by the developer has been reduced by the amount paid to the
Borough Engineer for inspection, the developer shall make
additional deposits of 25% of the inspection fees.
(4) If the Borough determines that the amount in escrow for the
payment of inspection fees, as calculated pursuant to Subsection
G(1)(a) and (b) of this section, is insufficient to cover the cost of
additional required inspections, the Borough may require the
developer to deposit additional funds in escrow, provided that the
Borough delivers to the developer a written inspection escrow
deposit request, signed by the Borough Engineer, which informs
the developer of the need for additional inspections, details the
items or undertakings that require inspection, estimates the time
required for those inspections, and estimates the cost of
performing those inspections.
H. If final approval is by stages or sections of development pursuant to
subsection a of Section 29 of P.L. 1975, c. 291 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-38), the
provisions of this section shall be applied by stage or section.
I. If any of the improvements have been dedicated to the Borough on a
subdivision plat or site plan, the governing body shall be deemed, upon
the release of any performance guarantee required pursuant to
Subsection A of this section, to accept dedication for public use of
streets or roads and any other improvements made thereon according
to site plan and subdivision plats approved by the approving authority,
provided that such improvements have been inspected and have
received final approval by the Borough Engineer.

Off-Tract Improvements
§ 303-49. Procedure for determination and allocation of costs.
In the event that the Planning Board shall determine that off-tract
improvements are required in connection with any subdivision or site plan,
then prior to granting final approval:
A. The Planning Board shall report to the Borough Council:
(1) The location, character and extent of the required off-tract
improvements.
(2) The Borough Engineer's estimate of the total cost of such off-tract
improvements.
(3) The proposed allocation of said total cost determined in accordance
with the standards set forth in § 303-50.
B. In cases where the Planning Board determines that the reasonable and
necessary need for off-tract improvements is necessitated or required
by the subdivision or site plan and where the improvements are wholly
made necessary by the subdivision or site plan and do not confer
material benefits on any land other than the land within the subdivision
or site plan, the Planning Board shall, as a condition of approval,
require the applicant, at its expense, to provide for and construct such
improvements in the manner provided hereinafter and as otherwise
provided by law.
C. The Borough Council shall determine and report to the Planning Board
whether the off-tract improvement will be constructed:
(1) By the Borough as a general improvement or as a local
improvement, or as a combination thereof; or
(2) By the subdivider or site plan applicant with a formula specified by
the Borough Council providing for partial reimbursement if the
improvement specially benefits property other than that within the
subdivision or site plan.
D. The Planning Board shall require, as a condition for approval of the final
plan or site plan, that:
(1) If the improvement is to be constructed by the Borough as a
general improvement, the subdivider or site plan applicant shall
deposit with the Borough Treasurer an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the estimated cost of the improvement
and the estimated total amount by which all properties, including
the subdivision or site plan to be serviced by the improvement, will
be specially benefited by the improvement;
§ 303-49 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 303-49
1:409
§ 303-50. Standards for allocating cost.
(2) If the improvement is to be constructed by the Borough as a local
improvement, the subdivider or site plan applicant shall deposit
with the Borough Treasurer, in addition to the amount specified in
Subsection D(1), the estimated amount by which the subdivision or
site plan will be specially benefited by the improvement; or
(3) If the improvement is to be constructed by the subdivider or site
plan applicant, the subdivider or site plan applicant shall file with
the Borough Clerk a performance guaranty meeting the
requirements of § 303-46 in the full estimated cost of the
improvement.
A. In determining the allocation of costs for off-tract improvements
between the subdivider or site plan applicant, other property owners
and the Borough, the Planning Board shall be guided by the following
factors:
(1) The total estimated cost of the off-tract improvements.
(2) The increase in market values of the properties affected and any
other benefits conferred.
(3) The needs created by the application.
(4) Population and land use projections for the land within the general
area of the subdivision or site plan and other areas to be served by
the off-tract improvements.
(5) The estimated time for construction of the off-tract improvements.
(6) The condition and periods of usefulness of the improvements which
may be based upon the criteria of N.J.S.A. 40A:2-22.
B. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Planning Board
may take into account the following specific factors:
(1) With respect to street, curb, gutter, sidewalk, shade tree,
streetlight, street sign and traffic light improvements, the Board
may consider:
(a) Traffic counts.
(b) Existing and projected traffic patterns.
(c) Quality of roads and sidewalks in the area.
(d) Such other factors as it may deem relevant to the need created
by the subdivision or site plan.
(2) With respect to drainage facilities, the Board may consider:

1:410
§ 303-51. Deposits.
Any moneys received by the Borough Treasurer for off-tract improvements
to be constructed or installed by the Borough pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter shall be deposited in a suitable depository therefor and
shall be used only for the improvements for which they are deposited or
improvements satisfying the same purpose. If construction of improvements
for which the Borough is responsible has not commenced within five years
from the date of deposit, the amount deposited, with any interest thereon,
shall be returned to the subdivider or site plan applicant or his successor in
interest.
§ 303-52. Actual costs; refund.
Upon completion of any improvement constructed by the municipality as a
general or local improvement, the total cost of such improvement shall be
determined by the Borough Treasurer. The difference between the actual
cost as so determined and the estimated cost shall be computed. The
subdivider or site plan applicant or his successor in interest shall make
remittance to the Borough if the actual cost exceeds the estimated cost
or shall receive a refund from the funds deposited with the Borough if
the estimated cost exceeds the actual cost, in an amount which bears the
same relationship to the difference between the actual and estimated costs
as the amount deposited by the subdivider or site plan applicant for his
proportionate share of the estimated cost bears to the total estimated cost.
Any sum payable by the subdivider or site plan applicant or his successor in
(a) The relationship between the area of the subdivision or site
plan and the area of the total drainage basin of which the
subdivision or site plan is a part.
(b) The proposed use of land within the subdivision or site plan
and the amount of land area to be covered by impervious
surfaces on the land within the subdivision or site plan.
(c) The use, condition or status of the remaining land area in the
drainage basin.
(3) With respect to water, gas and electric supply and distribution
facilities, the Board may consider the use requirements of the use
proposed for the subdivision or site plan and the use requirements
of all other properties to be benefited by the improvements.
(4) With respect to sewerage facilities, the Board may consider:
(a) The anticipated volume of effluent from the use proposed for
the subdivision or site plan and the anticipated volume of
effluent from all other properties to be benefited by the
improvements.
(b) The types of effluent anticipated and particular problems
requiring special equipment or added costs.
§ 303-50 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 303-52
1:411
interest may be levied and collected by the Borough in the same manner as
is provided by law for the levy and collection of real estate taxes.
§ 303-53. Successors in interest.
In the absence of an express provision in a deed or deeds of conveyance,
it shall be presumed that the fee owners of all lots in the subdivision or
site plan at the date any deposit or portion thereof is returned or additional
charge is made pursuant to §§ 303-51 and 303-52 are the lawful successors
in interest to the subdivider or site plan applicant and that each such fee
owner shall be charged with or entitled to receive a pro rata share, based
on lot area, of any funds to be returned or additional charge to be made
pursuant to this article. Upon payment of any such sums to the fee owners,
the Borough shall be released from liability to any other person.

A. If, before final subdivision approval has been granted, any person
transfers or sells or agrees to transfer or sell, except pursuant to an
agreement expressly conditioned on final subdivision approval, as
owner or agent, any land which forms a part of a subdivision for which
Borough approval is required by this chapter, such person shall be
subject to a penalty not to exceed $1,000, and each lot disposition so
made may be deemed a separate violation.
B. Any owner, tenant or other occupant, agent, architect, builder,
contractor or any other workman or any other person who shall commit,
take part in or assist in any violation, other than a violation set forth in
Subsection A, or who shall knowingly maintain any building or premises
in which any violation of this chapter shall exist may, upon conviction
thereof, for each and every violation, be fined not exceeding $500 or be
imprisoned in the Bergen County Jail for a period not exceeding 90

(2) The person, contractor, or utility shall provide the traffic officer
with at least two emergency contact telephone numbers to be used
in case of an emergency problem at the construction or

hazardous condition and the contractor shall be responsible for all
costs and expenses of the same.
(3) There shall be no construction, maintenance operation or utility
work on any roadway in the Borough, except in an emergency,

C. The Borough of Harrington Park, County of Bergen, State of New
Jersey, does hereby adopt the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control

General Regulations
§ 350-6. Compliance required; general restrictions.
Except as hereinafter provided:
§ 350-7. Improved lot coverage. [Added 5-21-2001 by Ord. No. 545]
A. No building or land shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building
or part thereof shall be erected, moved or altered unless in conformity
with the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is
located.
B. No building shall hereafter be erected or altered to exceed the height,
to accommodate or house a greater number of families, to occupy a
greater percentage of lot area or to have narrower or smaller rear
yards, front yards, side yards or inner or outer courts than specified
herein for the district in which such building is located.
C. No part of a yard or other open space required about any building for
the purpose of complying with the provisions of this chapter shall be
included as a part of a yard or other open space similarly required for
another building.
A. Legislative statement. The purpose of this section is to establish the
limits of development of all lots within all of the zones within the
Borough. This section is intended to replace and supersede all previous
zoning reference to "impervious coverage" as otherwise previously
defined in the Borough Code. The purposes of improved lot coverage
are:
(1) To manage surface stormwater runoff, so that the quantity and/or
rate of runoff (discharge) from each individual lot does not increase
to the extent that it might adversely affect neighboring properties;
(2) To protect and improve the quality of surface stormwater runoff, so
that the water quality of receiving waters is not impaired;
(3) To improve the visual quality of our residential and nonresidential
neighborhoods by reducing the aerial extent of improvements on
lots and by increasing the expanse of vegetated areas;
(4) To improve the visual quality of our residential and nonresidential
neighborhoods by reducing the bulk of structures on individual
lots; and
(5) To maximize the flow of air and access to sunlight between
buildings by reducing the bulk of man-made improvements on
individual lots.
B. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
§ 350-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-7
1:463
§ 350-8. Change in use. [Added 6-21-2004 by Ord. No. 567]
IMPROVEMENT  Any constructed or man-made object or structure
or any structure made from natural materials but used for a purpose
otherwise provided by man-made objects (e.g., stone driveways).
Typically, this would exclude only landscaped areas.
C. In order to achieve these purposes, the maximum quantity of
improvements on residential and nonresidential lots has been
established as a percentage of the total area of the lot as follows:
(1) R-1 Zone: 45%.
(2) R-2 Zone: 42%.
(3) R-3 Zone: 35%.
(4) B-1 Zone: 80%.
(5) B-2 Zone: 80%.
(6) S-1 Zone: 45%.
(7) I-1 Zone: 80%.
(8) OALSR Zone: 40%. [Amended 7-18-2016 by Ord. No. 705]
A. Any change in use, ownership or occupancy of an existing
nonresidential structure or use shall require approval.
B. Upon change of use, the Construction Code Official shall determine
whether the use is of a nature, extent and intensity so similar to the
previous use that a use permit shall not be required. The Construction
Code Official may either issue a continuing certificate of occupancy or
refer the matter to the Planning Board. In either event, the applicant for
a certificate of occupancy shall pay the fee established for use permits.
C. The applicant shall be required to submit a change of use application
and an accompanying sketch plat indicating the location and layout of
all existing structures, lot configuration, general parking and loading
areas, lighting, drainage, landscaping and other general site factors. In
lieu of such sketch plat, the applicant may refer to prior site plans for
the premises filed with the approving authority, with appropriate
notations indicating any changes made on the premises since the
earlier site plan approval.
D. If the Construction Code Official determines that the change of the
nature of the use, extent or intensity of activity does not require
additional improvements, the Construction Code Official shall approve
the application or conditionally approve the application.
E. If the Construction Code Official determines that certain improvements
are required or the nature, extent of use or intensity should be
reviewed, he shall deny the application and require submission to the
§ 350-7 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 350-8

Planning Board of the use permit and partial or complete site plan
application as provided by this chapter.

A. Statement of purpose. This section is intended to help preserve the
general residential character of the community, to enhance the
aesthetic appearance of the business district so as to blend with the
overall character of the community, and to facilitate the safe and
orderly flow of traffic throughout the community. In order to achieve
these goals, the municipal agency administering these regulations shall
ensure that permitted signs are compatible with their immediate
surroundings and with the zone in which the signs are located and shall
ensure that permitted signs are appropriate to the specific type of
activity to which they pertain.
B. General provisions. The following provisions shall be applicable in all
districts of the community:
(1) No sign shall be erected, altered, relocated, maintained or
reconstructed unless it shall conform to these regulations. Plans for
each sign shall be reviewed and approved by the Zoning Officer
prior to the issuance of a permit for such sign. The following signs
shall be exempt from the requirements of Zoning Officer review
and permits:
(a) Signs not exceeding one square foot in area and bearing only
property numbers, post box numbers, names of the occupants
or other identification of noncommercial premises.

ARTICLE XI
Soil Removal
[Added 5-16-1988 by Ord. No. 399]
§ 350-54. Purpose and findings.
The purpose of this article shall be to prevent the unregulated and
uncontrolled relocation, filling, excavation and removal of soil by any person
which may result in conditions detrimental to the public safety, health
and general welfare, substantially hampering and deterring the efforts
of the Borough to effectuate the general purpose of municipal planning.
The continuation of the unregulated and uncontrolled relocation, filling,
excavation and removal of soil and filling with unsuitable material may
cause serious and irreparable damage to the public welfare by reason
of: consequent soil erosion by water and wind; inadequate and improper
surface water drainage; decrease in or destruction of the fertility of soil;
removal of lateral support of abutting streets, lands and premises; creation
of dust storms and mosquito breeding places; creation of dangerous
depressions or pits; deterioration of property values; rendering of lands
unfit or unsuitable to their most appropriate uses; and creation of other
factors and elements hampering and deterring the coordinated, adjusted
and harmonious physical development of the Borough.
§ 350-55. Definitions.
As used in the article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
LOT  Any parcel of land or portion thereof, the boundary lines of which
can be ascertained by reference to the maps and records, or either, in the
office of the Tax Assessor of the Borough or in the office of the Bergen
County Clerk. For the purposes of this article, a lot shall also be deemed
to be any contiguous parcels of land under common ownership, which
ownership can be ascertained by reference to the maps and records, or
either, in the office of the Tax Assessor of the Borough or in the office of the
Bergen County Clerk.
MAJOR SOIL MOVING PERMIT  Any soil permit other than a minor soil
moving permit as herein defined.
MINOR SOIL MOVING PERMIT  A permit for the movement of soil
between 35 cubic yards and 350 cubic yards. Further, on application to the
Borough Clerk, on certification of the applicant, a waiver shall be issued
for the movement of any amount of soil less than 35 cubic yards; provided,
however, that, in the event topsoil is being brought to the site, such soil
is clean and being furnished by an individual or company that regularly
deals in the provision of topsoil; further provided that in the event that
less than 35 cubic yards will be disturbed in the building or demolition
of any structure, and that either the Borough Engineer or Construction
Code Official determines such disturbance shall not create drainage or
grade deterioration, then either professional may waive such permit

and is composed of 2% or more, by weight, of organic matter and has the
ability to support vegetation.
UNSUITABLE FILL  The Borough Engineer shall determine whether the
fill is suitable or unsuitable to the particular location. The unsuitable
materials are materials such as peat moss, organic material vegetation,
leaves, tree stumps, wood chips, sawdust, chemical waste, tires, wooden
logs, etc.
§ 350-56. Permit required. [Amended 5-21-2001 by Ord. No. 544]

§ 350-68. Plan application procedure.
The procedure for applying for and issuance of an approved tree plan shall
be as follows:
C. Tree plan approval; guaranties.
(1) No building permit with respect to relevant land shall be issued for
site clearing, grubbing or the construction of any residential,
commercial, industrial, recreational, or community buildings or
accessory buildings unless the property owner or its designated
agent first obtains an approved tree plan.
(2) No permit shall be issued unless the applicant has filed with the
Borough a performance guaranty sufficient in amount to equal the
total cost to the Borough, as estimated by the Borough Engineer, of
complying with the conditions of the approved tree plan, in the
event that the applicant does not complete the work as approved.
The form, sufficiency and execution of the performance guaranty
shall be approved by the Borough Attorney. Posting of the guaranty
shall be detailed and defined in any developer's agreement entered
into by the Planning Board, the Borough and an applicant.
(3) A maintenance guaranty shall be furnished by the applicant upon
the release of the performance guaranty and/or the approval of the
Borough Engineer evidencing that all work has been completed in
accordance with the approved tree plan. The maintenance
guaranty shall begin with the release of the performance guaranty
and shall run for a period of two years pursuant to the Municipal
Land Use Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. Provisions governing the
maintenance guaranty shall be contained in the developer's
agreement.

E. Trees in the area between the street line and the setback line of the
buildings shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible.
F. Tree removal from any slope or environmentally sensitive area is
prohibited if it will contribute, in the opinion of the Planning Board, to
extra runoff of surface water onto adjoining property and erosion and
silting, unless other means approved by the Bergen County Soil
Conservation District are provided to prevent runoff and erosion.
G. In the event that the replacement of the required number of trees
cannot reasonably be achieved on site, the applicant may request or
may be required by the Planning Board to contribute an amount equal
to the cost of the replacement tree (including supply, delivery,
installation and guarantee) to a fund established by the Borough for the
purpose of tree maintenance, tree preservation, tree planting, and
landscaping, and including the donation of trees to be planted within
the Borough. Said amount referenced above shall be calculated by
multiplying the current wholesale value of each unplanted tree by
three. Wholesale value shall be determined by the applicant's
submission of a current wholesale catalog (or dated copy thereof) from
a regional nursery listing its price for pickup at the nursery. Failing
such a submission by the applicant, the Planning Board may obtain such
information on its own from any local wholesale nursery. [Added

recommendation of the Harrington Park Environmental Commission,
which recommendation shall not be binding upon the Council, may
review, evaluate, consider and approve requests for the withdrawal of
monies from the fund for projects within the Borough for the planting of
trees, ornamentals and other such beautification initiatives.
B. Upon approval of any such request for fund withdrawal, the Borough's
Chief Financial Officer shall arrange for the payment of such project
pursuant to the terms and conditions of such approval and subject to
such other conditions as the Chief Financial Officer may impose for the
release of such funds, including but not limited to vouchers.
A. Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to control and regulate the
indiscriminate or excessive removal, large-scale clear-cutting and
destruction of trees associated with new construction on single-family
lots and to control and regulate and prevent conditions which cause an
increase in stormwater runoff, sedimentation, soil erosion, or air or
noise pollution or inhibit aquifer recharge or impair the ambiance or

ARTICLE XIII
Wireless Telecommunications Towers
[Added 12-21-1998 by Ord. No. 515]
§ 350-74. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish general guidelines for the siting
of wireless communications towers and antennas. The goals of this article
are to: (1) protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers and antennas; (2) encourage the location of towers in
nonresidential areas; (3) minimize the total number of towers throughout
the community; (4) strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing
tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional
single-use towers; (5) encourage users of towers and antennas to locate
them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal; (6) encourage users of towers and antennas to
configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the
towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape, screening,
and innovative camouflaging techniques; (7) consider the public health and
safety of communication towers; and (8) avoid potential damage to adjacent
properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of
tower structures. In furtherance of these goals, the Borough of Harrington
Park shall give due consideration to the communities adjacent to it, their
zoning maps and master plans, existing land uses, and environmentally
sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of towers and antennas.
§ 350-75. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth
below:
ALTERNATIVE TOWER STRUCTURE  Man-made trees, clock towers, bell
steeples, light poles and similar alternative design mounting structures that
camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers.
ANTENNA  Any exterior transmitting or receiving device mounted on
a tower, building or structure and used in communications that radiate
or capture electromagnetic waves, digital signals, analog signals, radio
frequencies (excluding radar signals), wireless telecommunications signals
or other communication signals.
BACKHAUL NETWORK  The lines that connect a provider's towers/cell
sites to one or more cellular telephone switching offices and/or longdistance
providers or the public switching telephone network.
FAA  The Federal Aviation Administration.
FCC  The Federal Communications Commission.
HEIGHT  When referring to a tower or other structure, the distance
measured from the average natural grade as defined elsewhere in the
Borough Code to the highest point on the tower or other structure,
§ 350-74 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-75
1:553
including the base pad and any antenna.[Added 4-18-2011 by Ord. No.
658]
PREEXISTING TOWERS and PREEXISTING ANTENNAS  Any tower or
antenna for which a building permit or conditional use permit has been
properly issued prior to the effective date of this article, including permitted
towers or antennas that have not yet been constructed, so long as such
approval is current and not expired.
TOWER  Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for
the purpose of supporting one or more antennas for telephone, radio and
similar communication purposes, including self-supporting lattice towers,
guyed towers, or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television
transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular
telephone towers, alternative tower structures, and the like. The term
includes the structure and any support thereto.
§ 350-76. Applicability.
§ 350-77. General requirements.
A. New towers and antennas. All new towers or antennas in the Borough
shall be subject to these regulations, except as provided in Subsections
B, C and D, inclusive.
B. Amateur radio station operator/receive-only antennas. This article shall
not govern the installation of any antenna owned and operated by an
amateur radio operator or which is used exclusively for receive-only
antennas and for private noncommercial purposes, which shall be
regulated elsewhere in the Code of the Borough.
C. Preexisting towers or antennas. Preexisting towers and preexisting
antennas shall not be required to meet the requirements of this article,
other than the requirements of § 350-77F and G, absent any
enlargement or structural modification or the addition of any
structures.
D. AM array. For purposes of implementing this article, an AM array,
consisting of one or more tower units and supporting ground system
which function as one AM broadcasting antenna, shall be considered
one tower. Measurements for setbacks and separation distances shall
be measured from the outer perimeter of the towers included in the AM
array. Additional tower units may be added within the perimeter of the
AM array by right.
A. Principal or conditional use. Antennas and towers may be considered
either principal or conditional uses. A different existing use of any
existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of
an antenna or tower on such lot. However, all such preexisting uses
must be approved authorized uses.
§ 350-75 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 350-77
1:554
B. Lot size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a
tower or antenna complies with zone development regulations,
including but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage
requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the
entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be
located on leased parcels within such lot.
C. Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower
shall provide to the Zoning Officer an inventory of all existing towers,
antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas that are either
within the jurisdiction of the Borough or within one mile of the border
thereof, including specific information about the ownership, location,
height, and design of each tower. The Zoning Officer may share such
information with other applicants applying for approvals under this
article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the
jurisdiction of the Borough; provided, however that the Zoning Officer
is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or
warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
D. Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following requirements:
(1) Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to
any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so
as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2) At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures
shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures,
screening, and landscaping that will blend them into the natural
setting and surrounding buildings.
(3) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must
be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with,
the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and
related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
E. Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the
FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting
alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views.
F. State and federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of
the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers
and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the
owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring
such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards
and regulations within six months of the effective date of such
standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is
mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring
towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
§ 350-77 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-77
1:555
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or
antenna at the owner's expense.
G. Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity
of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local
building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are
published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from
time to time. If, upon inspection, the Borough concludes that a tower
fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger
to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of
the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into
compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into
compliance within said 30 days shall constitute grounds for the removal
of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense.
H. Measurement. For purposes of measurement, tower setbacks and
separation distances shall be calculated and applied to facilities located
in the Borough irrespective of municipal and county jurisdictional
boundaries.
I. Nonessential services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this article and shall not be regulated or
permitted as essential services, public utilities, or private utilities.
J. Franchises. Franchise owners and/or operators of towers or antennas
shall certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/
or operation of a wireless communication system in the Borough have
been obtained and shall file a copy of all required franchises with the
Zoning Officer.
K. Public notice. For purposes of this article, any conditional use request,
variance request, or appeal of an administratively approved use or
conditional use shall require public notice to all abutting property
owners and all property owners of properties that are located within the
corresponding separation distance listed in other sections of this
article.
L. Signs. No signs shall be allowed on an antenna or tower, except for
safety signs.
M. Buildings and support equipment. Buildings and support equipment
associated with antennas or towers shall comply with the requirements
of § 350-81.
N. Multiple antenna/tower plan. The Borough encourages the users of
towers and antennas to submit a single application for approval of
multiple towers and/or antenna sites. Applications for approval of
multiple sites shall be given priority in the review process.
O. Height. No monopole or tower as provided by this article shall exceed a
maximum height of 125 feet. [Added 3-19-2001 by Ord. No. 538]

§ 350-79. Conditional uses.
A. General. The uses listed in this section are deemed to be permitted uses
and shall not require administrative approval or a conditional use
permit.
B. Permitted uses. The following uses are specifically permitted: antennas
or towers located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by
the Borough, provided that a license or lease authorizing such antenna
or tower has been approved by the Borough. Such use shall, however,
require site plan approval. All other uses are prohibited, subject to
§ 350-79 below.
A. General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of
conditional approval for antennas:
(1) The Planning Board may grant conditional use approvals for
antennas to be located within the Borough in all Industrial Districts
and Office and Research Districts south of Old Hook Road.
(2) Each applicant for conditional use approval shall apply to the
Planning Board providing the information set forth in § 350-80 of
this article and a nonrefundable fee as established by ordinance.
(3) The Planning Board shall review the application and determine if
the proposed conditional use complies with this article. It may
review any application for variances (other than those specifically
reserved to the Zoning Board of Adjustment) in conjunction
therewith.
(4) If the conditional use permit is denied, the applicant may file an
application for a variance with the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
B. List of conditional uses. The following uses may be approved by the
Planning Board after conducting an administrative review:
(1) Locating antennas on existing structures or towers consistent with
the terms of Subsections B(1)(a) and (b) below.
(a) Antennas on existing structures. Any antenna which is not
attached to a tower may be approved by the Planning Board as
a conditional use to any commercial, industrial, professional or
institutional use in any such designated zones, provided that:
[1] The antenna does not extend more than the maximum
building height for the zone wherein the structure is
located, and under the Borough's current height
ordinance;

[3] The antenna complies with all applicable building codes.
(b) Antennas on existing towers. An antenna which is attached to
an existing tower may be approved by the Planning Board and,
to minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the
proliferation and clustering of towers, co-location of antennas
by more than one carrier on existing towers shall take
precedence over the construction of new towers, provided that
such co-location is accomplished in a manner consistent with
the following:
[1] A tower which is modified or reconstructed to
accommodate the co-location of an additional antenna
shall be of the same tower type as the existing tower.
[2] Height.
[a] An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller
height, not to exceed the maximum tower height
established by this article.
[b] The height change referred to in Subsection

communication tower.
[c] The additional height referred to in Subsection
B(1)(b)[2][a] shall not require an additional distance
separation as set forth in § 350-80. The tower's premodification
height shall be used to calculate such
distance separations.
[3] On-site location.
[a] A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the colocation
of an additional antenna may be moved on
site within 50 feet of its existing location.
[b] After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate co-location,
only one tower may remain on the site.
[c] A relocated on-site tower shall continue to be
measured from the original tower location for
purposes of calculating separation distances between
towers pursuant to § 350-80E.
A. Information required. In addition to any information required for
applications for conditional use permits, applicants for a site plan
approval for a tower or antenna shall submit the following information:
(1) A scaled site plan clearly indicating the location, type and height of
the proposed tower or antenna, on-site land uses and zoning,

the inventory of existing sites submitted pursuant to § 350-77C
shall be shown on an updated site plan or map. The applicant shall
also identify the type of construction of the existing tower(s) and
the owner/operator of the existing tower(s) and antenna, if known.
(5) A landscape plan showing specific landscape material.
(6) Method of fencing and finished color and, if applicable, the method
of camouflage and illumination.
(7) A description of compliance with § 350-77C, D, E, F, G, J, L and M,
Subsections D and E of this section and all applicable federal, state
or local laws.
(8) Towers only: a notarized statement by the applicant as to whether
construction of a tower will accommodate co-location of additional
antennas for future users.
(9) Identification of the entities providing the backhaul network for the
tower(s) described in the application and other cellular sites owned
or operated by the applicant in the municipality.
(10) A description of the suitability of the use of existing, other

antennas within the Borough based upon existing physical,
engineering, technological or geographical limitations in the event
the proposed tower is erected.
(12) A visual study depicting where, within a three-mile radius, any
portion of the proposed tower could be seen. If the application
concerns an antenna on an existing structure, sight measurements
to the point closest to the structure wherein a person standing at
§ 350-80 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-80
1:559
grade could first observe the antenna shall be provided for all four
building elevations.
(13) A statement of intent on whether excess space will be leased and
how much of the structure's basement or common internal area has
been made available for the storage of equipment accessory to the
antenna.
B. Factors considered in granting site plan approval for towers. In addition
to any standards for consideration of site plan applications pursuant to
the zoning ordinances, the Planning Board shall consider the following
factors in determining whether to issue a site plan approval, although
the Planning Board may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of
one or more of these criteria if the Planning Board concludes the goals
of this article are better served thereby:
(1) Height of the proposed tower and antenna;
(2) Proximity of the tower/antenna to residential structures and
residential district boundaries;
(3) Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
(4) Surrounding topography;
(5) Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
(6) Design of the tower or antenna, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating
visual obtrusiveness;
(7) Proposed ingress and egress; and
(8) Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or
structures as discussed in Subsection C of this section.
C. Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative
technology. No new tower or antenna shall be permitted unless the
applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Planning
Board or Zoning Board that no existing tower, structure or alternative
technology that does not require the use of towers or structures can
accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. An applicant shall
submit information requested by the Board related to the availability of
suitable existing towers, other structures or technology. Evidence
submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower, structure or
alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed
antenna may consist of any of the following (although nothing should be
construed to infer that meeting one, some or all of the following shall
entitle the applicant to approval):
(1) No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic
area which meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
§ 350-80 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 350-80
1:560
(2) Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet
the applicant's engineering requirements.
(3) Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related
equipment.
(4) The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures,
or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause
interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
(5) The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing
tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding
new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable.
(6) The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
(7) The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable
microcell network using multiple low-powered transmitter/
receivers attached to a wireless system, is unsuitable.
**NOTE: The requirements for each applicant to prove and satisfy
the above conditions shall be an express element of its conditional
use application and shall be required of all applicants, regardless
of whether a use variance is required under N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d.
D. Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all towers
for which a conditional use permit is required; provided, however, that
the Planning Board may reduce the standard setback requirements if
the goals of this article would be better served thereby:
(1) Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least 75% of the
height of the tower from any adjoining lot line.
(2) Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning
district setback requirements.
(3) No tower shall exist within required buffer areas, if adjacent to
residential zones and as prescribed under local ordinance.
E. Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply to all
towers and antennas for which a conditional use permit is required;
provided, however, that the Planning Board may reduce the standard
separation requirements if the goals of this article would be better
served thereby:
(1) Separation from off-site uses or designated areas.
§ 350-80 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-80

outside the perimeter of the compound.
(2) In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal,
the landscaping requirement may be reduced.
(3) Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases,
such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around
the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer.
A. Antennas mounted on structures or rooftops. The equipment cabinet or
structure used in connection with antennas shall comply with the
following:
(1) The cabinet or structure shall not contain more than 100 square
feet of gross floor area or be more than 10 feet in height. In

§ 350-82. Removal of abandoned antennas and towers.
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12
months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or
tower shall remove the same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the
Borough notifying the owner of such abandonment. Failure to remove an
abandoned antenna or tower within said 90 days shall be grounds to remove
the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users
(2) If the equipment structure is located on the roof of a building, the
area of the equipment and structures shall not occupy more than
10% of the roof area.
(3) Equipment storage buildings or cabinets shall comply with all
applicable building codes.
B. Antennas mounted on utility pole, light pole or tower. The equipment

greater than six feet in height or 100 square feet of gross floor area
and the cabinet/structure is located a minimum of 75 feet from all
lot lines. The cabinet/structure shall be screened by an evergreen
hedge with an ultimate height of at least 42 inches to 48 inches and
a planted height of at least 36 inches.
(2) In a rear yard, provided that the cabinet or structure is no greater
than eight feet in height or 120 square feet in gross floor area. The
cabinet/structure shall be screened by an evergreen hedge with an
ultimate height of eight feet and a planted height of at least 48
inches.
(3) In all other instances, structures or cabinets shall be screened from
view of all residential properties which abut or are directly across
the street from the structure or cabinet by a solid fence six feet in
height or an evergreen hedge with an ultimate height of eight feet
and a planted height of at least 72 inches.

of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all
users cease using the tower. The Borough may condition the issuance of
any permit to construct, demolish or remove a tower or antenna on the
posting of an appropriate performance bond or other suitable guarantee
in a face amount of not less than 120% of the cost (as determined by the
Planning Board Engineer) of such removal, grading and restoration to a
state required under all applicable Borough ordinances, including but not
limited to Chapter 248, Property Maintenance.

the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
D. Destruction. No building damaged by fire or other causes to the extent
of more than 50% of its actual value shall be repaired or rebuilt except
in conformity with the regulations of this chapter.
E. Abandonment. Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued
for a period of one year, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished,
and any future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter.
F. Changes. Once changed to a conforming use, no building or land shall
be permitted to revert to a nonconforming use.
G. Displacement. No nonconforming use shall be extended to displace a
conforming use.
H. District changes. Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be
changed so as to transfer an area from one district to another district of
a different classification, the foregoing provisions shall also apply to any
nonconforming uses existing therein.
I. Restoration. Any nonconforming building damaged by fire or other
causes to the extent of less than 50% of its actual value may be

enlargement and occupancy of all uses which are in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter and all nonconforming uses existing at the
time of passage of this chapter. The Zoning Officer or his designee shall
also record and file all applications for permits with accompanying plans
and documents and make such reports to the Zoning Board of Adjustment,
Planning Board and governing body as may be required. Building permits
for a variance from the requirements of this chapter shall be issued only
upon written order of the Zoning Board of Adjustment or the governing
body, as the case may be.
§ 350-87. Building permits.
A. Purpose. To ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter, no
person shall erect, alter or convert any structure or building or part
thereof nor alter the use of any land subsequent to the adoption of this
chapter until a building permit has been issued by the Zoning Officer or
his designee.
B. Application for permits. All such applications shall be made in a manner
prescribed in the Building Code of the Borough of Harrington Park and
shall be accompanied by plans in triplicate, drawn to scale, showing the
location, shape and dimensions of the lot, the location of and existing
and intended use of each building or part thereof, the height thereof,
the number of dwelling units and square feet of space, the amount and
location of off-street parking and loading and other data as may be
required by ordinance. The applicant shall also give such other

any kind unless a building permit covering such operation has been
displayed as required by this chapter, nor shall he perform building
operations of any kind after notification of the revocation of said
building permit.
D. Denial of permits. When the Zoning Officer or his designee is not
satisfied that the applicant's proposed development will meet the
requirements of this chapter, he shall state on the application the
reason for denial and shall refuse to issue a building permit, and the
applicant may appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment for a reversal
of the Zoning Officer's decision.
E. Revocation of permits. If it shall appear at any time to the Zoning
Officer or his designee that the application or accompanying plan is in
any respect false or misleading or that work is being done upon the
premises differing from that called for in the applications filed with him
under existing laws or ordinances, he may forthwith revoke the building
permit, whereupon it shall be the duty of the person holding the same to
surrender it and all copies thereof to said Zoning Officer. After the
building permit has been revoked, the Zoning Officer may, in his
discretion, before issuing the new building permit, require the
applicant to file an indemnity bond in favor of the Borough of
Harrington Park with sufficient surety conditioned for compliance with
this chapter and all laws and ordinances then in force and in a sum
sufficient to cover the cost of removing the building or structure if it
does not so comply.
A. For new uses.
(1) Compliance with this chapter. It shall be unlawful to use or permit
the use of any building or part thereof hereafter created, erected,
changed, converted, altered or enlarged, wholly or in part, until a

§ 350-98. Violations and penalties.
Borough of Harrington Park which are used or occupied or intended
to be used or occupied in violation of the Zoning Ordinance of the

§ 350-96 HARRINGTON PARK CODE § 350-98
1:576
§ 350-99. Costs of moving to be borne by violator.
§ 350-100. Findings and declarations.
The Mayor and Council hereby find and declare that there has been a
proliferation of what are commonly known as "illegal apartments," meaning
provisions of N.J.S.A. 2A:18-61.1g(c). Notwithstanding the penalties
provided above, a second or subsequent violation for an illegal
occupancy as provided in this subsection by any owner-landlord for
a second or subsequent violation, the Municipal Court may impose a
fine equal to the annual tuition costs of any resident of the illegally
occupied unit attending a public school, which fine shall be recovered in
a civil action by a summary proceeding in the name of the municipality
pursuant to Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999 (N.J.S.A. 2A:58-10 et
seq.). The Municipal Court and the Superior Court shall have
jurisdiction of the proceedings for the enforcement of the penalty
provided by this section. The tuition costs shall be determined in the
manner prescribed for nonresident pupils pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:38-19, and the payment of the fines shall be remitted to the
appropriate school district.
C. In those instances where a violation of this section is based on the
maintenance of residential dwelling units above the number of units
permitted by the Zoning Ordinance on a particular parcel of land (e.g.,
the maintenance of a structure with two residential dwelling units in a
zoning district where single-family homes are permitted), the defendant
who is the owner of a property shall be required to permanently remove
the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, point of entrance/egress or any other
offending illegal structure, appliance or fixture. The Borough
Construction Official or his designee shall inspect the premises to
insure that said removal is accomplished within 30 days of the date of
the entry of the judgment of conviction by the Municipal Court.
A. Any tenant who receives a notice of eviction pursuant to the provisions
of N.J.S.A. 2A:18-61.2 that results from zoning or code enforcement
activity for an illegal occupancy shall be considered a displaced person
and shall be entitled to relocation assistance in an amount equal to six
times the monthly rental paid by the displaced person. The ownerlandlord
of the structure shall be liable for the payment of relocation
assistance pursuant to this section.
B. The Borough of Harrington Park may pay relocation assistance to any
displaced person who has not received the required payment from the
owner-landlord of the structure at the time of eviction pursuant to
Subsection A. All relocation assistance costs incurred by a municipality
pursuant to this subsection shall be repaid by the owner-landlord of the
structure to the municipality in the same manner as relocation costs are
billed and collected under the provisions of N.J.S.A. 20:4-4.1 and
N.J.S.A. 20:4-4.2.
§ 350-98 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 350-100
1:577
residential dwelling units which are occupied in violation of zoning laws.
These illegal apartments manifest themselves as a second residential unit in
a building in a one-family zone. The Mayor and Council hereby further find
and declare that such illegal units have a deleterious effect on the quality
of life of Borough residents, require the provision of Borough services,
generate young people who attend Borough schools, increase the utilization
of Borough programs and services, contribute to the costs of the Borough
by increasing the generation of refuse (garbage) and sewer flow, contribute
to overcrowding, generate traffic within the Borough, generate automobiles
which contribute to parking shortages throughout the Borough and lead to
the maintenance of dwelling units which often fail to meet health, safety
and building code standards. By their nature, such units generally escape
taxation as their maintenance and existence is normally hidden and not
used for tax assessment purposes. The use and maintenance of said illegal
apartments is also unfair to the vast majority of Borough residents who
abide by zoning laws.
§ 350-101. Restitution to Borough.
The Borough determines that the harm and detriment to the Borough
caused by illegal occupancies to be an unfair and inequitable situation.
Difficult to measure, the Borough hereby determines that the most
reasonable way to calculate same is as a percentage of the rental payment
charged by the owner to the occupant on account of the illegal occupancy.
The Borough determines a percentage of 10% of the rent to be fair and
reasonable as a measure of the damage and detriment caused to the
Borough, and the Mayor and Council may authorize the Borough Attorney
to recover from any person who charges, demands, receives or accepts rent
or payment for such an illegal occupancy to make restitution to the Borough
for the damage and detriment caused to the Borough during a period of
illegal occupancy.

authority as those contained in the initial consent. In the event such
subsequent consent does not contain the same terms and conditions as
the instant consent, the Borough agrees to support the company's
petition to the Board for modification of the consent in accordance with
N.J.S.A. 48:5A-47 and N.J.A.C. 14:17-6.7 to relieve the company of
competitive disadvantages identified in the company's petition.195

§ A410-20. Public, educational and governmental access.
A. Cablevision shall continue to make available noncommercial public,
educational and governmental (PEG) access services available to the
residents of the Borough as described in the application for municipal
consent. All Cablevision support of PEG access shall be for the exclusive
benefit of Cablevision's subscribers.
B. The Borough agrees that Cablevision shall retain the right to use the
PEG access channel, or portion thereof, for non-PEG access
programming, during times when the Borough is not utilizing the
channel for purposes of providing PEG access programming. In the
event that the company uses said PEG access channel for the
presentation of such other programming, the PEG programming shall
remain the priority use and the company's rights with respect to using
the channel for non-PEG programming shall be subordinate to the
Borough's provision of PEG access programming on such channel.

shall provide the Borough with a grant in the amount of $5,000.
Cablevision shall provide an initial grant payment of $500 within 90
days of the issuance of the certificate of approval by the Board of Public
Utilities. The remaining grant of $4,500 shall be provided in annual
installments of $500, upon written request by the Borough (the "annual
grant"). The annual grant may be used by the Borough for any cable
and/or other telecommunications-related purpose as the Borough, in its
discretion, might deem appropriate. Cablevision shall not be obligated
to make any additional payments beyond year 10 of the franchise. The
annual grant shall be payable to the Borough within 60 days from
receipt of the Borough's written request. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, should Cablevision apply for a system-wide certification or
otherwise convert its municipal consent to a system-wide certification
in accordance with N.J.S.A. 48:5A-25.1, it shall be relieved of any
payments due and owing after the date of such conversion or award of a
system-wide franchise. The Borough agrees that all amounts provided
pursuant to Subsection D shall be used for the exclusive support of PEG
access programming, such as the purchase and/or rental of PEG access
equipment and facilities. On request, the Borough shall provide
Cablevision with a certification of compliance with this Subsection D.

that they conflict with state or federal law.
§ A410-22. Consistency with applicable laws.
This consent shall be construed in a manner consistent with all applicable
federal, state and local laws.
§ A410-23. Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this
ordinance is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of
competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct
and independent provision, and such holding shall not affect the validity of
the remaining portion thereof.

issued by the Board of Public Utilities.
