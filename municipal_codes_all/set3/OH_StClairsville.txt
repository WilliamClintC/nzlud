   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of St. Clairsville has had the matter of
codification and general revision of its ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, Council has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.
Drane Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE VILLAGE OF ST.
CLAIRSVILLE, COUNTY OF BELMONT, STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1.  That the ordinances of the Village of St. Clairsville, Ohio, of a

into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved,
adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the Village of St.

   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the Village of St.
Clairsville, Ohio.
Section 2.    That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 4 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to October 20, 1975, which are inconsistent with any provision of
the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

summary of new matter contained in the Codified Ordinances. Any section of the
1975 Codified Ordinances without a legislative history at the end thereof
indicates that such section contains new matter ordained by this Adopting
Ordinance.
Section 4.    That this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety, and for
the further reason that there exists an imperative necessity for the earliest
publication and distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and
residents of the Village, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation
and avoid practical and legal entanglements. Wherefore, this ordinance shall
take effect from and after its passage.
PASSED this 1st day of December, 1975.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

said ordinance or resolution within the thirty (30) days, the Council shall
submit it to a vote of the registered electors at the next general or regular
City election occurring more than ninety (90) days after the filing of such
petition, but if such petition is signed by at least twenty percent (20%) of
such registered electors, the date of the election shall be fixed therein,
which may be a special election to be held at any time more than ninety (90)
days after the filing of such petition.
   Ordinances providing for emergency measures, the annual tax levy,
improvement petitioned for by the owners of a majority of the feet front of the

ordinances limited to the subject of appropriations, shall be not subject to
referendum; but all other ordinances shall be subject to referendum.

elected official of the City. A petition demanding an elected official's recall
and removal may be filed with the Clerk of Council after said official has
served at least six (6) months of his term or after six (6) months subsequent
to any previous recall. Such petitions shall be limited to one elected official
per petition and shall be signed by at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the
registered electors. However, if a recall petition shall be sought against a
councilman elected from any one ward, the petition shall be signed by twenty-
five percent (25%) of the registered electors of such ward.
   Within ten (10) days from the date of filing such petition, the Clerk shall
determine the sufficiency thereof. If the Clerk shall find the petition
insufficient, he shall promptly certify the particulars in which the petition
is defective and deliver a copy of his certificate to that person who filed the
petition with him; and such person shall be allowed twenty (20) days from the
delivery of such copy of certificate in which to make the petition sufficient.
If the Clerk shall find the petition sufficient, he shall promptly so certify
to the Council and to the official whose removal is sought; and if the official
does not resign within five (5) days thereafter, the Council shall thereupon
order and fix a day for holding a recall election not less than thirty (30) nor
more than forty (40) days from the date of the Clerk's certificate of
sufficiency.
   A vacancy caused by recall measure shall be filled by a qualified person for
the unexpired term by a majority vote of the full membership of City Council.
If the vacancy is not filled within thirty (30) days, the Mayor shall fill it
by appointment. The qualifications of a person appointed to fill a vacancy
shall be the same as the qualifications required for an election to the full
term of the office except that the required period of residency shall be
fulfilled as of the date of appointment.

public street or ground. All such grants, amendments or renewals shall be made
subject to the continuing right of the Council to provide reasonable
regulations for the operation of such utilities with reference to such streets

on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be

   (f)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law
which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when
the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

109.01  INTRODUCTION.
   It is the policy of the City of St. Clairsville that openness leads to a
better informed citizenry, which leads to better government and better public
policy.  It is the policy of the City of St. Clairsville to strictly adhere to
the state’s Public Records Act.  All exemptions to openness are to be construed
in their narrowest sense and any denial of public records in response to a
valid request must be accompanied by an explanation, including legal authority,
as outlined in the Ohio Revised Code.  If the request is in writing, the
explanation must also be in writing.
(Ord. 2007-57.  Passed 12-3-07.)
109.02  PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   The City of St. Clairsville, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code,
defines records as including the following: any document--paper, electronic
(including, but not limited to, e-mail), or other format--that is created or
received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents
the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or
other activities of the office.  All records of the City of St. Clairsville are
public unless they are specifically exempt from disclosure under the Ohio
Revised Code.
   (b)   It is the policy of the City of St. Clairsville that, as required by
Ohio law, records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily
available for inspection and copying (see Section
109.05 for the e-mail record policy).  Record retention schedules are to be
updated regularly and posted prominently.
(Ord. 2007-57.  Passed 12-3-07.)
109.03  RECORD REQUESTS.
   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records.  If
it is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must
contact the requester for clarification, and should assist the requester in
revising the request by informing the requester of the manner in which the
office keeps it records.
   (b)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record.  It is the City’s general policy that this information
is not to be requested of anyone seeking public records.
   (c)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays.  Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly.  Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time.  “Prompt” and “reasonable”
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
   (d)   (1)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records.  Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so.  Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc.  If fewer than 20
pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available in an
electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be
made as quickly as the equipment allows.
      (2)   All requests for public records must either be satisfied (see
subsection (d)(1)) or be acknowledged in writing by the (public office) within
three business days following the office’s receipt of the request.  If a
request is deemed significantly beyond “routine,” such as seeking a voluminous
number of copies or requiring extensive research, the acknowledgment must
include the following:
         A.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
         B.   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
         C.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
   (e)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority.  If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released.  If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority.
(Ord. 2007-57.  Passed 12-3-07.)
109.04  COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of making
copies.
   (a)   The charge for paper copies is five cents ($0.05) per page for black
and white and fifteen cents ($0.15) per page for color.
   (b)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disk is one
dollars ($1.00) per disk.
   (c)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
   (d)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them.  They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
      (Ord. 2007-57.  Passed 12-3-07.)
109.05  E-MAIL.
   Documents in electronic mail format are defined by the Ohio Revised Code
when their content relates to the business of the office.  E-mail is to be
treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and should follow the
same retention schedules.
   (a)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business are
subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of the City are
instructed to retain  their e-mails that relate to public business (see Section
109.02, Public Records) and to copy them to their business e-mail accounts.
   (b)   The records custodian is to treat e-mails from private accounts as
records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining
them per established schedules and making them available for inspection and
copying in accordance with the Public Records Act. 
(Ord. 2007-57.  Passed 12-3-07.)
109.06  FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   The City of St. Clairsville recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences
of failure to properly respond to a public records request.  In addition to the
distrust in government that failure to comply may cause, the City of St.
Clairsville’s failure to comply with a request may result in a court ordering
the City to comply with the law and to pay the requester attorney’s fees and
damages.

(Res. 2003-36.  Passed 7-21-03.)
133.05  FIXED ASSET POLICY.
   (a)   As steward of this City’s property, the Council of the City recognizes
that efficient management and full replacement upon loss requires accurate
inventory and properly maintained property records.
   (b)   The Finance Director shall maintain a continuous inventory of all
City-owned equipment and G.A.A.P. conversion requirements.
   (c)   For purposes of this policy, “equipment” means a unit of furniture or
furnishings, an instrument, a machine, an apparatus or a set of articles which
retains its shape and appearance with use, is non-expandable, and costs at
least two thousand dollars ($2,000) as a single unit and does not lose its
identity when incorporated into a more complex unit.  For Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (G.A.A.P.)  Reporting, the minimum dollar value of an
asset to be capitalized is two thousand dollars ($2,000).
   (d)   Immovable property improvements similar to infrastructure will be
added to property values.    Maintenance costs of large fixed assets shall be
construed as repairs and will be expensed at the time repairs are rendered.
   (e)   It will be the duty of the Department Superintendents to ensure that
inventories are systematically and accurately recorded.  It will be the duty of
the Finance Director to record the additions of property and equipment by
referencing check numbers.
   (f)   The Finance Director will maintain a system of property records which
will include:
      (1)   A description of the property.
      (2)   Date of purchase.
      (3)   Initial cost.
      (4)   Location by building and fund.
   (g)   The Finance Director will contract with an outside asset valuation
firm to provide the initial valuation.  This firm will also calculate
depreciation on an annual basis.  The Finance Director will provide additions
and deletions to the firm on an annual basis, and corrections as needed.  The
firm shall provide a valuation report including depreciation for G.A.A.P.
reporting and a separate report for insurance purposes.
   (h)   The City of St. Clairsville is subject to GASB 34 Financial Reporting
effective 1/1/04 under the guidelines provided therein.  The City chooses not
to report any infrastructure acquired prior to 1/1/04 on their annual financial
reports that has not previously been reported.  This includes, but is not
limited to roads, sidewalks, streetlights, signs, traffic lights, and water/
wastewater distribution and collection lines.  Any infrastructure purchase and/
or improvement acquired after 1/1/04 will be subject to reporting as a capital
asset and depreciated for GASB 34 financial reporting.
   (i)   The Department Superintendent will prepare or instruct their employees
to prepare an inventory list for all supplies annually, on or about December 31
st.  The inventory report will include quantity on hand, description, unit cost
and total cost based on the First In First Out (FIFO) method.  This report will
be provided to the Finance Director annually, by January 31st, for the
preceding year.  If the total for any given group of supplies is less than two
thousand dollars ($2,000), a physical count is not required.  Supply groupings
include:
      (1)   Office supplies.
      (2)   Lab supplies.
      (3)   Maintenance supplies.
      (4)   Chemicals.
      (5)   Salt.

   (j)   The Department Superintendent will be responsible for notifying the
Finance Director of all fixed assets that have been disposed of and their
method of disposal.  A form will be provided to the Superintendent to use in
the sale or scrap of a fixed asset.  Any loss or theft of an item should be
reported immediately to the Director of Public Services and the Finance
Director.  An investigation will follow if determined necessary.  Major items
of equipment will be subject to spot checks to determine loss, mislocation, or
depreciation; any major loss will be reported to the Mayor and City Council. 
(Ord. 2003-57.  Passed 12-1-03.)
133.06  RETURNED ITEM POLICY.
   (a)   A returned item is defined as a demand note that has been written to
the City of St. Clairsville or an Automated Clearing House (hereinafter, ACH)
payment to the City and has been returned by the City’s depository due to non-
sufficient funds, closed account, or any other reason causing the financial
institution to reject the note by the payor.
   (b)   When a returned item is received by the City, the Director of Finance
shall write a letter to the payor informing the payor of the returned check or
ACH item.  In the event that the returned item was for utility services, the
amount shall immediately be added back to the payor’s utility account, which
may put them into an arrears position that may lead to a termination of utility
services pursuant to the Termination Ordinance 96-23.  In the event that the
returned item was for any other service offered by the City of St. Clairsville,
the payor shall be given ten working days to come to the City Building in
person to make good on the returned item with a cash payment, certified check,
money order, or credit card.  An additional fee of twenty dollars ($20.00)
shall be charged by the City for each returned item, plus whatever the
depository bank charges for returning the check or payment to the City.  In the
event that the return item was for utility services, this fee shall be added
back to the payor’s utility account; otherwise it shall be added to the amount
due to the City.  A returned ACH transaction automatically results in the
removal from the ACH process unless the return was caused by a bank error.
   (c)   If the payor of any other service, other than utilities, makes no
response within the ten working day period, the Director of Finance shall
notify the Director of Law.  The Director of Law shall write a letter to the
payor informing the payor to make the payment or criminal charges will be
filed.  If the payor of any other service, other than utilities, makes no
response within seven working days, the Director of Law shall contact the
Prosecutor’s office and file criminal charges for passing a bad check.
   (d)   The City will not accept any checks from the payor during the time
between the first notification by the City’s depository bank of the returned
item and the time that the payor makes restitution on the utility account or
for any other services offered by the City.
   (e)   If the City ultimately has no recourse to recover the funds,
recreation services and any other services provided by the City will be
immediately discontinued.
   (f)   If the City receives a second returned item from the same payor within
a six month period, the preceding steps shall apply.  In addition, the City
will no longer accept payment in the form of a personal check in the payor’s
name or anyone else’s name on their behalf.  Any and all services must be paid
in cash, by cashier’s check, money order, or credit card for the next twelve
months.  At the end of the twelve month period, when a customer is reinstated
to personal check payments, a third returned item during the following year
will result in the City no longer accepting any payments in the form a personal
check from that payor.  All future payments must be made in cash, by a
cashier’s check, money order, or credit card from that date forward.
   (g)   Upon receipt of the first returned item, the Director of Finance shall
inform the payor of the City’s policy on returned items.  The Director of
Finance shall notify the department of the actions taken against its customers.
   (h)   The Director of Finance and Utility Office Manager may make
adjustments in extenuating circumstances.
(Res. 2005-66.  Passed 11-21-05.)
133.07  DEPOSIT OF PUBLIC MONEY.
   The City’s deposit of moneys’ policy is established as follows:
   (a)   The designated employee or elected official of the City shall deposit
all public moneys received by that person with the City’s designated depository
by the business day next following the day of receipt, if the total amount of
such moneys received exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000).  If the total
amount of the public moneys so received does not exceed one thousand dollars
($1,000), the person may deposit the moneys on the business day next following
the day of receipt.  The City adopts a policy permitting a different time
period, not to exceed three business days next following the day of receipt,
for making such deposits, and the designated employee or elected official is
able to safeguard the moneys until such time as the moneys are deposited.
   (b)   The City, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 9.38(2), and in order to safeguard the
public moneys between the day received and the day deposited, adopts the
following policy for public moneys less than one thousand dollars ($1,000):
All undeposited funds shall be kept in a permanent, locked location that cannot
be easily transported from one location to another, such as a safe, a locked
filing cabinet, or a locked desk drawer.  The keys to such locations shall be
kept in a separate location, under the care of individuals responsible for
depositing the public moneys.  Drawers, cabinets and safes shall be kept locked
until time that a deposit is prepared and taken to the designated public
depository.  Under no circumstances shall moneys be left unattended or in open
view.
      (Ord. 2000-04.  Passed 3-6-00.)
133.08  INVESTMENT POLICY.
   The Investment Policy attached to Resolution 2005-40  as Exhibit A is hereby
approved and adopted as the Investment Policy for the City of St.  Clairsville
with the respect to the investment of the public funds of the City and shall
replace any and all investment policies as previously established.  (Ord. 
2005-40.  Passed 7-5-05.)
133.09  PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION OFFICER.
   (a)   The Finance Director is hereby designated the Protected Health
Information Officer for the City of St. Clairsville.
   (b)   The Finance Director, as the Protected Health Information Officer,
shall institute proper policies and procedures so as to protect the privacy of
employee protected health information that comes into the City’s possession.
(Ord. 2004-24.  Passed 6-7-04.)
133.10  CASH HANDLING POLICY.
   (a)   Cashing Checks.
      (1)   Cashing of personal checks is prohibited by all general government
offices. This includes, but is not limited to a personal check written by an
employee or anyone else to the City in exchange for cash or a City check
written to an employee for any reason.
      (2)   General government offices may accept personal checks for payment
of fees and or services; however, they are not required to accept personal
checks. General government offices should not accept a third party check for
fees and or services.
      (3)   General government should not accept personal checks if the
identity of the check holder is unknown. The check holder must provide proper
photo identification, preferably a drivers' license. The name and address on
the identification must match that printed on the front of the personal check.
On the front of the personal check, the employee must write down the state and
number of the drivers' license. The employee must also request a phone number
and record it on the front of the check.
      (4)   General government offices must never accept a check that has been
written for a larger amount than the fee and or service. No cash back will be
given under any circumstances.
      (5)   General government offices should inspect the check to determine if
it has been completed properly. It should have a date, payee, amount of the
payment in numbers and spelled out, both of these must match. It should be
properly endorsed by the check holder. You may refuse to accept payment if any
of these conditions is not met. If the check has visibly been altered, do not
accept it.
      (6)   The Finance Director will notify general government offices of
anyone that violates the NSF Policy of the City of St. Clairsville. Under that
policy, some individuals may not pay by personal check if they have made
insufficient funds payments in the past.
      (7)   As soon as a check is accepted for payment it must be stamped for
deposit only with the banking information stamp.
   (b)   Cash Drawers/Boxes.
      (1)   The departments of General Government have their own cash drawer,
box and or safe for the safekeeping of public moneys collected. Payments
received by cash, personal check, bank checks, or money orders must be kept in
a secure location with no public access. Receipts must be written for every
payment accepted. If a daily deposit is not required because the collections
are less than one thousand dollars ($1,000), the cash, checks, money orders,
and/or cashiers' checks must be kept in a safe location. A safe location at the
J.B. Martin Recreation Center is a locked safe. This safe has an opening to
insert the day's receipts. The Recreation Director, the Director's Secretary
and the permanent, full-time Rec Aide are the only people that have a key for
the safe. A safe location at the City Building for the Police Department and
Mayor's Court are locked safes. The Mayor's Secretary is also the Court Clerk
and has a safe. The combination of the safe is known only to the Court Clerk.
The Police Department safe has a slot for employees to put daily receipts. The
Chief of Police is the only person that knows the combination of the safe. The
Finance Director receives little cash, however, any cash, checks, money orders,
and/or cashiers' checks are kept in her office. The office is kept locked
whenever the Finance Director is out.
      (2)   It is the employee's responsibility to count beginning cash prior
to the day's transactions. During any period of absence from the location, the
drawer or box must be secured. Cash on hand for the beginning of each day
should remain equal and all other amounts deposited to the City's General
checking account or Mayor's Court checking account on a daily basis. Prior
legislation provides for making a deposit every three days if the amounts are
less than one thousand dollars ($1,000).
      (3)   If the amount of receipts including cash, checks, money orders and/
or cashiers' checks is greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000) on a given
day then a bank deposit is required daily.
   (c)   Daily Balancing and Making a Bank Deposit.
      (1)   It is the employee's responsibility to count the cash at the end of
the day. This amount must equal the amount of the daily receipts.
      (2)   Any outage of ten dollars ($10.00) or more is to be reported to the
Finance Director. The Finance Director will tally the receipts to confirm the
total moneys on hand. Once an outage has been confirmed, both the employee and
the Finance Director will make a written statement signed by each of them. The
Finance Director will keep a record of each employee's outages.
      (3)   Any single outage of fifty dollars ($50.00) or more must be repaid
by the employee immediately. If the employee is unable to make such
restitution, a payment plan may be agreed upon with the Finance Director.
      (4)   If an employee has three (3) separate outages in a six month
period, they will be removed from accepting payments on behalf of the City.
They will be retrained in accepting payments, adding, balancing and making
deposits.
      (5)   If an employee has an ongoing problem with shortages, the Finance
Committee will be notified and disciplinary action will be recommended which
could include days off without payor termination.
      (6)   In the event of theft, whether inside or outside, the Police
Department will be notified immediately and an investigation will be conducted.
Any employee convicted and found guilty of theft will be required to make
restitution to the City and will automatically be terminated. If the theft
resulted because of a lack of sufficient protection of public funds by an
employee, that employee will be required to make restitution. Ex: An employee
leaves the office to use the restroom and leaves $37 lying on their desk. When
the employee returns to the desk, the $37 is missing. In this case, the
employee would be required to replace the stolen $37. The employee should lock
this money in a safe place prior to leaving the office or lock the office
itself. In no event should the employee take this money with them if they have
to leave the office. 
      (7)   In the event of a robbery, the employee will not be held
responsible to replace the stolen money. If the robber has a weapon, turn over
the money to them. Do not try to overtake the robber. Do not try to discuss the
robbery. Turn over the money.
   (d)   Making a Bank Deposit.
      (1)   A bank deposit should be completed on a daily or nightly basis. The
deposit slips should be completed with the amount of coins, paper money, and
checks listed individually. In the event of a check, a name should be written
on the deposit slip next to the check amount. In the event of a return item, it
can be traced to the actual deposit. The deposit slip is tallied and the total
is written in. Also provide the number of checks in the deposit.  This amount
should agree to your balance of the day.
      (2)   If a bank bag is available, place the money, checks, and deposit
slip into the bank bag and lock it. Place the key in a safe location. If the
bag is put in a night drop, the employee must pick it up the next day at the
bank. The bag will have a deposit receipt. This receipt must match the total of
the deposit. If it does not match report it to the Finance Director, who will
make contact with the bank to correct the problem. If the deposit is made
during regular banking hours, verify the deposit amount prior to leaving the
bank and report any problems immediately to the teller. You will get the bag
and receipt back immediately.
      (3)   When a bank deposit is to be made, either during the day or after
hours, a police escort may be requested. The Police Officer is not permitted to
take the deposit for an employee. The Police Officer must escort the employee
only.
   (e)   Related Parties.  Under no circumstances should an employee accept any
payment for fees and or services for themselves or a family member. Have
another employee accept the payment and write a receipt. If the employee is
working alone at the time, wait until another employee is present to make the
payment.

   (i)   This policy shall not be construed to create any duty or obligation on
the part of the City of St. Clairsville to take any action beyond those
required of an employer by existing law.

157.01  PURPOSE; GOALS; RANDOM TESTING.
   (a)   Purpose and Goals.  Employees are our most valuable resource and their
health and safety is therefore, a serious concern.  Drug and alcohol abuse
hurts job performance through increased absenteeism, lower job efficiency and
increased accident rates.  The City will not tolerate the use of drugs or
alcohol which could imperil the health and well-being of its employees, its
services, its reputation, or others.  We are committed to maintaining a safe
and healthy workplace, free from the influence of drugs and alcohol.
   (b)   CDL Employees Testing.  The only City employees subject to random
testing shall be those who must be tested randomly pursuant to state and/or
federal law.  They include all CDL employees.  CDL employees shall be randomly
tested for:
      •   Marijuana
      •   Cocaine
      •   Opiates (Heroin)
      •   Amphetamines
      •   Phencyclidine (PCP)
      •   Alcohol
   (c)   All Employees and Potential (Post Offer) Employees.  All City
employees including CDL employees are subject at any time to reasonable
suspicion testing.  Also any post offer-pre- employment candidate shall be
mandatorily tested.  Said test shall be for:
      •   Amphetamines
      •   Cocaine
      •   Marijuana
      •   Opiates (heroin, oxycotin, etc.)
      •   Phencyclidine (PCP)
      •   Benzodiazepines (Valium)
      •   Barbiturates
      •   Methadone
      •   Propoxyphene
      •   Methaqualone (Quaaludes)
      •   Alcohol
      •   Any other prescription medications taken illegally
   NOTE: All other terms of this policy shall apply equally to CDL and non-CDL
employees, except as noted above.  (Ord.  2002-35.  Passed 9-3-02.)
157.02  STANDARDS OF CONDUCT.
   (a)   For any employee covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement, any
discharge for violation of this policy shall be considered a termination for
just cause without the need for any prior warning under Article 11, Section
11.1 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.  The reference to employees in a
safety-sensitive position includes all employees of the Water, Wastewater,
Street and Electric Department who hold a commercial driver’s license (CDL) and
who drive a 26,000 pound vehicle, a vehicle containing hazardous materials or a
vehicle designed to carry fifteen or more passengers.  These employees will be
tested for drugs and alcohol according to a random selection process as
required by law.
   (b)   The following actions are prohibited and may result in discipline up
to and including discharge:
      (1)   Any use, possession, storage, manufacturing, distribution,
dispensation or selling of drug paraphernalia, or alcohol during work hours or
while on City premises, on City business, or in City vehicles.  The presence of
over 0.02 alcohol concentration level or any illegally used drugs in an
employee’s system during working hours, just before or just after the
performance of safety-sensitive functions (driving) or while on City premises,
on City business, or in City vehicles.
      (2)   Use of alcohol off City premises that adversely affects the
employee’s attendance, work performance, the employee’s or others’ safety at
work, City property or the City reputation in the community, including alcohol
use leading to an alcohol-related conviction; and possession, use,
manufacturing, distribution, dispensation or selling or drugs off City
premises, including possession, use, manufacturing, distribution, dispensation
or selling of drugs leading to a drug-related conviction;
      (3)   Testing positive for drugs/alcohol when tested pursuant to City
policy.  (Excluding discharge for a positive test pursuant to random selection
on a first offense);
      (4)   Refusing to submit to testing or any inspection according to the
procedures outlined in this policy, or failure to cooperate in the testing or
any inspection, including refusing to sign any required form consenting to
testing and to the release of test results to the City;
      (5)   Failure to adhere to the requirements of any drug or alcohol
treatment program in which the City’s substance abuse professional refers the
employee for drug and/or alcohol related problems after a violation of this
policy or refusal to sign an agreement acknowledging the terms and conditions,
as set forth in Section
157.05, under which the employee shall participate in such treatment program;
      (6)   Use of medication prescribed for an employee by a physician and
according to the physician’s directions is not prohibited by this policy. 
However, an employee taking prescribed medication must notify his/her
supervisor of any known side effects which might affect the employee’s job
performance.  Employees must keep all prescribed medicine in its original
container which identifies the drug, date of prescription and prescribing
doctor.  The wrongful use or sale of prescribed drugs will be considered a
violation of the City’s standards of conduct.
         (Ord.  2002-35.  Passed 9-3-02.)
157.03  DRUG/ALCOHOL TESTING.
   (a)   Pre-employment Testing (Post Offer - Pre-Employment).  Each offer of
employment shall be conditioned upon the passing of a drug screening test.  The
City will not hire any applicant who fails to pass the pre-employment drug
test.
   (b)   Reasonable Suspicion Testing.  When a supervisor or City official or
employee trained to detect physical, behavioral, speech, and performance
indicators of probable alcohol and drug abuse, determines that an employee’s
work performance or on-the-job behavior indicates the use of drugs or alcohol,
the City will require the employee to submit to urine and/or breath testing to
determine drug and/or alcohol abuse.  Warning signs of drug/alcohol abuse may
include increased absenteeism, exhaustion, withdrawal from others, violent
behavior, difficulty in recalling instructions, and taking needless risks.
   (c)   Post-Accident Testing.  Whenever the City determines that an employee
was involved in an accident or in any instance of abuse of machinery, equipment
or property, the City may require the employee to submit to urine and/or breath
testing to determine drug and/or alcohol abuse.  All employees in safety-
sensitive positions who are involved in an accident involving a loss of life,
or are issued a traffic citation for violation of local or state laws or whose
vehicle must be towed from the accident scene will be tested for the presence
of alcohol and drugs within two hours.  A blood test may be given if a urine
test is not practical in the judgment of the administering facility.
   (d)   Random Testing.  All CDL employees will be tested for drugs and
alcohol according to a random selection process as required by law.
   (e)   Return-to-Duty Testing.  Any employee who tests positive in a drug or
alcohol test and is not discharged from employment must undergo and pass
follow-up testing.  The City may test for both drugs and alcohol even though
the employee initially tested positive for only one of those substances.  This
test does not create any right to return to work, but is a condition to such
return.
   (f)   Follow-Up Testing Pursuant to Participation in a Drug/Alcohol
Treatment Program.  Every employee who is given the opportunity to participate
in a rehabilitation program in lieu of termination after a violation of this
policy shall be subjected to at least six (6) periodic, unannounced tests in
the first twelve (12) months following his/her return-to-duty.  The City may
require additional testing of an employee, during a period not to exceed sixty
(60) months, from the date of the employee’s return-to-duty.  The City may test
for both drugs and alcohol even though the employee initially tested positive
to only one of those substances.
   (g)   Testing Required by Government Regulation.  The City will comply with
all federal and/or state government regulations which require testing of
employees in safety-sensitive positions.  Testing shall be conducted according
to the procedures provided under those regulations.  However, employees covered
by such government regulations may also be subject to testing under the
conditions as enumerated above.
   (h)   Refusal to Submit to Drug/Alcohol Testing.  The City may suspend or
terminate an employee, pending a full investigation of the situation, who
refuses to submit to drug and/or alcohol testing.  Refusal to submit to drug/
alcohol testing may include failing to sign a Consent and Release form for
drug/alcohol testing, intentionally failing to provide a sample, or tampering
with a sample.
   (i)   Testing Procedures and Safeguards.  The testing facility will afford
applicants and employees subject to testing the opportunity, prior to testing,
to list all prescription and non- prescription drugs they have used in the last
thirty (30) days and to explain the circumstances surrounding the use of such
drugs.  Applicants and employees subject to testing must sign, prior to
testing, any required form(s) consenting to the testing and releasing the test
results to the City.
   Drug testing includes a split specimen procedural safeguard.  Each urine
specimen is subdivided into two bottles.  If the specimen tests positive, an
employee, after a seventy-two hour period, may request an analysis of the other
specimen by another testing facility.  Alcohol testing includes a confirmation
breath testing procedural safeguard.  The testing facility will conduct two
alcohol breath tests within a 15-20 minute interval.  The testing facility will
record the lowest reading.  All testing for drugs and/or alcohol shall be done
by a licensed medical facility experienced in such testing and in a manner that
conforms to said facility’s standard testing procedures.  Tests, whether by
blood or urine analysis, shall be by split specimen.  In the event of alcohol
testing, breath tests may be administered.
   Test results and related information will be treated confidentially and
divulged to City administration only on a need-to-know basis.
   (j)   Result of Positive Drug or Alcohol Test.  If an applicant tests
positive for drugs and/or alcohol pursuant to initial testing or follow-up
testing, the City will terminate the hiring process.  The City’s testing
authority will, however, give the applicant an opportunity to explain the
positive test result to a Medical Review Officer who will determine whether or
not a “positive” result should be reported to the employer.
   An alcohol concentration of 0.04 constitutes a “positive” result.  Although
not a “positive” result, any employee found to have an alcohol concentration of
0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04 will be removed from his/her safety-
sensitive position until the start of the employee’s next regularly scheduled
duty period, but not less than 24 hours following administration of the test.
   If a driver or any employee tests positive for drugs and/or alcohol and is
not terminated, he/she will be removed from commercial motor vehicle operation
and other safety sensitive jobs or suspended without pay until he/she:
      (1)   Tests negative for drug and/or alcohol use;
      (2)   Is reevaluated by a substance abuse professional; and
      (3)   Is subject to unannounced follow-up testing.
   Compliance with the prescribed treatment and passing the test(s) will not,
however, guarantee a right of preemployment.  (Ord.  2002-35.  Passed 9-3-02.)
157.04  PENALTIES.
   The City may, at its sole discretion, discharge any employee who tests
positive for drugs or alcohol except any employee who voluntarily informs the
City that he has a drug/alcohol abuse problem, and requests assistance through
a treatment program shall not be discharged on a first offense.
   If any employee fails follow-up tests, he may be discharged at the sole
discretion of the City.
   Pre-employment positive drug/alcohol test results will dictate that the
candidate shall not be hired.  A medical review officer will discuss any
positive results with the testee.
(Ord.  2002-35.  Passed 9-3-02.)
157.05  REFERRAL EDUCATION AND TREATMENT.
   To assist employees in understanding and avoiding the perils of drug and
alcohol abuse, employees should contact the City substance abuse professional,
who can answer questions concerning this substance abuse policy and procedures,
the effects of alcohol and drug abuse and rehabilitation opportunities.  The
City encourages employees who believe they have a drug or alcohol problem to
seek the assistance of the City’s substance abuse professional.  The substance
abuse professional can refer the employee to a rehabilitation program at the
employee’s expense.
   Employees who voluntarily request the substance abuse professional’s
assistance in dealing with an alcohol or drug abuse problem prior to having
been caught in violation of this policy may do so without the knowledge of the
City and without suffering any disciplinary action.  However, voluntary
requests for assistance will not prevent disciplinary action for subsequent
violations of this policy, as employees who undergo treatment for substance
abuse must meet all established standards of conduct and job performance. 
Violators shall have 30 calendar days to enroll in a recognized treatment
program.
   While the City encourages voluntary drug and alcohol abuse treatment, it
will take strong action against employees who do not seek treatment on their
own and who violate this policy.  In addition to any disciplinary action
described in this policy, the City will refer any active duty employee to a
substance abuse professional for assessment and treatment for alcohol and/or
drug abuse.  Employees referred to the substance abuse professional as a result
of a violation of this policy and who were not terminated must comply with all
other conditions of treatment as established by the treatment program as a
condition of continued employment.  The City will terminate any employee who
tests positive for alcohol or drugs while undergoing the required treatment or
thereafter.  The employee must bear the cost of the treatment program over and
above the costs paid by the employee’s health insurance plan.
(Ord.  2002-35.  Passed 9-3-02.)
157.06  RECEIPT OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG POLICY.
   I,                                         , hereby acknowledge the receipt
of the City of St.  Clairsville’s Alcohol and Drug Policy.  I understand my
responsibility for reviewing and adhering to this policy.  I further understand

responsibility to contact the appropriate City official.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
161.     Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 161
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).  Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months.  "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules"
which prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic
cases.  Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23 referred to above.  Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under
which the Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in
Ward v. Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel.
Brockman v. Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973):  "Where, in a mayor's court, a
defendant is entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision
(C).  If a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the
defendant waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case
if (1) his compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality.  Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C):  "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any.  Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case.  Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by  Tax Administrator and the City of St.
Clairsville as the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole
income subject to the tax under this chapter/ordinance is the qualifying wages
reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City of St. Clairsville income tax with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of
either the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued
or of such corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the City of St. Clairsville the tax withheld relieves the
employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax
withheld.
      (6)     Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
City of St. Clairsville income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the
extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the
time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City of St. Clairsville until such time
as the withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator

employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City of St. Clairsville during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City of St. 
Clairsville income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's
employees and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the
tips and gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this
division, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
Occasional  Entrant - Withholding.

or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more

reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
      For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee
spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)

section, an employer is not required to withhold the City of St. Clairsville
income tax on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of
personal services in the City of St. Clairsville if the employee performed such
services in the City of St. Clairsville on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year,

and has requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying
wages as provided in Section

            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City of St. Clairsville only if the employee spent more time performing
services for or on behalf of the employer in the City of St. Clairsville than
in any other municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining
the amount of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent
performing one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have
been spent at the employee's principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City of St. Clairsville exceeds the 20-day threshold,
the employer shall withhold and remit tax to the City of St. Clairsville for
any subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City of St.
Clairsville.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City of
St. Clairsville under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold
tax for the City of St. Clairsville for the first 20 days on which the employer
paid qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the
City of St. Clairsville.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the City of  St. Clairsville
and the employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
175.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
City of St. Clairsville, regardless of the number of days which the employee
worked outside the corporate boundaries of the City of St. Clairsville.
   To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
175.04.  (Ord. 2015-45.  Passed 11-16-15.)

Clairsville's income tax return. The extended due date of the City of St.
Clairsville's income tax return shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after
the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of

the filing of the City of St. Clairsville's income tax return.

designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
175.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the City of St. Clairsville by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer as described in Section

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the City of St. Clairsville in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the

that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall

required to file a consolidated the City of St. Clairsville income tax return
for a taxable year shall file a consolidated the City of St. Clairsville income
tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and

return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated City of St. Clairsville
income tax return in the same manner as is required under the United States

by the common parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
175.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated the City of St. Clairsville
income tax return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
175.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated the City of St. Clairsville
income tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-
through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:

Section
175.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of St. Clairsville. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
175.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of St. Clairsville. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
175.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of St. Clairsville;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City of St.

chapter/ordinance on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated the City of St. Clairsville income
tax return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y)
of Section
175.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"

substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated the City of St. Clairsville
income tax return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest,
penalties, fines, charges, or other amounts imposed by the City of St.
Clairsville in accordance with this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated
group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year,
or any one or more members of such an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City of St. Clairsville before January 1, 2016, to
file a consolidated or combined tax return with the City of St. Clairsville may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1,

required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to

division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty

      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request

refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
175.21.

the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section 175.18

tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income
or wages. 
   (C)    If the City of St. Clairsville's tax rate is less than the tax rate
in the other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated
using the City of St. Clairsville's tax rate.  However, if the City of St.
Clairsville's tax rate is greater than the tax rate in the other municipality,
the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the City of
St. Clairsville, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during the
period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.

175.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the City of St. Clairsville changes as a result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the City of St. Clairsville. The amended return shall be

figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
175.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.

filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period

need be paid by the City of St. Clairsville. A request filed under this
division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's
annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is
also filed within the time prescribed in Section
175.09.

assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board

appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the

alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's

   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other City of St. Clairsville
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City of St.
Clairsville official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in
this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an
appeal with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.

to the City of St. Clairsville that arises pursuant to the City of St.
Clairsville's income tax imposed in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the City of
St. Clairsville:

      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.  (Ord. 2015-45.  Passed 11-16-15.)
175.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City of St.
Clairsville as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this
chapter and other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the
tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the City of St. Clairsville from
publishing or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose
information with respect to particular taxpayers.  (Ord. 2015-45.  Passed 11-
16-15.)
175.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City of St. Clairsville
ordinance or state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly
procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report,
return, schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or

amendment of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement,

175.19  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)     Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the

that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no

of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that

affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any

papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's

to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

affected may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk
motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, that has been left on private
residential or private agricultural property for at least four hours without
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property.  The Chief of Police, upon complaint of a repair garage or place of
storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk
motor vehicle, that has been left at the garage or place of storage for a
longer period than that agreed upon. When ordering a motor vehicle into storage

the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under subsection (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that
subsection.  The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location
designated by the Chief of Police not more than two hours after the time it is
removed from the private property, unless the towing service is unable to
deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force,
natural disaster, or other event that is not within the power of the towing
service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the

private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures.  "Private
residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section arrives after the motor
vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the
property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  However,
if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner
or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  That
fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction. 
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator.  Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.

The Chief of Police shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular motor vehicle to any person who, either in person or pursuant
to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor
vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under
subsection (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law
enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person who
identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests
information pertaining to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the vehicle, the
towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle shall give the
owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio R.C.

      (2)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

(ORC 4513.60)
303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.  If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.

         D.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.

the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

as a private tow- away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.

the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a

subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning

private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing

motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two consecutive hours without the permission of the person having

property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and

vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.

willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.

      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

the Traffic Code.  (ORC 4511.12)
(ORC 4511.12)
313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted to enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street, after
stopping.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be subject to the
provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted to enter the intersection to make the movement
indicated by the arrow signal indication, after stopping.  The right to proceed
with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow, and
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)
313.04  LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
         If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. 
hereof, the person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a
qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to
any administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person
was under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person's own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person's expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
"national highway traffic safety administration" means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. 
(ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant

otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.

(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
 
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

or parking knowing the operator does not have a valid driver’s license issued
to the operator by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507
or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
   (b)   No person shall receive a driver's license, or a motorcycle operator's
endorsement of a driver's or commercial driver's license, unless and until he
surrenders to the Registrar all valid licenses issued to him by another

fifteen years of age and who is not otherwise required by subsection (a), (b)
or (c) hereof to be secured in a child restraint system or booster seat, is
being transported in a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety
vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.01, that is required by the United States
Department of Transportation to be equipped with seat belts at the time of
manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor vehicle shall have the child
properly restrained either in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not
be used for the purpose of determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or
(d) of this section has been or is being committed.
   (f)   The Ohio Director of Public Safety shall adopt such rules as are
necessary to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat or an occupant restraining device as
required by this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the
motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.

under this section.  This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in
this State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who
otherwise would be required to be restrained under this section has a physical
impairment that makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat or an
occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).
      (2)   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty
to a violation of subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section or of a state
law or municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to any of those
subsections, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

         B.   "Public servant" has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

have occurred.

501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.   Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of                                       Maximum
Misdemeanor                                   Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed

to the Director of Law for collection in the name of the City as in other civil
cases.  (Ord. 86-13.  Passed 2-17-86.)

required under this code to be removed or shut off from or discontinued for any

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.  (ORC 2909.11)

or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

      (2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,
radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or
endangering, a misdemeanor of the second degree.  If violation of this section
creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree.  If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an
aircraft and if the violation creates a risk of physical harm to any person or

aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
 545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
 545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
 545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If

a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. 
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

not more than 250 parts per million of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD).
         B.   “Suspended solids” means solids that are either on the surface
of, or are in suspension in water, sewage or other liquids and which are
removable by laboratory filtering.

constituents for normal sewage, the excess concentration in either or both, as
the case may be, shall be subject to a surcharge as follows:
         A.   Pounds of excess suspended solids per day x $0.171/lb. =
suspended solids surcharge.
         B.   Pounds of excess BOD per day x $0.204/lb. = BOD surcharge.

990.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization City of St. Clairsville.  Article XVIII,
Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority
to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the health, safety, and
general welfare of its citizens.  Therefore, the City Council of the City of
St. Clairsville, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  Special flood hazard areas are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. 
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.  In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of St.
Clairsville as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City of St. Clairsville.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study for Belmont County, Ohio and Incorporated
areas, effective date April 5, 2006.  Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Belmont
County, Ohio and incorporated areas, effective date April 5, 2006.
      (2)   Other studies and / or maps which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   A.   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by
a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of St. Clairsville as required by Section
990.04(c).
         B.   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. 
Such maps and/or studies are on file at the Municipal Building, 100 N. Market
Street, St. Clairsville, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances (resolutions) including subdivision
regulations, zoning or building codes.  In the event of a conflict between
these regulations and any other ordinance (resolution), the more restrictive
shall be followed.  These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction
covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be
governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.  Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions.  Flood heights may be increased by man-made
or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas
of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of St. Clairsville, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 2006-
05.  Passed 3-20-06.)
990.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure.  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal.  A request for review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

   (c)   Base Flood. The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE).  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL).  In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development.  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,

storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor. See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   FloodorFlooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones.  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community. 
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:   Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS).  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation.  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus 1.5 feet of freeboard.  In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway. 
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge.  A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height.  In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following:  Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard.  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management.  Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure.  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of St. Clairsville whose historic preservation program has been
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC).  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. 
LOMC’s are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area.  A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. 
One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria.  A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure.  This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home.  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.  The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".  For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park.  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701- 27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park.  A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding.  This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods.  Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction.  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of St. Clairsville
Flood Insurance Rate Map, January 30, 1984, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person.    Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies.  An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C.
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college.  “Agency” does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle.  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect.  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer.  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor.  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area.  Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year.  Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99.  Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction.  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date.  The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation.  Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.  For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement.  This term includes structures
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed.  The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance.  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation.  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 2006-05.  Passed 3-20-06.)
990.03  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator.  The Planning and Zoning

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of St. Clairsville flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
990.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available.  These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section

by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
990.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details.  Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of St. Clairsville, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation / Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of St. Clairsville have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of St. Clairsville’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represents the City of
St. Clairsville boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of
the City of St. Clairsville suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the City of St. Clairsville has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations.  Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA.  Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard.  A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
990.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire,
etc.  After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair
process.  These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.    Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
990.04(i)(1)B. items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. 
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites:  An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a

Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.  The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of St. Clairsville specifying the maintenance responsibilities.  If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
990.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 2006-05. Passed 3-20-06.)
990.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City Council of the City of St. Clairsville shall appoint an
Appeals Board consisting of three members.  One shall be a professional
engineer, one shall be a general contractor and one shall be a resident of the
City.  The members shall serve five year terms after which time they shall be
reappointed or replaced by the City Council.  Each member shall serve until
his/her successor is appointed.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals
Board.  Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held
at the call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson.  All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law.  The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions.  Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
the City Clerk’s office in the Municipal Building of the City of St.
Clairsville.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
990.05(d).
   (e)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within fifteen days of the date of such notice and order, or other
official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the
mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator’s
decision.  Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be
filed with the Floodplain Administrator.  Upon receipt of the appeal, the
Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made to the
Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance.  The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   The City Council of the City of St. Clairsville has established
an application fee which is found in the City’s list of permit fees.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator.  Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires.  In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property.  Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
have been fully considered.  As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre,
the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.

991.09  DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illegal Discharges.  No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any
materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than storm water. The commencement, conduct or continuance of
any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as
described as follows:
   Waterline flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows; rising
ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration (infiltration is
defined as water other than wastewater that enters a sewer system, including
sewer service connections and foundation drains, from the ground through such
means as defective pipes, pipe joints, connections, or manholes. Infiltration
does not include, and is distinguished from, inflow.); uncontaminated pumped
ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains; air
conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows

of the State. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at his/her own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses
through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person
responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an
illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense,
additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge
of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid
NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with Sections
991.07 to

watercourse.
(Ord. 2013-17.  Passed 8-19-13.)
991.14   NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the State
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the City of St. Clairsville within three
business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall
be retained for at least three years.

991.27  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.

declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the

hazardous or unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not
relieve the site owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage
resulting therefrom, and shall not result in City of St. Clairsville, its

1135.01  CONDITIONAL USES; PURPOSE.
   It is recognized that an increasing number of new kinds of uses are
appearing daily, and that many of these and some other more conventional uses
possess characteristics of such unique and special nature relative to location,
design, size, method of operation, circulation, and public facilities that each
specific use must be considered individually. These specific uses are
conditionally permitted under the provisions of Chapter
1141, utilizing the procedures of this Chapter that follow.  (Ord. 2003-27. 
Passed 5-5-03.)
1135.02  CONDITIONAL USE REQUIREMENTS.
   For those uses that are conditionally permitted in Chapters
1141 or in other sections of the Code or where the use is determined to be a
substantially similar conditional use, the procedures and requirements of this
Chapter shall govern.  None of these requirements, however, shall limit the
Board of Zoning Appeals from prescribing supplementary conditions and
safeguards as provided for in Chapter
1131. 
(Ord. 2007-06.  Passed 3-19-07.)
1135.03  CONTENTS OF APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   At least one owner or lessee of property for which such conditional use is
proposed shall file an application for conditional use permit with the Board of
Zoning Appeals. At a minimum, the application shall contain the following
information:
   (a)   Name, address, and phone number of applicant;
   (b)   Legal description of property;
   (c)   Description of existing use;
   (d)   Zoning district;
   (e)   Description of proposed conditional use;
   (f)   A plan of the proposed site for the conditional use showing the
location of all buildings, parking and loading area, stormwater control,
traffic access and traffic circulation, open spaces, landscaping, lighting,
refuse and service areas, utilities, signs, yards, and such other information
as the Board may require;
   (g)   A statement explaining how the specific conditions for the specific
use will be met;
   (h)   A list of all property owners contiguous to, and directly across the
street from the property in question. 
   (i)   A fee as established in Appendix A.
      (Ord. 2007-06.  Passed 3-19-07.)
1135.04  GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
   In addition to the specific requirements for conditionally permitted uses as
specified in Chapter
1141, Board shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each
proposed use in terms of the following standards and shall find adequate
evidence showing that such use at the proposed location:
   (a)   Does the use constitute a conditional use as established under the
provisions of Chapter
1135 and appear as a conditional use in Chapter
1141 or has the use been found to be substantially similar to a conditional use
specified in Chapter
1141;
   (b)   Will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the area;
   (c)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring
uses;
   (d)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, water and sewer, and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services;
   (e)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property, or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke
fumes, glare, or odors;
   (f)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property that shall be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding roads;
   (g)   Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural,
scenic, historic feature of major importance.
      (Ord. 2003-27.  Passed 5-5-03.)
1135.05  SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   In granting any conditional use, the Board may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Ordinance. Violations of such
conditions and safeguards when made a part of the terms under which the
conditional use is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance. 
(Ord. 2003-27.  Passed 5-5-03.)
1135.06  PROCEDURE FOR HEARING, NOTICE.
   Upon receipt of the application for a conditional use permit, the Board
shall hold a public hearing, publish notice in a newspaper, and give written
notice to all parties in interest according to the procedures specified in
Chapter
1129 and
1131 of this Ordinance.
(Ord. 2003-27.  Passed 5-5-03.)
1135.07  REVIEW STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES BY THE  BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall approve an application for a conditional

to a proposed conditional use.  The following general standards shall be met.
   (a)   The proposed use is compatible with the goals of the City.
   (b)   The proposed use shall be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly
development of the district it is located in.  The Board shall look at the
location and size of the use, the  intensity of the proposed use, the parcel
size in relation to the use and the access to the site.
   (c)   The proposed will be developed so it does not hinder the appropriate
development and use of adjacent property.
   (d)   Neighborhood character and surrounding property values shall be
safeguarded.
   (e)   The proposed use shall not create offensive noise and uses that are
detrimental to the public interest of the City.
   (f)   Any parking lot shall be of adequate size for the proposed use or
uses, and shall be properly located and screened from adjoining lots.  Adequate
parking shall be provided in order to deter parking on the public street.
   (g)   The use shall be located with respect to infrastructure, such as
streets, water, sewer, etc.
   (h)   The character of the proposed uses structures shall be in harmony with
the surrounding neighborhood and shall meet all bulk requirements and code
regulations. 
   (i)   The proposed use conforms to all the regulations or this Code and
particularly to the specified supplementary regulations that apply to the use. 
   
      (Ord. 2003-27.  Passed 5-5-03.)
1135.08  ACTION BY THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS
   Within thirty (30) days after the public hearing, the Board shall approve,
approve with supplementary conditions, or disapprove the application as
presented. In taking action on a conditional use, the proposed action shall be
moved and recorded by the Board of Zoning Appeals whose names shall be noted in
the minutes.  The motion shall show the vote of each member or if absent or
refusing to vote, the motion shall note this fact. If the application is
approved or approved with modifications, the Board shall direct the Planning
and Zoning Administrator to issue a conditional use permit listing the specific
conditions specified by the Board for approval. If the Board disapproves the
application, the applicant may seek relief through the Court of Common Pleas.
Appeals from Board decisions shall be made in the manner specified in Chapter
1129 and
1131.  (Ord. 2007-06.  Passed 3-19-07.)
1135.09  EXPIRATION OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   A conditional use permit shall be deemed to authorize only one particular
conditional use and said permit shall automatically expire if, for any reason,
the conditional use shall cease for more than one (1) year.  A conditional use
is nontransferable and expires if the property is sold or transferred to
another individual.  (Ord. 2003-27.  Passed 5-5-03.)
1135.10  TEMPORARY CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a)   The following uses are deemed temporary in nature and are subject to
the specific conditions and time limitations that follow and to the regulations
of any district in which such use is located.  In addition, any use listed
within this Chapter may be conditionally permitted only upon a finding by the
Board of Zoning Appeals that such a use complies with the requirements of
Chapter
1135.
      (1)   Carnivals, circuses, tent meetings, bazaars, political rallies,
festivals, art shows, or other similar public events may be conditionally
permitted upon church, school or other similar sites within any district. 
      (2)   The temporary placement of a mobile home upon a lot which already
contains a residential structure may be permitted where the Board of Zoning
Appeals finds that special circumstances or conditions such as fires,
windstorms, or other similar events which are fully described in the findings
of the Board, have existed so that the use of a temporary residential structure
is necessary in order to prevent exceptional hardship to the applicant,
provided that such a temporary structure does not represent a hazard to the
safety, health, or welfare of the community.
   (b)   An applicant for a temporary conditional use permit must produce a
written statement from the Director of Public Services along with a permit from
the County Health Department, if applicable, approving the water supply and
wastewater disposal system of the temporary mobile home location.  Such permit
may be initially issued for the nine (9) months, renewable for up to three (3)
months for all permits, not exceeding a total of twelve (12) months.

1123.02
 
1137.01  INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this Ordinance or amendments hereinafter
adopted there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures which were
lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be
prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or
future amendments. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these non-
conformities to continue until they are discontinued as described herein, but
not to encourage their survival.
1137.02  GRACE PERIOD.
   Any property purchased or acquired in good faith for any nonconforming use
prior to the adoption of this Ordinance or amendment thereto, upon which
property the work of changing or remodeling or construction of such
nonconforming use has been legally commenced at the time of adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance may be used for the nonconforming use for which
such changing, remodeling, or construction was undertaken provided that such
work is completed within one year of the date of adoption of this Ordinance or
amendment thereto making said use nonconforming.
1137.03  SINGLE NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single
family dwelling may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective
date of adoption of this amendment, not withstanding limitations imposed by
other provisions of this Ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and
not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This
provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for
area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district. Yard
dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area or width, or
both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which
such lot is located.  Variance of yard requirements from the required standards
shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 2007-06.  Passed 3-19-07.)
1137.04  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD IN COMBINATION.
   If two or more lots, or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership, are of record at the time of amendment
of this Ordinance and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet
the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall
be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this Ordinance. All
such lots shall be required to be replatted or resurveyed, as required, to meet
the current area and frontage requirements for the required use before a zoning
permit may be issued. No portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a
manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements
established by the Ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made
which creates a lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in this
Ordinance.
1137.05  EXPANSION, SUBSTITUTION AND MODIFICATIONS OF  NONCONFORMING USES.
   Except as specifically provided in these chapters, no nonconforming use,
except when required to do so by law, shall be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed or structurally altered.
1137.06  SUBSTITUTION OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use may upon
application of a special exception to the Board of Zoning Appeals, be changed
to another nonconforming use provided that the Board shall find that the
proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than
the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board may
require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with other provisions
of this Ordinance, which if violated are punishable under Chapter
1124.
(Ord. 2007-06.  Passed 3-19-07.)
1137.07  EXPANSION OF NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS.
   (a)   This Code may permit a building containing a nonconforming use to be
enlarged to an extent not exceeding fifteen percent (15%) of the ground floor
area of the existing building or buildings devoted to a nonconforming use at
the time of enactment of this Ordinance or at a time of its amendment making a
use nonconforming. The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall not authorize
any enlargement which would result in a violation of the provisions of this
Ordinance with respect to any adjoining premises, or which would occupy ground
space required for meeting the yard or other requirements of this Ordinance
except when outlined otherwise in this section.
   (b)   This Code may permit a building or structure that is non-conforming in
its setbacks, yard or bulk requirements, to be enlarged or increase its non-
conformity to an extent not exceeding fifteen percent (15%) of the ground floor
area of the existing building/structure or buildings/structures that are non-
conforming.
(Ord. 2007-06.  Passed 3-19-07.)
1137.08  EXPANSION OF NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   The Board may authorize the expansion of nonconforming uses of open space
upon the land in ownership at the effective date of this Ordinance or the date
of any amendments making such use nonconforming, provided that such extension
is necessary and incidental to the existing properties, involves no structure
or buildings, and meets all dimensional requirements.
1137.09  MOVEMENT OF NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS.
   No nonconforming buildings or structure shall be moved in whole or in part
to any other location unless such building or structure and the yard and other
open spaces provided are made to conform to all of the regulations of the
district in which such building or structure is to be located.
1137.10  EXPANSION OF RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES IN NONRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   Any residential structure which is nonconforming due to the fact of its
being in a district that prohibits residences may be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed, or structurally altered provided it meets with the requirements
of an appropriate residential district determined by the Planning and Zoning
Administrator. (Ord. 2007-06.  Passed 3-19-07.)
1137.11  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that
the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased
except as otherwise outlined in this section. Nothing in this Chapter shall be
deemed to prevent any strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any
building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with
protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.  (Ord. 2007-06. 
Passed 3-19-07.)
1137.12  DAMAGED NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   Any nonconforming structure that is damaged or deteriorated more than fifty
(50) percent of its current fair market value at the time of damage may not be
reconstructed and used as before the damage occurred. For the purpose of this
Chapter a structure shall be considered as deteriorated when the Planning and
Zoning Administrator determines that at least 50 percent of the main structural
members have collapsed. In such instances new construction shall conform to all
dimensional requirements as required by this Ordinance. If the damage is fifty
(50%) percent or less of its current fair market value, it may be reconstructed
to conform with previous dimensional characteristics and the previous use may
be permitted if such reconstruction begins within six (6) months and is
completed within one and one-half (1 ½) year. The six (6) month provision may
be extended by the Board of Zoning Appeals only where evidence is submitted
that the applicant is awaiting an insurance settlement, State Building Code
approval or that construction cannot begin because of a severe weather
condition or that the damage was the result of a natural disaster experienced
in the City that makes it difficult for the owner to obtain contractor
assistance. In the case of a damaged structure, the owner shall also have
debris removed within thirty (30) days except as provided above.  (Ord. 2007-
06.  Passed 3-19-07.)
1137.13  DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING USES AND SIGNS.
   When any nonconforming use or sign is voluntarily discontinued or abandoned
for more than six (6) months any new use or sign shall not thereafter be used
except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is
located.  Any nonconforming use or sign that is superseded by a permitted use
shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district and the
nonconforming use or sign may not thereafter be resumed.
(Ord. 2007-06.  Passed 3-19-07.)

parking system.  Such defined parking areas should be delineated and accented
by landscaped areas.
      (4)   The maximum PRD and PUD density shall be ten (10) dwelling units
per acre based upon the number of units proposed divided by the net developable
site.  The open space must be aggregated into usable areas of at least .25
acres or more.  Linear open space along or near the community bikeway is
encouraged.  In the case of linear open space the .25 acre requirement is
waived. 
      (5)   The maximum PCND density shall be ten (10) dwelling units per acre
based upon the number of units proposed divided by the gross developable site
(including open space).
      (6)   Under PRD and PUD a minimum of twenty (20) percent of the net site
(gross site minus publicly dedicated streets and alleys) shall be set aside as
public open space. Such open space shall be used for such public purposes as a
natural area, recreational area, or the site of a community or school facility.
      (7)   Under PCND no less than fifty-percent (50%) of the total gross area
of the site shall be set aside as common open space. Open space land may, at

shall be suitable for the Planned Conservation Development in relation to the
location, number and types of buildings it is intended to serve.  In any case,
it shall be highly accessible to all residents or users of the planned
development.  Entry features, detention and retention basins shall not be
included in the area required for common open space.
         B.   The common open space shall be used for amenity or recreational
purposes. Any uses and/or buildings authorized for the common open space must
be appropriate to the scale and character of the planned development in
relation to its size, density, expected population, topography, and the type of
dwellings.
         C.   The common open space may be suitably improved for its intended
use, but common open space containing natural features worthy of preservation
such as slopes over twelve (12) percent and wooded areas may be left
unimproved.  The buildings, structures, and improvements which are permitted in
the common open space must be appropriate to the uses which are authorized for
the common open space and must conserve and enhance the amenities of the common
open space with regard to its topography and unimproved condition.
      (8)   Under PCD and PUD where applicable all service and delivery shall

appropriate form of access to the lots and/or structures.
      (11)   Under PRD, PUD and PCND off-street parking shall be provided in
accordance with Chapter 1185, except residential parking may be provided in
group garages or parking lots within one hundred and fifty (150) feet of the
dwellings served. 
      (12)   Under PCD, PUD, and PCND where appropriate whenever multiple
structures are to be located on the site and the site abuts a collector or
arterial street, access onto the collector or arterial shall be via interior
local streets or marginal access (frontage) roads.  All uses within the PCD,
PUD, and PCND shall derive their access from the interior streets in the
district, unless specific exemptions are made as a part of the approved
Development Plan.

or welfare.
      (16)   All utilities shall be placed underground and all utility boxes
shall be screened.
   (d)   Conflict With Other Chapters.  Because of the special characteristics
of Planned Conservation Developments, special provisions governing the
development of land for this purpose are required.  Whenever there is a
conflict or difference between the provisions of Chapter
1141 and those of the other Chapters of this Ordinance, the provisions of the
stricter of the ordinances shall prevail.  Subjects not covered by this Chapter
shall be governed by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this
Ordinance.
   (e)   Relationship to the Subdivision Regulations.  The uniqueness of each
proposal for a Planned Conservation Development may require that there be
modification from the specifications established in the Subdivision Regulations
of St. Clairsville, Ohio. Modifications may be incorporated into the plan by
the developer only after the review of the Planning and Zoning Administrator.
   (f)   Utilities.  The following regulations apply to the provision of
utilities in Planned Conservation Developments.
      (1)   Planned Conservation Developments shall have an adequate source of
potable water.  All water lines constructed within a Planned Conservation
Development shall be at the financial responsibility of the owner or developer.
      (2)   The owner or developer of a Planned Conservation Development shall
be financially responsible for the extension of the existing network of
sanitary sewage lines to serve the planned development area.  No construction
of buildings within any segment of a Planned Conservation Development shall be
commenced until after the extension of sanitary sewage lines has been
completed.
      (3)   The following utility equipment shall be provided, constructed and
installed underground within a planned development: gas lines, sanitary and
storm sewer lines, water lines, electrical lines, telephone lines, and cable
television lines.

and method as to preserve the natural features of the land such as streams,
rock outcropping, topsoil, trees and shrubs and the same shall be incorporated
into and with the landscaping of said lands.
      (5)   Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall
be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be of adequate width to
facilitate the proposed usage.
      (6)   All utility boxes shall be screened.
   (g)   Storm Water Management.  Due to the size and nature of Planned
Conservation Developments and the fact that several types of developments may
be exempt from platting requirements, all site plans must have a storm water
management plan, approved by the Director of Public Service, with the
improvements constructed before a zoning certificate will be issued for
construction of buildings.
   (h)   Walkways.  All Planned Conservation Developments where the average lot
frontage is less than ninety (90) feet shall be provided with concrete
sidewalks on both sides of the street throughout the development.  All other
walkways shall be constructed of a suitable, dust free, hard surface material. 
Mulch or other similar surfaces may be permitted for walking trails in areas
the Planning Commission feels are appropriate.
   (i)   Trees.
      (1)     The clearing of land shall be kept to a minimum to help preserve
the existing natural conditions.
      (2)     No land shall be cleared of trees eight (8) to ten (10) feet away
from the existing tree canopy.  An exception to this requirement shall be
granted in the case of those trees which should be removed due to malformation,
disease, safety hazards, or to the general benefit of surrounding trees.  The
foregoing shall be considered as a guideline for preservation of the natural
environment.

1143.09  MAINTENANCE OF OPEN SPACE IN PCND.
   (a)   The ultimate owner of the open space shall be responsible for raising
all monies required for operations, maintenance, or physical improvements to
the open space through annual dues, special assessments, etc. The owner shall
be authorized under its bylaws to place liens on the property of residents who
fall delinquent in payment of such dues, assessments, etc.
   (b)   In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
common open space shall at any time after establishment of the planned
development fail to maintain the common open space in reasonable order and
condition in accordance with the Final Development Plan, the Planning and
Zoning Administrator may serve written notice upon such organization or upon
the residents of the Planned Conservation Development setting forth the manner
in which the organization has failed to maintain the common open space in
reasonable condition.  The notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies
of maintenance be cured within thirty (30) days thereof, and shall state the
date and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held within fourteen (14)
days of the notice.  At such hearing the City Council may modify the terms of
the original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension of time
within which they shall be cured.  If the deficiencies set forth in the
original notice or in the modifications thereof shall not be cured within said
thirty (30) days or any extension thereof, the City Council, in order to
preserve the taxable values of the properties within the planned development
and to prevent the common open space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter
upon said common open space and maintain the same for a period of one (1)
year.  Said entry and maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to
use the common open space.  Before the expiration of said year, the City
Council shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of the organization
thereto-fore responsible for the maintenance of the common open space, call a
public hearing upon notice to such organization, or to the residents of the
planned development, to be held by the City Council, at which hearing  such
organization or the residents of the planned development shall show cause why
such maintenance by the City Council shall not, at the election of the City
Council, continue for a succeeding year.  If the Municipal Council shall
determine such organization is ready and able to maintain said common open
space in reasonable condition, the Municipal Council shall cease to maintain
said common open space at the end of said year.  If the City Council shall
determine such organization is not ready and able to maintain said common open
space in a reasonable condition, the Municipal Council may, in its discretion,
continue to maintain said common open space during the next succeeding year and
subject to a similar hearing and determination, in each year thereafter.  The
decision of the Municipal Council in any such case shall constitute a final
administrative decision subject to review as provided by law.
   (c)   The cost of such maintenance by the Municipality shall be assessed
against the properties within the planned development that have a right of
enjoyment of the common open space, and shall become a tax lien on said
properties.  The Municipality, at the time of entering upon said common open
space for the purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of such lien in the
office of the Belmont County Recorder, upon the properties affected by such
lien within the planned development.

1144.03  DEFINITIONS.
   The following definitions shall be applicable in the TND District. When
there are conflicts between the terms used herein and definitions as provided
elsewhere in the Code of Ordinances, the provisions of this district shall take
precedence. Terms used throughout this district shall take their commonly
accepted meaning unless otherwise defined in the Code of Ordinances. Terms
requiring interpretation specific to this district are as follows:
   (1)   "A" Street.  A street which is designed with, or otherwise
characterized by, features that promote the safety, comfort, and convenience of
pedestrians, and does so in a relatively exceptional way.  Such streets
typically feature sidewalks at least five feet wide, narrow streets, buildings
pulled up close to the street, no front yard off-street parking, pedestrian-
scaled lighting, on-street parking, landscaped medians, articulated building
walls, aligned building facades, a building entrance on the street, modest
turning radii, trash receptacles remote from the sidewalk, and outdoor
mechanical equipment on the side, rear or roof of buildings.
   (2)   Alley. A vehicular passageway providing secondary and/or service
access to the sides or rear of building lots.
   (3)   Artisanal Use. The manufacture and sale of artifacts utilizing only
hand-held and/or table-mounted electrical tools. Such a use must be contained
within a completely enclosed building.
   (4)   Block. The gross area of lots and adjacent alleys, circumscribed by
streets.
   (5)   Civic Building. A building, either publicly or privately owned,
located on a civic lot used for any permitted or required civic use.
   (6)   Colonnade. A roof or building structure, extending over the sidewalk,
open to the street and sidewalk except for supporting columns or piers. 
Awnings are permitted within the TND but are not considered colonnades.
Colonnades shall not cause roof drainage into the public right-of-way.
   (7)   Cornice Line. A molded and projecting horizontal member that crowns an
architectural composition. A cornice line shall project a minimum of 2 inches
from the front elevation of the structure.
   (8)   Drive-through. Establishments which provide services or sales that are
extended mechanically or personally to customers who do not exit their
motorized vehicle. Such facilities include banking facilities, restaurants,
food sales, dry cleaning, express mail services and other services. Not
included in this definition are auto fuel pumps and depositories which involve
no immediate exchange or dispersal to the customer, such as mailboxes, library
book depositories and recycling facilities.
   (9)   Edge Area. A continuous open area which defines and buffers the edge
of a TND and each neighborhood proper. Edge areas shall be preserved in
perpetuity to buffer adjacent land uses, preserve natural areas, and provide

street wall parallel to the street. When used, brick-paved sidewalks or tree
grates may be required to be constructed using engineered soil to accommodate
root growth for long-term tree stability and infrastructural compatibility.
This tree arrangement forms an intimate, comfortable, dignified public place
along a corridor. The arrangement is often useful to visually "narrow down" a
corridor when facing buildings on a street are set too far apart or are of
insufficient height to establish a comfortable street width to building height
ratio of 3:1 to 1:1.
   (12)   Front Porch.  An un-air conditioned roofed structure attached to the
front and along a side walked street side of the unit, having a minimum depth

railing height allowed by the Standard Building Code. All or a portion of the
front porch may encompass a ramp providing handicap access. Front porches may
encroach up to 10 feet beyond the build-to line.
   (13)   Frontage.  That side of a lot abutting a street right-of-way. When a
lot abuts more than one street, it is that side that abuts the more primary
street or the street designed for the highest pedestrian volume. For a corner
lot, all sides abutting a street shall be considered frontage.
   (14)   Lodging Use.  Buildings providing food service and bedrooms for rent

sales lot, shall be developed and maintained in accordance with the following
requirements:
   (a)   Minimum Distance.  Except in the TND, PUD, CD, and Downtown District,
no part of any parking area for more than five (5) vehicles shall be closer
than twenty (20) feet to any dwelling unit, school, hospital or other
institution for human care located on an abutting or adjoining lot, unless
separated by a solid wood privacy fence or other approved constructed screen of
between four (4) and seven (7) feet in height. 
   (b)   Location  Relative to Use.  Off-street parking facilities shall be
located on the same or contiguous lot(s) as the structure or use served, except
that a parking facility providing the sum of parking space required of several
uses may be provided contiguous and in common to the several structures and
uses served.  Parking spaces may be located on a lot other than that containing
the principal use provided it is within three hundred (300) feet of the
principal use, with the approval of the Planning Commission, and subject to
meeting all applicable requirements of this Ordinance.
   (c)   Parking Lot Layout.  Whenever a parking lot extends to a property line
or where the extension of a vehicle beyond the front line of the parking space
would interfere with drive or aisle access, wheel blocks or other devices shall
be used to restrict such extension.
   (d)   Surfacing.  All off-street parking areas shall be graded for proper
drainage and surfaced with concrete, asphalt, stationary cobblestones, or brick
so as to provide a durable and dustless surface.  Off-street parking area
designs shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning and Zoning Administrator
prior to issuance of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance.
   (e)   Illumination.  Any parking lot intended to be used during non-daylight
hours shall be illuminated.  Illumination of parking lots shall be so arranged
as to reflect light away from adjacent properties and shall provide not less

vehicular access to a street or alley abutting the property upon which the
parking area is provided or to an adjacent parking area.
1148.05  ACCESS DRIVES.
   The frequency of access points along thoroughfares in St. Clairsville is to
be minimized to reduce vehicle and pedestrian conflict and improve traffic
flow.  Access drives (driveways) leading to and from a street shall be
developed according to the following standards:
   (a)   Width.  An access drive serving a single family residence shall be a
minimum of ten (10) feet in width.  Access drive entrances at a street shall be
a minimum of eighteen (18) feet in width.  All access drives shall not exceed
twenty-five (25) feet in width, except at curb returns.
   (b)   Spacing.  The following standards shall apply to determining the
permitted spacing of access drives.  Street classifications are based upon the
interpretation of the Director of Public Service relative to street
classification.
      (1)   For all arterials and collectors, the following minimum spacing
related to posted speed limit shall be required between adjacent access drives:
 
POSTED HIGHWAY  MINIMUM SPACING
SPEED (mph)     (feet)
25              75
30              100

one hundred (100) feet to an intersection.
   (c)   Side Lot Lines.  An access drive, exclusive of curb returns, shall be
located no less than ten (10) feet from the side lot line, except that an
access drive for a residential use may be within three (3) feet of a side lot
line.  Access drives for any uses utilizing a common drive may be adjacent to
and coterminous with a side lot line.
   (d)   Quantity Permitted.  The number of access drives shall be kept to a
minimum to promote safe and reasonable access, improve the convenience and ease
of movement of travelers, and permit reasonable speeds and economy of travel
while maintaining roadway capacity.  For lots with less than two hundred (200)
feet of frontage on public right(s)-of-way and with less than five (5) acres in
total area, no more than two (2) access drives shall be permitted.  For lots
with more than two hundred (200) feet of road frontage on public right(s)-of-

1151.021 COMPUTATIONS.
   The following principals shall control the computation of sign area and sign
height.
   (a)   Computation of Area of Individual Signs.  The area of a sign face
(which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face)
shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle,
or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color
forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence
or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations
and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
   (b)   Computation of Area of Multi-faced Signs.  The sign area for a sign
with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all
sign faces visible from any one point.  When two identical sign faces are
placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the
same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are
not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the
measurement of one of the faces.
   (c)   Computation of Height.  The height of a sign shall be computed as the
distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest
attached component of the sign.  Normal grade shall be construed to the lower
of (1) existing grade prior to construction or (2) the newly established grade
after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating
solely for the purpose of locating the sign.  In cases in which the normal
grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the
assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is
equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or
the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on
the zone lot, whichever is lower.
   (d)   Computation of Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area for a Zone Lot.  The
permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a zone lot shall be
computed by applying the formula contained in the sign chart, to the lot
frontage, building frontage, or wall area, as appropriate, for the zoning
district in which the lot is located.  Lots fronting on two or more streets are
allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage.  However, the total
sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the
portion of the lot’s total sign area allocation that is derived from the lot,
building, or wall area frontage on that street.
      (Ord.  2003-27. Passed 5-5-03.)

1157.01  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide requirements for the use or
occupation of any and all rights of way and public property in the City, the
issuance of permits to persons for such use or occupancy and to set forth the
policies of the City related thereto.
   (b)   This chapter does not take the place of any franchise, license, or
permit which may be additionally required by law. Each permittee shall obtain
any and all such additional franchises, licenses or permits necessary to the
operations and conduct of its business.
   (c)   No person shall use, occupy, own or operate facilities in, under or
over any rights of way within the City unless such person first obtains a
franchise and/or permits conforming to the requirements set forth therein and
in this chapter.
   (d)   The policy of the City with regard to rights of way is hereby declared
to be:
      (1)   To promote public safety and protect public property;
      (2)   To promote the utilization of rights of way for the public health,
safety and welfare and to promote economic development in the City;
      (3)   To promote the availability of a wide range of utility,
communication and other services, including the rapid deployment of new
technologies and innovative services, to the City's citizens and taxpayers at
reasonable rates;
      (4)   To promote cooperation among the City and franchisees and
permittees in the occupation of rights of way, and work therein, in order to
minimize public inconvenience during work in the rights of way and avoid
uneconomic, unneeded and unsightly duplication of facilities;
      (5)   To ensure adequate public compensation for the regulation of the 
private use of the rights of way and the regulation thereof; and
      (6)   To promote and require reasonable accommodation of all uses of
rights of way and to establish the following priority of use of rights of way,
when all requested usage of rights of way by permittees cannot be accommodated:
         A.   Use by the City;
         B.   Use by another governmental entity with the City's concurrence or
other uses required by law;
         C.   Telecommunications and utility and general permittees and
franchisees shall have third priority;
         D.   Special permittees shall have fourth priority; and
         E.   Residential permittees shall have the fifth priority; provided, 
however, that the Director may reasonably require right of way permittees and
franchisees to cooperate to accommodate use by other permittees and franchisees
and provided further that the Director may alter this priority when the
Director reasonably determines a deviation herefrom to be in the public
interest.
   (e)   Nothing in this chapter should be construed to apply the provisions of
this chapter to facilities owned or operated by the City or any of its
operations.
   (f)   Unless otherwise specifically stated in a permit, all permits or
franchises granted hereunder shall be non-exclusive.

1157.04  PROCEDURE FOR PERMITS; TERMS.
   (a)   Applicants for cable television franchises shall be granted a cable
television franchise pursuant to the City's franchise agreement; provided,

other right of way use by such  franchisee shall require a separate permit.
   (b)   Applicants for telecommunication and utility permits, or renewals
thereof shall file an application therefor in such form as the Director may
require along with an application fee of one thousand dollars ($1,000). The
Director shall determine if the applications are in order and, if so, forward
the application to Council to determine whether or not, in accordance with
Section
1157.05, the applicant should be granted a permit hereunder. Council shall make
a final determination as to whether or not such permit should be granted and if
so, upon what terms and conditions.
   (c)   Applicants for special permits, or renewals thereof, shall file an
application therefor, in such form as the Director requires along with an

in such form as the regulations require, along with an application fee of ten
dollars ($10.00). The Director, or the Director's designate, shall determine if
the application is in order and, if so, shall grant the application so long as
the Director also finds, in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section
1157.05, that the application should be granted. Residential permits shall be
valid until canceled by the Director upon sixty days written notice to the
permittee; provided, however that upon a finding by the Director that an
emergency exists the Director may cancel any such permit upon such lesser
notice as is necessary under the circumstances.
   (e)   Any applicant may appeal the failure of the Director to grant a permit
or to recommend it to be granted upon terms and conditions acceptable to the
applicant. In order to perfect such appeal, the applicant shall file, within
ten days of the Director's determination or recommendation or ninety days of

of any permit.
      (5)   Any contractor proposed for work of construction, installation,
operation, maintenance, and repair of system equipment  must be properly
licensed under laws of the State, and all local ordinances. The contractor's or
permittee's system and associated equipment erected by the contractor or
permittee within the City shall be so located as to cause minimum interference
with the proper use of streets, alleys and other public ways and places, and to
cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of
property owners who adjoin any of said streets, alleys or other public ways and
places. No pole or other fixtures placed in any public ways by the contractor
or permittee shall be placed in such a manner as to interfere with normal
travel on such public way.

million dollars ($5,000,000) as determined by the Director), an irrevocable
letter of credit acceptable to the City or a certified check in an amount
determined by the Director to pay the cost of restoration of the right of way
should the permittee fail to perform restoration required by this chapter or
the permit or to pay for the cost of removal or relocation of the system
required by this chapter should the permittee fail to perform said removal or
relocation.
   (c)   Right of Way Work Permit Required. All permittees shall obtain a right
of way work permit from the Director prior to beginning the erection,
installation or maintenance including tree trimming, of any lines or equipment.
Prior City approval shall not be required for emergency repairs, routine
maintenance and repairs, operations which do not require excavation in the
public right of way, blockage of any street or alley or material disruption to
any landscaping or structures and/or irrigation systems. The permittee, and/or
its subcontractors shall leave the streets, alleys, and other public places
where such work is done in as good condition or repair as they were before such
work was commenced and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City. Such right
of way work permit shall be issued in writing and is subject to conditions that
may be attached by the Director including, but not limited to, requirements
concerning traffic control, safety scheduling, notification of adjoining
property owners, and restoration with seed, sod or specific plant materials as
directed by the City of St. Clairsville. The permittee and/or its

party users of its poles and conduit.
   The City shall pay the permittee the reasonable cost to make the poles or
conduit ready for the City's use and occupancy. Nothing herein shall be
construed to require a permittee to construct poles or conduits where none

   (a)   Antenna support structures with antenna may be located as follows:
      (1)   On property or existing buildings in any commercial or industrial
zone where located not closer than five hundred (500) feet from any residential
unit in any residential zone.  Support structures shall be excluded from City
park, cemetery, and museum property, provided that public communication
structures qualifying as essential services as defined in this Chapter shall
not be so excluded.
      (2)   On property or existing buildings in any residential zone where
located not less than five hundred (500) feet from any residential unit in any
residential zone, subject to review by the Planning and Zoning Administrator. 
Support structures shall be excluded from City park, cemetery, and museum
property, provided that public communication structures qualifying as essential
services as defined in this Chapter shall not be so excluded.
   (b)   Antennas and antenna arrays, independent of antenna support structures
normally accompanying their use, may be located as follows:
      (1)   On existing buildings or structures in commercial and industrial
zones.
      (2)   In any zone on existing tall structures, excluding those provided
for in Section
1159.02 and
1159.03, such as communication towers, power transmission towers and poles,
stadium and athletic field lighting standards, water storage tanks, street
light standards along expressways and major and regional streets as defined by
the City's thoroughfare plan, and on or within other similar tall structures as
determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator.
   (c)   Structures for housing of equipment required to operate an antenna,
not higher than twelve (12) feet above grade nor greater than three hundred
(300) square feet in area, may be constructed in proximity to an antenna
support structure or existing tall structure as accessory to each antenna array
or user of an antenna support structure. A single, larger structure may be
built for multiple users, provided that total floor area does not exceed six
hundred (600) square feet. An equipment structure may also be treated as a
mechanical appurtenance or penthouse on the roof of an existing building on
which the antenna, antenna array, or antenna support structure is erected.
Where the equipment structure is erected at grade, color and character of the
exterior surface shall be aesthetically and architecturally compatible with
buildings in the surrounding area.
   (d)   Antenna support structures shall maintain a setback from the nearest
property line a distance at least equal to the height of the structure,
provided that a structure mounted on the roof of a building shall not be so
restricted.
   (e)   Overall antenna height covered under this Section shall be limited to
not more than one hundred ninety-five (195) feet above grade.
   (f)   Required submittals accompanying applications:
      (1)   Applicant must provide a written statement that the proposed
antenna and antenna support is compliant with: antenna and antenna support
structure site federal registration; maximum exposure to non-ionizing radiation
and ionizing radiation standards, singly or as co-located, recertified
biannually.
      (2)   Applicant must provide an analysis of the visual impact of the
antenna support structure on the surrounding area. Such analysis shall include
points-of-view renderings of the structure to scale in its proposed setting,
with special attention to adjoining residential areas, including proposed
landscaping to screen the structure base and accessory building.
   (g)   No placement of new antenna support structures shall be permitted
unless the Planning Commission finds credible evidence establishing to a
reasonable certainty one or more of the following:
      (1)   No existing antenna support structure, tall structure or building
is located in the area in which the applicant's equipment must be located, or
      (2)   No existing antenna support structure, tall structure or building
in the area is of sufficient height to meet the applicant's requirements and
the deficiency cannot be remedied at reasonable cost, or
      (3)   No existing antenna support structure, tall structure or building
within the area has sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's
equipment and the deficiency cannot be remedied at reasonable cost, or
      (4)   Electromagnetic interference would occur between the applicant's
and existing equipment and such interference cannot be eliminated at reasonable
cost, or
      (5)   The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner to
co-locate on existing antenna support structure, tall structure or building are
unreasonable relative to industry norms, or
      (6)   The applicant demonstrates that there are other factors that render
existing antenna support structures, tall structures or buildings unsuitable or
unavailable for co-location.  The cost of eliminating impediments to co-
location shall be deemed reasonable if it does not exceed by twenty-five (25)
percent of the cost of constructing a new antenna support structure on which to
mount the applicant's equipment.
   (h)   If the Planning Commission determines it necessary to consult with an
expert in considering the factors listed in subsection (7) above, all
reasonable costs and expenses associated with such consultation shall be borne
by the applicant. Failure to pay such costs and expenses or provide information
requested by the Planning Commission shall be grounds for denial or the
withholding of the issuance of a building permit until such costs have been
paid.
   (i)   Unless shown to be unreasonable, a condition of approval shall be to
construct an antenna support structure so as to accommodate the co-location of
at least three additional antenna arrays similar in size and function to that
placed by the applicant. The additional co-location-sites shall be made
available at prevailing rates in the industry and under standard contractual
provisions. Failure to do so shall be considered grounds for denying approval
or voiding of approvals given.
   (j)   Any modification which significantly alters the appearance, height, or
structural integrity of an antenna support structure or which involves the
installation of antenna equipment differing in size or function from that
previously installed shall require the approval of the Planning Commission
under this Chapter.
   (k)   Additional approval by the Planning Commission shall not be required
for co- location on an existing antenna support structure, provided the co-
located antenna array and equipment is similar in size and function to that
installed by the applicant of the approved antenna support structure. Such co-
location shall be subject to review and approval of the Planning and Zoning
Administrator.
   (l)   No advertising or business signs shall be allowed on structures
covered under this section.
   (m)   No signals, lights or illumination not required by the FCC, FAA, or
City may be placed on structures covered by this Section. Any such required
signal or light shall be shielded to prevent downward transmission of light.
   (n)   Antenna support structures shall have an exterior finish that
preserves their structural integrity and visual appearance.
   (o)   Structures covered under this Section shall require a permit prior to
erection, enlargement, increase in height or relocation. The application for a
permit shall include construction drawings showing the proposed method of
installation, including details of structural support, footing, foundation,
guys, braces, anchors, and such other information as required by the Planning
and Zoning Administrator to assure proper engineering practice. A site plan and
other illustration drawn to scale shall be provided showing the lot or parcel
on which the structure is to be erected, all structures on site, all structures
within two hundred (200) feet of the site, all structural elements, and all
other relevant information.
   (p)   Antenna support structures shall be inspected annually and maintained
in a safe condition by the owner or operator. Such owner or operator shall
notify the Planning and Zoning Administrator if requisite safety requirements
are no longer being met and the steps being taken to remedy the situation. The
owner or operator shall maintain inspection reports on file and a log of
routine maintenance as well as work undertaken in response to inspection
reports.
   (q)   The owner or operator of an antenna or antenna support structure shall
give notice to the Planning and Zoning Administrator when such equipment is no
longer in use. Any such equipment no longer used for a continuous period of six
(6) months or which no longer meets safety standards in the view of the
Planning and Zoning Administrator shall be removed; it shall be removed within
sixty (60) days of written notice by the City to do so. If not removed within
such sixty (60) day period, the City may remove it at the owner's expense.

1165.01  GENERAL STATEMENT.
   The regulations, ordinances and rules herein, and the City's Construction
Regulations, ordinances and Zoning Regulations, shall control the manner in
which streets, lots and other elements of a subdivision are arranged on the
land. These design controls shall help insure convenient and safe streets,
creation of usable lots, and provision of space for public utilities. The
planning of attractive and functional neighborhoods shall be promoted,
minimizing the undesirable features of unplanned, haphazard growth.
   The City Planning Commission and the Director of Public Service has the
responsibility for reviewing the design of each future subdivision early in its
design development. The Commission shall insure that all of the requirements
are met. Details of the development shall then be relayed to Council who has
the sole authority for final approval and disapproval of the subdivision.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1165.02  CONFORMITY TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND ZONING.
   The arrangement, character, width and location of all streets or extensions
thereof shall conform with the Construction Regulations, these standards and
ordinances. Streets not contained in the aforementioned standards shall conform
to the recommendation of the Director of Public Service based upon the design
standards set forth herein and in the Construction Regulations and ordinances.
In addition, no final plat of land within the area in which an existing zoning
ordinance, or resolution is in effect shall be approved unless it conforms with
such ordinance or resolution.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1165.03  SUITABILITY OF LAND.
   If Council finds that land proposed to be subdivided is unsuitable for
subdivision development due to flooding, bad drainage, topography, inadequate
water supply, inadequate wastewater treatment, transportation facilities and
other such conditions which may endanger health, life or property and, if, from
investigations conducted by the public agencies concerned, it is determined
that in the best interest of the public the land should not be developed for
the purpose proposed, Council shall not approve the land for subdivision unless
adequate methods are advanced by the subdivider for solving the problems that
will be created by the development of the land.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1165.04  APPROVAL OF DETAILED ENGINEERING DESIGN PLANS  FOR ALL PUBLIC
UTILITIES.
   Detailed plans and specifications for all improvements shall be approved in
writing by the Director of Public Service before any construction shall
proceed.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1165.05  SECURITY FOR CONSTRUCTION.
   In lieu of constructing improvements, the subdivider may apply for final
plat approval by insuring completion of the required improvements by one of the
following methods:
   (a)    A surety performance bond may be posted with the City sufficient to
cover the full cost of such improvements as estimated by officials having
jurisdiction, to assure the satisfactory installation of such improvements in
accordance with its regulations.
   (b)    A certified check may be posted with the City sufficient to cover the
full cost of such improvements as estimated by officials having jurisdiction,
to assure the satisfactory installation of such improvements in accordance with
its regulations.
      (Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1165.06  TIME FOR CONSTRUCTION OF IMPROVEMENTS AND GUARANTY.
   All required improvements shall be constructed within two years of the
acceptance of the final plat by Council.
   For a period of one year from the date the constructed improvements were
accepted by Council, the subdivider shall make such repairs or replacements as
may be required by reason of defective workmanship or material, as determined
by the Director of Public Service and a competent engineer, and a satisfactory
guaranty shall be furnished to the City in the amount of five percent (5%) of
the constructed cost of the improvement being guaranteed.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1165.07  AS-BUILT DRAWINGS.
   The developer shall have a competent engineer submit as-built drawings from
all subsurface facilities to be owned and operated by the City. These drawings
shall be submitted and accepted in writing by the City before the plat is
approved, or if plat approval is to be gained prior to completion, a sum of
money shall be escrowed in an amount sufficient to cover plan completion.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1165.08  RELEASE OF MORTGAGES.

City of the review of the plans and specifications, inspection and engineering
supervision of construction by the engineer and expenses incident to such
improvements. If required by the City, the subdivider shall deposit such sums
of money as are estimated to be necessary for the foregoing purposes, and in
the event that such estimated amounts are found to be insufficient, shall
deposit such additional sum as may be necessary. All unexpended moneys so
deposited are to be refunded.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1165.10  MASTER PLAN.
   When a large scale development is contemplated to be constructed in phases,
the developer may be required to submit a master plan for the entire project
area, even though the land to be platted represents only a portion of the total
area.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1165.11  EXISTING FACILITIES UPGRADING.
   Whenever the tract to be subdivided or developed adjoins an existing street,
public facility or utility, which does not meet the City's standard
specifications, the developer may be required to alter and repair the existing
facilities in accordance with the City's current specifications. This may be
necessitated in cases where the new development will place a strain on existing
facilities or in cases where an improvement of existing facilities is necessary
to properly provide services to the new development.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1165.12  GENERAL UTILITY PLACEMENT.
   (a)    The developer shall endeavor to locate all City utilities on one side

Subdivision Regulations and the zoning district requirements for the district
in which they are located and the use for which they are intended.
   (c)    Each lot shall front on a public street. The minimum lot sizes,
widths and setbacks shall be as specified in the City's Zoning Code. For slope
areas where average topographic slope is fifteen percent (15%) or greater,
refer to Chapter
1167.
   (d)    All side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines and
radial to curved street lines, except where Council determines that a variation
to this rule would provide a better layout.
   (e)    Lots with double frontage shall be avoided except where Council
determines that it is essential to provide separation of residential
development from arterial streets.
      (Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1165.15  FLOOD AREAS AND STORM DRAIN DITCHES.
   (a)    In order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the
residents, Council shall reject any proposed subdivision located in an area
subject to periodic flooding. If the subdivision is located in an area having
poor drainage or other adverse physical characteristics, Council may approve
the subdivision provided the subdivider agrees to perform such improvements as
will render the area safe for the intended use. In lieu of improvements, the
subdivider shall furnish a surety or certified check covering the cost of the
required improvements and a written time schedule shall be supplied to the City
by the developer for completion of improvements.
   (b)    Flood control or storm drainage facilities shall be provided as
follows:
Access to flood control or storm drainage ditches and channels shall be by
means of easements. Such easements shall be not less than that needed for a

street shall be designed, if the subdivision design is such that residential
lots would require direct vehicular access onto the arterial highway. Points of
access to the arterial street shall be spaced at a minimum of 1,320 feet. A
planting strip having a minimum width of twenty feet shall be provided between
the pavement of the arterial street and the pavement of the marginal access
street.

developer to serve the subdivisions, and shall be built in accordance with the
Construction Regulations.
   (b)    Minimum Cover.  Minimum cover for storm sewer pipe shall be one foot
clear from the bottom of the curb and gutter or from the bottom of the under
drain to the outside top of the pipe except as approved by the City. Maintain a
minimum of two feet of cover from the finished ground surface to the outside
top of the pipe for any storm sewer system located beyond the limits of the
street right of way.
   (c)    Endwalls.  Standard endwalls are to be constructed at the inlet and
outfall of all storm sewers, and shall be shown on the plan and profile.
   (d)    Erosion Control.  Erosion control shall be provided at the outfall of
all storm sewers and shown on the plan and profile. In addition, measures
approved by the City shall be taken to control erosion during construction.
   (e)    Outfall Elevation.  The invert of the first storm sewer appurtenance
above the computed floodplain elevation.
   (f)    Minimum Size.  Pipe for storm sewers shall not be less than twelve
inches in diameter.
   (g)    Storm Sewer Calculations.  Furnish all drainage calculations,
drainage area outlines, and contributing areas used in drainage design.
   (h)    Inverts at Structures.  The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes,
yard inlets and other appurtenances shall be formed to reduce turbulence to a
minimum.
   (i)    Surface Yard Inlets.  All surface yard inlets shall have convex
castings to prevent the collection of debris.
   (j)    Overland Flow.  The maximum distance for overland flow shall be 300
feet before entering a surface yard inlet or 425 feet before entering a curb
inlet. Except, that the maximum overland drainage area tributary to any yard
inlet or curb inlet shall not exceed one and one-half acres.

through storm drainage systems up to and including the equivalent of a seventy-
two inch inside diameter pipe.
   (m)    Watercourse Easement.  Where an open watercourse is permitted, an
easement shall be provided at least equal to the area required for the twenty-
five year rainfall. Also, the easement shall be shown on the final plat as a
watercourse and utility easement. Restrictions as to the use of this easement
shall be shown on the final plat.
   (n)    Intersection Drainage.  No water will be allowed to cross a street

   (o)    Cleanout Spacing.  A cleanout shall be located no less than every 500
feet on lines where catchbasins are not present in sufficient number.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1165.24  STORM SEWER DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)    Method.  The method outlined herein will provide a general guide as
to the criteria and procedures to be used for storm sewer design.
      (1)    The rational method shall be used for all storm water drainage
design.
         Q = CIA, in which:
         Q = Quantity of storm water runoff in cubic feet per second
         C = Coefficient of runoff (0.4 for R-1 Zoning)
I = Average rainfall intensity in inches per hour for the period of
concentration to the point under consideration
         A = Drainage area in acres tributary to the point of concentration
      (2)    The following rainfall frequency curves shall be used for minimum
design:
         Storm sewer systems - 10-year rainfall
         Open channel flow - 25-year rainfall
         Bridges and culverts - 25-year rainfall without surcharge
         Retention basin - 25-year rainfall based on a hydraulic gradient for 
50-year rainfall (to be used only in extreme cases).
      (3)    Storm sewer pipe sizes are to be determined by using Kutters
Formula with a minimum coefficient of roughness of 13 (n = . 013) for concrete
pipe laid to proper line and grade.
   (b)    Minimum Velocity.  The minimum allowable velocity shall be three feet
per second (fps) in pipe.
   (c)    Maximum Velocity.  The maximum allowable velocity shall be twelve fps
in pipe and seven fps for open channel flow depending on the characteristics of
the channel.
   (d)    Retention Basin.  In event that the existing storm sewer system or
natural drainage area is not sufficient to adequately accommodate additional
water flow from the planned development, the developer may be required to
improve the existing system or if permitted by the City, construct a storm
water retention basin. Retention basins shall be of a design proposed by the
developer and approved by the City.
   (e)    Connections to Storm Sewer System.  All diverted storm water shall
discharge and be connected to the City's storm sewer system, or when permitted
by the City, it may outlet into a natural drainage course, i. e., an existing
creek. Erosion control measures shall be used when outletting into an existing
creek.
   (f)    Subsurface Drainage and Downspouts.  No surface water other than
downspouts, or subsurface water shall be piped or channeled onto any street.
The developer shall be responsible for piping this water into a piped storm
sewer system.
   (g)    Open Ditches Prohibited; Erosion Control.  Open ditches shall not be
constructed within a subdivision. Only existing natural drainage ditches may be
permitted to remain open, or piping of this by the developer may be required.
If a natural drainage area is left open the developer may be required to
construct erosion control measures along the natural drainage area. If erosion
occurs, the developer shall be required to provide erosion control measures to
abate the erosion, after first correcting the damage. Erosion control shall be
supplied at all storm system outfalls by the developer.
   (h)    Overland Erosion Problems.  The developer shall take steps necessary
to control erosion during and after construction. Diversion, straw dikes, rip-
rap, sediment netting and the establishment of proper vegetative cover are
among the items that may be required to control erosion problems.
   (i)    Curbs and Gutters.  Reinforced concrete curbs and gutters shall be
constructed in all subdivisions along streets in accordance with the
Construction Regulations. All curbs and gutters shall connect to an existing
storm sewer system.
   (j)    Culverts.  Culverts shall be installed as necessary. Headwalls are
required at the entrance to all culverts.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1165.25  SANITARY SEWERS.
   (a)    Sanitary Sewer Improvements.  The following requirements shall govern
sewer improvements:
      (1)    Where an adequate public sanitary sewer system is reasonably
accessible, in the determination of Council, public sanitary sewers shall be
installed to adequately serve all lots, including lateral connections to the
public system. Public sewer system extensions shall meet the requirements of
the Construction Regulations, ordinances, resolutions and these Regulations.
Combinations of sanitary sewers and storm sewers shall be prohibited.
      (2)    Where a public sanitary system is not reasonably accessible, the
subdivider may provide:
         A.    A central treatment plant for the group, provided that such
central treatment plant is installed in accordance with State and City
requirements; or
         B.    Lots may be served by individual disposal systems if approved by
the City, the County Health Department and the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency.
      (3)    Where the installation of individual disposal systems is
considered, the suitability of the soil for individual systems, the absorptive
ability of the soil, surface drainage, ground water level, and topography shall
be the criteria for determining whether or not the installation of individual
systems is permissible. Criteria shall be in accordance with the requirements
of the Ohio Department of Health and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
   (b)    Sanitary Sewer Map.  The subdivider shall provide a map delineating
the contributing area in acres to the sanitary sewer system and indicate the
location of the design areas entering the system.
   (c)    Design Criteria.  Sanitary sewers shall be designed in accordance
with the requirements in subsection (e) hereof.
      (1)    The table in subsection (e) hereof is based on a population
density of twelve persons per acre (single-family residential) density, with a
per capita flow of 120 gallons per day (gpd).
      (2)    For area of greater population density than twelve persons per
acre, the design flow shall be determined on a basis of population instead of
area.
      (3)    For areas of greater population density than twelve persons per
acre, a per capita flow of less than 120 gpd may be considered with the
approval of the City.
      (4)    The sanitary sewer design shall be in accordance with the current
edition of the "Ten States - Recommended Standards of Sewage Works" and the
requirements of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA).
      (5)    Each lot so served shall be of a size and shape to accommodate the
necessary length of tile field at a safe distance from and at a lower elevation
than the proposed building(s). Such lot size and shape shall conform to the
requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.
      (6)    At least one percolation test shall be made for each lot area
being platted, and each test shall be located in close proximity to the
proposed individual sewage disposal unit, be numbered and its location shown on
the preliminary plat. All percolation tests shall be performed in accordance
with the requirements of the Director of Public Service, County Health
Department and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
   (d)    Design Data Sheet.  Duplicate copies of the sanitary design data
sheet shall be submitted to the City for approval along with one set of plans
and the signature tracing. The subdivider shall provide the City with all
required Ohio EPA submittals and pay all Ohio EPA review fees.
   Minimum line size shall be eight-inch diameter; minimum depth, thirty-six
inches.
   Lift stations shall be permitted only where gravity sewers are clearly not
practical.
   (e)    Design Basis.  The design basis for sanitary sewers shall be:
      (1)    Twelve persons per acre; and
      (2)    One hundred-twenty gallons per person per day.
      (3)    The above figures are multiplied by a peak flow factor as shown in
the following table.
      (4)    To the peak flow an infiltration allowance of 0.10 cubic feet per
second per 100 acres is added. The resulting figures equal the design flow.
      (5)    0.0001857 x population equals the average flow in cubic feet per
second (cfs).

rear of all lots.
   (b)    Easements.  Easements at least fifteen feet in width centered along
rear or side lot lines shall be provided where necessary for either sanitary
sewers, water lines or electric lines. Easements shall also be provided along
every watercourse, storm sewer, drainage channel or stream. Storm sewer
easement widths are dependent upon line size. A common easement may dictate
greater necessary width.
   (c)    Temporary Electrical Service.  Temporary electrical service shall be
constructed by the City to the development at no cost to the developer, unless
the character of the temporary service construction is so significant that
Council deems it inappropriate to provide such service, or to pay the cost of
providing such service.
   (d)    Permanent Electrical Service.  Generally, the City shall supply the
wire, and the developer shall supply the ditching, conduit, transformers and
pads, labor and equipment, meter base and miscellaneous items necessary to
enable permanent electrical service.
   (e)    Tap-in Fee.  A tap-in fee will be charged to the developer if the
City physically makes connections of the developer's utility system to the
City's utility system. This fee will be as listed with the utility office as
the prevailing fee at the time of the connection. If the developer makes the

developer shall pay the additional cost of the improvement, and may be
reimbursed in part or whole of the cost, through the City's collection and
rebate of future tap-in fees charged to users of the system.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1165.32  EXTENSIONS.
   (a)    To Boundaries.  The subdivider may be required to extend the
necessary improvements to the boundary of the proposed subdivision to serve
adjoining unsubdivided land as determined by Council or grant an easement for
such future extension.
   (b)    Off-Site.  If streets or utilities are not available at the boundary
of a proposed subdivision, the subdivider may be required, prior to approval of
the final plat, to obtain necessary easements or rights of way and construct
and pay for such extensions. Such improvements shall be available for
connections by subdividers of adjoining land.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)

construction cost for the ultimate installation and initial maintenance of the
improvements.
   (b)    The subdivider may deposit in a bank or savings and loan association
in Belmont County, Ohio, the sum not less than the total estimated improvement
cost, to be held in escrow to guarantee the satisfactory completion of such
improvements within the required time, the form of such escrow to be subject to
the approval of the City Law Director and which agreement may provide for the
making of payments from such funds from time to time upon certificates of the
engineer that the balance remaining after such payments will, in his opinion,
be adequate to pay the remaining costs of the improvements.
   (c)    The subdivider may deposit with the City a certified check, in the
amount of the total estimated improvement costs, to be held in escrow until the
satisfactory completion of construction, unless there is a default in the
completion of such improvements, in which event the check may be cashed by the
proper official, and the proceeds thereof used to complete the improvements, to
pay claims connected therewith for which the subdivider may be liable, or to
cure any other default of the subdivider connected with the making of the
improvements.

1167.01  GENERAL.
   These regulations apply to all hillside areas. A hillside area as referred
to herein is defined as one with an average slope of more than fifteen percent
(15%). The subdivider shall submit sufficient detailed information as to
geologic conditions, soil types and underground water level in order that a
determination can be made by the Director of Public Service as to the safety of
development of the particular location.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1167.02  DETERMINATION OF AVERAGE SLOPE.
   The average slope for any hillside development shall be determined by
Council during the time of preliminary subdivision design. Determination will
be on an area-by-area basis with each lot sized according to the average
topographic change falling with each area.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1167.03  GRADING PLAN AND CONTROLS.
   The grading plan shall show contour lines at five-foot intervals where
average slopes exceed ten percent (10%) and at two-foot intervals where slopes
are less than ten percent (10%). Elevations are to be based on the sea level
datum (USGS), if available. The approximate lot layout and the approximate
dimensions shall be shown for each lot and each building site. Where pads are
utilized or proposed for building sites, engineering data shall show the
existing topography and the approximate finishing grades, location and size of
each building site, and finished grade of streets prior to consideration of the
final plat.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1167.04  CUTS AND FILLS.
   No land shall be graded, cut or filled so as to create a slope exceeding a
vertical rise of one foot for each two and one-half feet of horizontal distance
between abutting lots, unless a retaining wall of sufficient height and
thickness is provided to retain the graded bank. Major cuts, excavation,
grading and filling, where the same materially changes the site and its
relationship with surrounding areas or materially affects such areas, shall not
be permitted if such excavation, grading and filling will result in a slope
exceeding a vertical rise of one foot for each two and one- half feet of
horizontal distance between abutting lots or between adjoining tracts of land,
except where adequate provision is made to prevent slides and erosion by
cribbing and retaining walls.
(Ord. 85-11. Passed 4-1-85.)
1167.05  COMPACTION OF FILL.
