   WHEREAS, the Council of the City of Trenton, Ohio, has had the matter of
codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Justinian

   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed, are before
the Council,

to affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provision prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:

publication shall be necessary.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

recorded on the journal of Council. On all matters of general or permanent
nature, or granting a franchise, or levying a tax, or regulating the rate
charged for its services by a public utility, or contracting an indebtedness,
or issuing bonds, or notes, or for the purchase, lease, or transfer of
property, action shall be taken formally, by ordinance in the manner
hereinafter provided. Acts other than those referred to in the preceding
sentence may be done either by ordinance, by resolution, or motion. No action
of the Council shall be invalidated merely because the form of the action does
not comply with the provisions of this section, if it is otherwise valid.
Section 3.02.  Enactment of Ordinances and Resolutions.
   (A)   Ordinances and resolutions may be introduced, in written form, by any
member of Council at a regular or special meeting. Each ordinance and
resolution shall contain only one subject which shall be expressed in its
title; provided that ordinances and resolutions appropriating money may contain
the various subjects, accounts and amounts for which moneys are appropriated,
and ordinances and resolutions which are codified or recodified are not subject
to the limitation of one subject.
   (B)   The enacting clause of each ordinance shall read: 'Be it ordained by
the Council of the City of Trenton, Ohio:' and the enacting clause of each
resolution shall read: 'Be it resolved by the Council of the City of Trenton,
Ohio:'. The action to be taken or the regulation imposed shall be set forth in
the body of the ordinance or resolution.
   (C)   Each ordinance and resolution shall be read in full unless a motion is
passed by a majority vote of the members of Council providing that it be read
by title only. Each ordinance or resolution shall be read on three separate
days, provided that the Council may, by a vote of at least two-thirds of its
members, dispense with the requirement that an ordinance or resolution be read
on three separate days, and authorize the adoption of an ordinance or
resolution upon its first or second reading.
   (D)   No ordinance, resolution, or motion shall be passed without
concurrence of a majority of all members of the Council, except that each
emergency ordinance or resolution shall require the affirmative vote of at
least two-thirds of the members of Council for its enactment, provided that if
such emergency ordinance or resolution shall fail to receive the required two-
thirds affirmative vote, but receives the necessary majority for passage as a
non-emergency ordinance or resolution it shall be considered passed as a non-
emergency ordinance or resolution and shall become effective as hereinafter
provided by this Charter. A majority of the members present at any regular or
special Council meeting may compel the attendance of absent members as provided
in Section 2.06 of this Charter.
   (E)   Each ordinance or resolution shall be authenticated by the signature
of the Mayor and the Clerk of Council; however, the failure or refusal of such
officers to sign such ordinances or resolutions shall not invalidate an
ordinance or resolution.
   (F)   Each ordinance or resolution shall be recorded in a book, or other
record prescribed by the Council, established and maintained for that purpose,
and shall be open for public inspection during regular building hours. The
Clerk of Council or a duly authorized deputy to said Clerk, shall upon the
request of any person and upon the payment of a fee, as established by the
Council, certify true copies of any ordinance or resolution, which certified
copies shall be admissible as evidence in any court.
   (G)   No ordinance or resolution or any section thereof, shall be revised or
amended unless the new ordinance or resolution contains the entire ordinance,
resolution or section or sub-section as revised or amended, and the ordinance,
resolution or section or subsection so amended shall be repealed. This
requirement shall not prevent the amendment of an ordinance or resolution by
the addition of a new section, sections, sub-section or sub-sections and in
such case the full text of the former ordinance or resolution need not be set
forth; nor shall this section prevent repeals by implication. Except in the
case of a codification or recodification of ordinances and resolutions, a
separate vote shall be taken on each ordinance or resolution proposed to be
amended. Ordinances and resolutions that have been introduced and have received
their first reading, their first and second reading, or their first, second and
third reading, but have not been voted on as to passage, may be amended or
revised upon approval by a majority vote of the members of Council and such
amended or revised ordinance or resolution need not receive additional
readings.

or at such later date as may be provided therein. All other ordinances and

made effective at once or in less than thirty (30) days to meet an emergency in
the operation of the City government, or which is necessary for the immediate
preservation of the public peace, health, safety, or welfare. Each emergency
ordinance or resolution must contain therein a separate section setting forth
the reason for the emergency. No ordinance or resolution granting a franchise,
or for zoning, or fixing a rate to be charged for a public utility shall be
passed as an emergency measure.
Section 3.04.  Publication of Ordinances.
   All ordinances and resolutions of a general nature shall be posted on the
City web site, and copies displayed at Civic Hall and the Public Library. Such
summary shall consist of a brief statement of the effect of the ordinance or
resolution. After passage, ordinances, and resolutions, shall be posted in at
least two places in the City, one of which shall be the Municipal Building, not
less than ten (10) days prior to the taking effect thereof. An emergency
ordinance or resolution shall also be published and posted as aforesaid, but
said requirement shall not postpone the immediate taking effect thereof. A
failure to post or to publish, omission, delay or error in said posting or
publication on the part of the City or a newspaper, their officers, employees
or agents, shall not cause such ordinance or resolution to be declared invalid,
or otherwise affect the validity of such ordinance or resolution, and in such
events the Clerk of Council shall authorize posting or publication at a later
date.

departs from the written recommendations of the Planning Commission shall take
effect unless passed and approved by a vote of not less than two-thirds of the

with the written recommendations of the Planning Commission shall be deemed to
pass or take effect without the concurrence of at least a majority of the
members elected to the Council.

hearing on each ordinance or resolution establishing, amending, revising,
changing or repealing zoning classifications, districts, uses, or regulations,
which hearing shall be after the thirty day period provided in Division (A) of
this Section within which the Planning Commission is required to return its
written recommendations to the Clerk of Council. The Clerk of Council shall
cause a notice of such public hearing posted on the City web site, and copies
displayed at Civic Hall and the Public Library within the City at least fifteen
days prior to the date of such public hearing, and when such amendment,
revision, change or repeal involves ten or less parcels of land, as listed on
the tax duplicate, written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by first class
mail by the Clerk of Council at least ten days before the date of the public
hearing to the owners of property within, contiguous to and within two hundred
feet from such parcel or parcels to the addresses of such owners appearing on
the County Auditor's current tax list or the Treasurer's mailing list as such
lists appear fifteen days prior to the date of the public hearing. If the
mailing address of any such owner cannot be reasonably determined from such
lists, only the newspaper notice shall be required as to such owners. The
failure of delivery of such notice shall not invalidate any such ordinance or
resolution.

standard ordinance or code shall make reference to the date and source of such
standard ordinance or code without reproducing the same at length in the
ordinance. In such cases, publication of the standard ordinance or code shall
not be required, but one copy of such code shall be kept at all times in the
office of the Clerk of Council and available for reference by interested
persons. If the standard ordinance or code, after its adoption by reference by
the Council, is amended, the Council may adopt the amendment or change by
incorporation by reference in an ordinance under the same procedure as is
established herein for the adoption of the original standard ordinance or code
without the necessity of setting forth in full in the ordinance the provisions
either of the amendment or change to the original ordinance or the standard
ordinance or code.

the members of Council, and may contain new matter therein. The Clerk of
Council shall cause a notice of such proposed revision, codification,

CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a State legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.

the criteria in division (a) above, ordinarily culminating in the
recommendation of the best responsible quote, which may also be, but does not

statutory procedures for the selection of these providers.  Competitive bidding
requirements may be waived in the case of a sole source provider, or in the
case of utilization of the State bidding process.

requirements, but shall require City Council approval by motion, if over thirty
thousand dollars ($30,000).  The City Manager, whenever practicable, shall
obtain three or more formal quotations, based upon a request for qualifications
(RFQ) for professional services contracts, to reasonably assure that the City
is paying a fair price for the most qualified expert professional services.

based upon a thorough review of formal or informal RFQs, ordinarily culminating
in the recommendation of the best responsible quote, which may also be, but

lieu of any statutory procedures for the selection of professional service
providers.  Competitive bidding requirements may be waived in the case of a
sole source provider.
   (e)   City Council’s review of proposed contracts shall include
consideration of a recommendation by the City Manager. The City reserves the
right to waive defects in bids or proposals where such waiver is in the City’s
interest, and to reject any and all bids or proposals. Further, the City
Council may require formal bidding requirements be followed prior to,
concurrent with, or upon consideration of any contract described in division
(a) or (b) above, upon the affirmative vote of a Council motion by a majority
of the members present.

   (g)   Additionally, the Treasurer or Treasurer's designee must file an

   (h)   General rules.
      (1)   “Purchasing card account” means any bank issued credit card
account, store issued credit card account, financial institution issued credit
card account, financial depository issued credit card account, or any other
card or credit account allowing the holder to purchase goods or services on
credit or to transact with the account, and any debit or gift card account
related to the receipt of grant moneys.
      (2)   Purchasing card accounts include online purchasing accounts (e.g.
Amazon Business which include the ability to set internal controls over
employee spending), and store gift cards (not related to the receipt of grant
monies). Store gift cards are credit cards which are preloaded with a set
dollar amount and may be used only at a specific retailer.
      (3)   In addition to the cardholder name, the name "City of Trenton" must
appear on all purchasing cards.
      (4)   The City of Trenton may not hold or utilize a debit card account.
Debit card account means a card account issued by a financial institution which
allows the holder to transfer money electronically to another bank account when
making a transaction. A debit card account includes the following:
         A.   A single-use cash gift card (not related to the receipt of grant
monies). A cash gift card is a debit card account with a set dollar amount and
may be accepted by any retailer, similar to a debit card. The cash gift card is
void upon spending the balance or expiration.
         B.   A prepaid gift card (not related to the receipt of grant monies).
A prepaid gift card is a debit card account that is reloadable, unlike the cash
gift card.
      (5)   "Purchasing card account" does not include the following:
         A.   “Procurement card account.” A card issued to designated users by
a political subdivision to make purchases at selected businesses. Procurement
cards can be tied to either a credit card or bank account. Security measures
for procurement cards include setting per-purchase and per-month dollar limits.
Procurement cards may also feature spending restrictions for the types of
purchases allowed and merchant category codes which define where purchases can
and cannot be made. This differs from a Purchasing card because use can be
limited to specific businesses and dollar amounts.
         B.   “Gasoline card.” A card utilized strictly for fuel and automotive
parts or repairs purchases.
         C.   “Telephone credit card account.” An account utilized to enable
users to make long distance phone calls.
         D.   Any other card account, similar to a gasoline or telephone card,
where a merchant category code limiting the type of goods that may be purchased
is in place as a system of control for use of the card account.
      (6)   An officer or employee of the City of Trenton who knowingly misuses
a purchasing card account violates § 2913.21 of the Ohio Revised Code, which is
a misdemeanor of the first degree. Misuse of a purchasing card may result in
personal liability for an illegitimate charge and may be cause for the employee
to forfeit the purchasing card.

the safety and soundness of the City from identity theft, including financial,
operational, compliance, reputation or litigation risks.
   (b)   “Identifying information.”  Information that may be used alone or in

   (a)   City personnel are to use common sense judgment in securing sensitive
information to the proper extent.  File cabinets, desk drawers, overhead
cabinets, and any other storage space containing documents with sensitive
information will be secured when not in use. Storage rooms containing documents
with sensitive information and record retention areas will be locked at the end
of each workday or when unsupervised. Desks, workstations, work areas, printers
and fax machines, and common shared work areas should be cleared of all
documents containing sensitive information when not in use.

   Six agencies were involved in drafting the red flag rules: The Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervision, The Office of Comptroller of the
Currency, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, The Federal Trade
Commission, The National Credit Union Administration, and The Federal Reserve
System.  The City hereby determines that the following are the relevant red
flags for purposes of this program, given the relative size of the City and the

the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or customer, such as:
  a recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries; an unusual
number of recently established credit relationships; a material change in the
use of credit, especially with respect to recently established credit

of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
   (f)   Documents provided for identification that appear to have been altered
or forged.
   (g)   Photograph or physical description on the identification is not

fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the
City. For example, the address or phone number on an application is the same as
the address or phone number provided on a fraudulent application.
   (l)   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the City.  For example: the address on an application is
fictitious, a mail drop, or a prison; or the phone number is invalid or is

personal identifying information that is on file with the City.
   (q)   When using security questions (mother's maiden name, pet's name,

account, the City receives a request for new, additional, or replacement goods
or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the account.
   (s)   A new account is used in a manner commonly associated with known fraud
patterns. For example, the customer fails to make the first payment or makes an
initial payment but no subsequent payments.

established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example
nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments.

modification of or access to existing accounts and the detection of any red
flags that might arise. 
   (b)   Management shall see to it that all employees who might be called upon
to assist a customer with the opening of a new account or with modifying or
otherwise accessing an existing account are properly trained such that they
have a working familiarity with the relevant red flags identified in this
program so as to be able to recognize any red flags that might surface in
connection with the transaction. 
   (c)   An employee who is not sufficiently trained to recognize the red flags
identified in this program shall not open a new account for any customer,
modify any existing account or otherwise provide any customer with access to
information in an existing account without the direct supervision and specific
approval of a management employee.
   (d)   Management employees shall be properly trained such that they can
recognize the relevant red flags identified in this program and exercise sound
judgment in connection with the response to any unresolved red flags that may
present themselves in connection with the opening of a new account or with
modifying or accessing of an existing account.  Management employees shall be
responsible for making the final decision on any such unresolved red flags.
   (e)   The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a written
policy setting forth the manner in which a prospective new customer may apply
for service, the information and documentation to be provided by the
prospective customer in connection with an application for a new utility
service account, the steps to be taken by the employee assisting the customer
with the application in verifying the customer's identity and the manner in
which the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-
party service provider shall be maintained.
   (f)    Such policy shall be generally consistent with the spirit of the
Customer Identification Program rules of the USA Patriot Act but need not be as
detailed.  The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a
written policy setting forth the manner in which customers with accounts shall
establish their identity before being allowed to make modifications to or
otherwise gain access to existing accounts.
(Res. 05-2009.  Passed 4-2-09.)
209.06  RESPONDING TO RED FLAGS.
   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, (a red flag is identified)
an employee must act quickly as a rapid appropriate response can protect
customers and the City from damages and loss. Once potentially fraudulent
activity is detected, the employee is to gather all related documentation and
write a description of the situation and present this information to the
Program Coordinator, who will then complete additional authentication to
determine the appropriate response.
(Res. 05-2009.  Passed 4-2-09.)
209.07  APPROPRIATE RESPONSES FOR SUSPECTED FRAUD.
   An appropriate response for suspected fraudulent activity may include:
   (a)   Further monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft;
   (b)   Contacting the customer;
   (c)   Changing any passwords, security codes or other security devices that
permit access to a covered account;
   (d)   Reopening a covered account with a new account number;
   (e)   Not opening a new covered account;
   (f)   Closing an existing covered account;
   (g)   Notifying law enforcement; or
   (h)   Determining no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances.
(Res. 05-2009.  Passed 4-2-09.)
209.08  APPROPRIATE RESPONSES FOR FRAUDULENT ACTIONS.
   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate actions must be
taken immediately. Actions may include:
   (a)   Canceling the transaction;
   (b)   Notifying and cooperating with appropriate law enforcement;
   (c)   Determining the extent of liability of the City; and
   (d)   Notifying the actual customer that fraud has been attempted.
(Res. 05-2009.  Passed 4-2-09.)
209.09  DUTIES REGARDING ADDRESS DISCREPANCIES.
   In the event the City uses a consumer report and receives a notice from a
consumer reporting agency of an address discrepancy, the appropriate employee
shall establish that the consumer report relates to the consumer about whom the
City has requested the consumer report. This may be done by: verification of
the address with the consumer; review of the utility's records; verification of
the address through third-party sources; or other reasonable means.
(Res. 05-2009.  Passed 4-2-09.)
209.10  UPDATING PROGRAM.
   This program shall be updated periodically to reflect changes in risks to
customers or to the safety and soundness of the organization from identity
theft based on factors such as: the experiences of the organization with
identity theft; changes in methods of identity theft; changes in methods to
detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft; changes in the types of accounts
that the organization offers or maintains; changes in the business arrangements
of the organization, including mergers, acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures
and service provider arrangements.
(Res. 05-2009.  Passed 4-2-09.)
209.11  OVERSIGHT OF PROGRAM.
   The Program Coordinator shall oversee and take steps to ensure that this
program is being followed. Oversight of this program shall include: assignment
of specific responsibility for implementation of this program; review of
reports prepared by staff regarding compliance; and approval of material
changes to this program as necessary to address changing risks of identity
theft. The reports by staff shall address material matters related to the
program and evaluate issues such as: the effectiveness of the program in
addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered
accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; significant incidents
involving identity theft and the City's response; and recommendations for
material changes to the program. The Program Coordinator shall train staff, as
necessary, to effectively implement the program. The Program Coordinator shall
also oversee any service provider arrangements in the event the City engages a
service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more covered
accounts to assure that the activity of the service provider is conducted in
accordance with this program and any reasonable policies and procedures
designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft.
(Res. 05-2009.  Passed 4-2-09.)
209.12  RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   The initial adoption and approval of the Identity Theft Prevention
Program shall be by Resolution adopted by the City Council.  Thereafter,
changes to the program of a day-to-day operational character and decisions
relating to the interpretation and implementation of the program may be made by
the Identity Theft Prevention Program Committee.  Major changes or shifts of
policy positions under the program shall only be made with the approval of the
City Manager.
   (b)   Development, implementation, administration, and oversight of the
program will be the responsibility of the Program Administrator.  The Program
Administrator may, but shall not be required to, appoint a committee to
administer the program.  The Program Administrator shall be the head of any
such committee.  The Program Administrator will report at least annually to the
City Manager regarding compliance with this program.

      (1)   Roll call. The Mayor shall take the chair at the hour appointed for
Council to meet and shall immediately call the members to order. The roll shall

of a roll call vote, the Chair shall declare the result after the Clerk has
announced the number voting on each side. The results of viva voce votes shall
be declared by the Chair without reference to the Clerk. Where the result of a
viva voce vote is in doubt, the Chair may, and on demand of any member shall,
call for a division of Council, which shall be taken by a roll call.  It shall
not be in order for members to explain their votes during the call of the roll.
      (5)   Presiding officer - leaving Chair. The presiding officer at a
meeting may call any other member to take his place in the Chair, but the
substitution shall not extend beyond adjournment. "Presiding officer" means
either the Mayor, Vice-Mayor or Chairman of the meeting.
      (6)   Addressing Chair. Every member speaking to a question or making a
motion, shall address the Chair as "Mr. Mayor," who shall thereupon pronounce
the name of the member entitled to the floor. Members addressing Council shall
confine themselves to the question under debate and avoid personal references
to other members or members of the City administration.
      (7)   Division of a question. Upon demand of any member, a question under
consideration covering two or more points shall be divided where the question
admits of such division.
      (8)   Demand for roll call. Upon demand of any member made before the
vote has been recorded, the roll shall be called for yeas and nays upon any
question before Council. A demand for roll call cannot be made by a member
until each member has had an opportunity to speak twice on the question.
      (9)   Personal privilege. The right of a member to address Council on a
question of personal privilege shall be limited to cases in which his
integrity, character or motives are assailed, questioned or impugned.
      (10)   Dissents and protests. Any member shall have the liberty to
dissent from or protest against any Council ordinance, resolution or other
decision, and have the reason or reasons thereof entered upon the Journal. Such

of such ordinance, resolution or decision.
      (11)   Caucus meetings and executive meetings. No private caucus or
executive meeting shall be called during a recess of the regular Council
meeting, without the two-thirds vote of Council. No private caucus or executive
meeting shall be called except for those purposes specified in R.C. § 121.22
(G).
      (12)   Motions.
         A.   Order of precedence. When a question is before Council, the
following order of precedence is hereby established:
            1.   To adjourn;
            2.   To lay on the table;
            3.   The previous question;
            4.   To postpone to a time certain;
            5.   To refer;
            6.   To amend; and
            7.   To postpone indefinitely.
         B.   Motion to adjourn. A motion to adjourn is in order at any time,
except as follows:
            1.   When repeated without intervening business or discussion;
            2.   When made while another member is speaking;
            3.   When the previous question has been ordered; and
            4.   While a vote is being taken.
               The presiding officer cannot summarily adjourn a meeting.
Regular adjournment must be authorized by Council. In the case of regular
adjournment, the meeting is ended and no further action can be taken at such
meeting. When it is necessary to continue the unfinished business of a meeting
at another time, Council may authorize an adjourned meeting, but the motion
must state the specific time of the adjourned meeting.
         C.   Motion to lay on the table. A motion to lay on the table
precludes all amendments or debate of the subject under consideration. If the
motion prevails, consideration of the subject can be resumed only upon motion
of a member voting with the majority, and with the consent of a majority of the
members present.
         D.   Previous question. The previous question is a motion to close
debate. After a motion moving the previous question is made and carried, the
presiding officer puts the question: "Shall debate now close?"
         E.   Motion to amend. A motion to amend shall undertake but one
amendment. An amendment once rejected may not be moved again in the same form.
         F.   Postponement. A motion for postponement may be amended as to
time, excepting a motion to postpone indefinitely. When a motion to postpone
indefinitely is carried, the question is declared to be lost.
      (13)   Reconsideration. Any member who voted with the prevailing side of
a question may move a reconsideration at any time, and a motion to reconsider,
once put and lost, shall not be renewed. This is a privileged motion and takes
precedence over all other questions and may be considered at any time after
pending business is disposed of. A majority of those present may reconsider any
vote, except that by which an ordinance or resolution was passed, which shall
require not less than four votes. No resolution or ordinance shall be
reconsidered after one regular meeting has intervened after its passage.
      (14)   Other rules. Robert's Rules of Order, Revised Edition, shall be
used to cover all points of parliamentary procedure not covered by the
foregoing rules of procedure.

redeemable, whether subject to check or not. Whenever there are moneys in the
City Treasury which will not be required to be used for six months or more,
such moneys may, in lieu of being deposited in a bank or domestic savings and
loan association, be invested in certificates of deposit issued by any bank or
domestic savings and loan association with which the City has a depository
agreement, and in such bonds or other obligations as are specified by State

222.18  FUND CASH BALANCE POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this policy is to take a proactive approach
to financial management in the City.  A Fund Cash Balance Policy assists the
City in maintaining the security of major operating funds and contributes to
the financial stability of the City by maintaining adequate financial
reserves.  More importantly, a fund cash balance policy allows for the
administration and City Council to recognize warning indicators of financial
stress at an early date.  This is to serve as an operating tool to manage fund
cash balances on an on-going basis.  This policy is cash basis only, and should
not be construed to displace or supersede the provisions of GASB 54 or GAAP
reporting requirements.
   (b)   Policy.  There is hereby established a policy for the maintenance and
use of unencumbered cash reserves in certain major funds for the purpose of
financial stability and to back up future repayment of debt.  This is intended
to create a framework from which to make ongoing financial decisions.  The
monthly actual cash balance within the monthly statement of cash position
report to Council will be reported to determine if minimum fund cash balances
as stated herein are being maintained or achieved.  If the cash balance falls
below the minimum fund cash balance as stated herein, expenditures and/or
annual appropriations shall be adjusted to ensure that the cash balance will be
restored as described in the scope of this policy or denoted as to the reason
for the waiver from the policy.  The denoted reason should contain a plan with
timelines for how the minimum fund cash balance will be restored.  The fund
cash balance policy will ensure that the City maintains adequate cash balance/
retained earnings and reserves in its various operating funds to provide the
capacity to:
      (1)   Provide sufficient cash flow for daily financial needs.
      (2)   Secure and maintain investment grade bond ratings.
      (3)   Offset significant economic downturns or revenue shortfalls.
      (4)   Provide funds for unforeseen expenditures related to emergencies.
      (5)   Maintain a prudent level of financial resources to protect against
reducing services or raising taxes and fees due to temporary shortfalls or
unexpected one-time expenditures.
   (c)   Definitions.  The following words or phrases are defined so as to make
this policy more easily understandable:
      (1)   "Annual appropriations."  The appropriations as prepared annually
during the budgetary process and approved by Council through legislation.
      (2)   "Cash balance."  The unencumbered fund balance, or cash, prior to
consideration of encumbrances.
      (3)   "Encumbrances."  The cumulative amount of purchase orders
outstanding within a fund.  An encumbrance represents a draw down upon an
existing appropriation to the point of limiting expenditures within a fund
without exceeding those appropriations.
      (4)   "Fund balance."  The amount of cash available in a fund net of
encumbrances.
      (5)   "Operating expenses."  All expenditures less capital expenditures
and transfers.
   (d)   Scope.
      (1)   The Administration and Council shall attempt to maintain a cash
balance in the following Funds as described below.
         A.   (011) General Fund-Five months operating expenses of the most
recent prior year.
         B.   (250) General Fund Stabilization Fund-Ten percent (10%) of most
recent annual General Fund appropriations.
         C.   (026) Water Fund-Six months operating expenses of the most recent
prior year.
         D.   (066) Sewer Fund-Six months operating expenses of the most recent
prior year.
         E.   (096) Refuse Fund-Three months operating expenses of the most
recent prior year.
         F.   (102) Street Fund-Annual operating expenses of the most recent
prior year.
         G.   (166) Storm Water Fund-Six months operating expenses of the most
recent prior year.
         H.   (222) Fire Fund-Six months operating expenses of the most recent
prior year.
         I.   (890) Employee Termination Benefits Fund-Calculate projected
payouts to employees eligible for payments as calculated annually for and
stipulated in the Notes to the Basic Financial Statements Compensated Absences
Payable due within one year.
      (2)   Funds which are subject to bond indenture covenants will be
required to comply with those covenants, and the terms of those covenants which
direct corrective action when a fund falls below its compliance level.
      (3)   All other funds not mentioned above are considered minor funds and
are not required to maintain a minimum fund cash balance under this policy.
   (e)   Monitoring and Reporting.  Fund cash balances will be monitored on a
month to month basis and the Treasurer will prepare a monthly report to Council
identifying these funds listed herein with policy implications.  A cash balance
may fall below minimum levels due to current operations or emergencies. 
However, non-compliant funds will be identified, corrective action recommended,
and action steps taken to restore the fund cash balance to compliance.
   (f)   No Negative Fund Cash Balances.  As stated above, certain funds of the
City have no fund cash balance requirement under this policy.  However, it is
the intent of the City not to have negative fund cash balances, either
projected or actual.  Should a fund anticipate a negative fund cash balance, or
actually go negative, appropriation or expenditure adjustment or transfer in of
revenue shall be made to insure that the fund cash balance is restored to zero
or greater than zero.
(Ord. 18-2013.  Passed 8-15-13.)
222.19   BICENTENNIAL FUND.

invoiced for all emergency medical transports by the Trenton Fire Department
(TFD).  Said invoicing shall be according to the usual, reasonable and
customary charges at the most current prevailing for the service area, at the
highest and most appropriate rate allowed by the proper authority.  Said
charges shall also consider the actual costs of providing 911 services for all
basic life support services (BLS); advanced life support services (ALS 1 and

provision does not prohibit the City or its representatives from invoicing the

   (a)   The City Charter specifically adopts, as its guiding principle, merit
as the basis for appointment or hiring. It is the intent of the Charter and the
City personnel policy that each City employee be selected, paid and promoted on
the basis of merit. The personnel policy of the City is intended to be so
designed as to attract and keep good people in the employment of the City. It
is intended that this policy shall assure that an employee shall be paid
according to his or her contribution to the City and that his or her efforts on
behalf of the City shall reflect value to the City commensurate with his pay.
This policy implements the concept of merit and recognition of individual merit
by incentive pay plans and promotion.
   (b)   Employment applications are designed for the purpose of hiring the
most qualified applicant. City employees shall have an opportunity to apply for
any new position and may compete equally with all applicants. Positions,
whether new or promotional shall be filled on the basis of competitive
examination without regard to race, religion, sex or national origin. Mandatory
checks shall be made of employment and character references. Examination format
shall be determined by the City Manager.

difficulty and such other elements as are consistent in measuring the job's
worth to the City.
   (b)   The City Council shall approve each job classification and its
associated pay grade, which shall consist of six incremental steps within that
pay grade. Generally, employees shall be hired at the lowest step. However, the
City Manager, at his or her sole discretion, may hire at any step in
recognition of extensive experience and qualifications. Employees shall, upon
satisfactory rating on his or her annual performance evaluation, be compensated
the next incremental step increase, solely on the basis of merit step in any
twelve month period unless authorized by the City Manager. Longevity provisions
shall be in addition to the steps as outlined herein.
(Ord. 34-2002.  Passed 12-5-02; Ord. 09-2016.  Passed 11-17-16.)

without appeal during this period.
(Ord. 920.  Passed 10-19-72; Ord. 09-2016.  Passed 11-17-16.)
250.06  PERFORMANCE REVIEW.
   The department head shall perform annual performance reviews once a year no
later than one month prior to the employee's anniversary date for the purpose
of evaluating individual performance and examining qualifications for merit
step increases.  Each department head shall conduct such an interview with each
employee and complete a performance evaluation report to the City Manager
detailing strengths, progress, deficiencies, challenges for improvement, a
summary of overall performance of the employee, and a recommendation as to
whether a merit increase is justified. The City Manager shall endorse, amend,
or return for further explanation all performance evaluations. A merit increase
shall be limited to one step per year, unless the employee is at the top step
and, further, only if the employee receives a "Satisfactory" or better
performance rating.  An employee shall not receive any merit increase if he or
she receives a performance rating of "Needs Improvement".  An employee may
receive a merit decrease of one step if he or she receives a performance rating
of "Unsatisfactory".  The process outlined in Section
250.15 shall be followed prior to any decision to assess a merit decrease.

      (1)   Full-time employees.
         A.   Each full-time employee shall be credited with sick leave of
eighty hours per year.  Such credit shall be made to each employee in active
pay status beginning the first day of the base pay period.
         B.   A full-time employee in no pay status as of the beginning of the
base pay period shall be credited with sick leave of eighty hours per year,
less one and one-half hours for each pay period that has elapsed following the
base pay period, up until the first day of the pay period during which the
employee returns to active pay status.
         C.   A newly appointed full-time employee shall be credited with sick
leave of eighty hours per year, less one and one-half hours for each pay period
that has elapsed following the base pay period, up until the first day of the
pay period during which the appointment is effective.
         D.   A full-time employee who is separated from service or is no
longer a full-time employee during the year shall receive a reduction of sick
leave credit of one and one- half hours for each pay period that remains,
beginning with the first pay period following the date of separation until the
pay period preceding the next base pay period.  If the reduction results in a
number of hours less than zero, the cash equivalent value of such number of
hours shall be deducted from any compensation that remains payable to the
employee, from the cash conversion value of any vacation or personal leave that
remains credited to the employee or from any sick leave accumulated that
remains credited to the employee.
      (2)   Non full-time employees.  An employee who is not a full-time
employee shall not receive sick leave credit.
   (b)   Charge of Sick Leave.  Sick leave used by an employee shall be charged
in minimum units of one-quarter hour.  Employees shall be charged sick leave
only for the days and hours for which they would have otherwise been regularly
scheduled to work.  Sick leave may not exceed the amount of time an employee
would have been regularly scheduled to work in any pay period.  If sick leave
is utilized in the regularly scheduled work week, the employee cannot receive
overtime pay for the same hours used in sick leave unless otherwise determined
by the department head and the City Manager.
   (c)   Compensation for Charged Sick Leave.  Sick leave for an employee which
is credited during or subsequent to the base pay period shall be exhausted
before the use of sick leave accumulated prior to the base pay period is
allowed.  Compensation for charged sick leave shall be at a rate equal to the
employee’s hourly base rate of pay.
   (d)   Notification.
      (1)   An employee who is unable to report for work shall notify his or
her immediate supervisor that he or she is unable to report for work. The
notification must be made at least one hour prior to the time that the employee
is scheduled to report for work, unless emergency conditions prevent such
notification. If operational need of a department requires a different
notification time, the department head, with the approval of the City Manager,
may establish a reasonable notification time requirement.  The department head
shall inform all employees of the applicable notification policy.
      (2)   Physicians statement.  The department head may require, at any
time, an employee to furnish an affidavit from a qualified physician noting
that a reported illness or injury justified use of sick leave and was severe
enough to cause an employee to miss work, and documenting specifically the
type, diagnosis and remedy within HIPAA Guidelines and clearing the employee to
return to work.  The department head shall require the above information in the
case of a condition exceeding three consecutive calendar days.  Further, in all
cases where medicine has been prescribed which may cause significant side
effects, such as but not limited to the impairment of an employee’s ability to
operate a vehicle, the employee shall submit the appropriate documentation from
the appropriate and qualified medical professional for inclusion in the
employee’s confidential medical file.  Falsification of either the signed
statement or a physician’s certificate shall be grounds for disciplinary
action, which may include dismissal.

or hospitalization is required, the employee shall notify his or her immediate
supervisor upon admission to and discharge from such institution or hospital,
unless emergency conditions prevent such notification.  A physician’s statement

required, the employee shall notify his or her immediate supervisor at the
start and termination of such period of convalescence.  A physician’s statement
shall be required, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) hereof, as soon as reasonably
possible but no later than just prior to the employee’s return to work.
   (e)   Uses. Employees may use sick leave, provided that a credit balance is
available, upon approval of the department head, for the following reasons:
      (1)   Illness, injury or pregnancy-related condition of the employee;
      (2)   Exposure of an employee to a contagious disease which could be
communicated to and jeopardize the health of other employees;
      (3)   Examinations of the employee, including medical, psychological,
dental or optical, by an appropriate practitioner;
      (4)   Illness, injury or a pregnancy-related condition of a member of the
employee’s immediate family where the employee’s presence is reasonably
necessary for the health and welfare of the employee or affected family member;
or
      (5)   Examinations, including medical, psychological, dental or optical,
of a member of the employee’s immediate family by an appropriate practitioner
where the employee’s presence is reasonably necessary.
   (f)   Abuse.  An employee who fails to comply with this section shall not be
allowed to use sick leave for time absent from work under such noncompliance. 
An application for the use of sick leave with the intent to defraud shall be
grounds for disciplinary action which may include dismissal.
   (g)   Inadequate Sick Leave.
      (1)   Leaves of absence. If any disabling illness or injury continues
past the time for which an employee has accumulated sick leave, the City
Manager may authorize a leave of absence without pay in accordance with
administrative regulations.

leave or vacation leave and faces the prospect of leave of absence without pay,
fellow employees may voluntarily “pool” portions of their accumulated sick
leave and donate it to an employee with the special permission of the City
Manager.
   (h)   Prior Credit.  An employee hired into the City service shall be given
credit for accrued but unused sick leave earned by the employee at a previous
place of employment with the State or any of its subdivisions, up to the limits
allowed by the Ohio Revised Code.

      (3)   All sick leave credit balances that are carried forward are
excluded from further cash benefits under this section. The failure of an

TITLE TEN - Judicial
         
Chap. 280.   Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 280
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Trenton has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Trenton ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving moving
traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the corporate
limits of Trenton, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and 2938.04.
In keeping his docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed by the laws
pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him, waives a jury and
consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such event, does
not waive his right to a jury trial, then the magistrate shall require the
accused to enter into recognizance to appear before a court of record in Butler
County, and the magistrate shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together
with a transcript of proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such
recognizance, if given, to the court of record.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to a trial by jury
shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with
the clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set
for trial, whichever is later. Criminal Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of
Criminal Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides
that right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing
therefor and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days
prior to the date set for trial, or on or before the third day following
receipt of notice of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to
claim jury trial as provided herein is a complete waiver of right thereto. Jury
trial may not be had in courts not of record, but failure to waive a jury in
writing where the right to a jury trial may be asserted shall require the
magistrate to certify such case to a court of record as provided in Ohio R.C.
2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Trenton ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas," the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, styled as the "Ohio Traffic Rules," became effective on January 1, 1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section 434.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in

citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the

violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of
time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for

414.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.  Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence
districts, the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. 
Where two or more through highways designated under this division intersect and
no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
414.04  SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow.  A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow.  A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

414.05  PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

or (a)(2) and a violation of division (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, but
the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of these divisions.
   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, "emergency medical
technician-intermediate" and "emergency medical technician-paramedic" have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.  If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section.  The person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense.  The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person.  The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), "emergency medical technician-
intermediate" and "emergency medical technician-paramedic" have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))

      (1)   Definitions.  As used in this section:
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device” means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section.  The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness.  Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who  otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person
if convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)
(c), (d), or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.

made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. 
The person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request
of the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.,
O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under
State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest
for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face
increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person’s license or permit or it is not in the person’s vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person’s initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that

the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,

during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet

responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under division
(c)(3)C.  of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court, neither

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.

violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a

division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff's failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
Ohio R.C. 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

   (b)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.

such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
state route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and

Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating "no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons" or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit.  Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.

   (a)   The County Sheriff or Chief of Police, within the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
respective territorial jurisdiction, or a State highway patrol trooper, upon
notification to the Sheriff or Chief of Police of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or
state highway patrol trooper as a result of the performance of the Sheriff’s,
Chief’s, or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Sheriff
or Chief of Police of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
However, when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may
be ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;

Chief of Police, or State highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered
removed.

of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the identity of the
owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the Sheriff

days of the removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Sheriff
or Chief of Police shall send or cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at
the owner’s or lienholder’s last known address by certified mail with return
receipt requested, notice that informs the owner or lienholder that the motor
vehicle will be declared a nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten
days of the date of mailing of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal

retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

search of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles has been conducted and
after notice has been sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this
section, and the search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice
was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or
lienholder shall pay to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), in addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the
removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of mailing of the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police,
without charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county
in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with
the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the
Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Sheriff or Chief of Police. If the
vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other
facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police shall execute in triplicate
an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and that all
requirements of this section have been complied with. The Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or
other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor
vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.

Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor

   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to

conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.

negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.

to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

the offense either by an aggrieved person or by the aggrieved person's legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.
      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a
party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)
(3) of this section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the
following offenses during the following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years

         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this division:
         A.   The phrase “offense is directly related to the misconduct in
office of a public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A),
2921.43(A) or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense
involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03
is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and
if the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined
to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time
of the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused departed this
Municipality or conceals the accused’s identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal which commenced the prosecution is quashed or
the proceedings thereon are set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section apply to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015,
and apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to July
16, 2015, if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section
as it existed on July 15, 2015.
(ORC 2901.13)
606.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in Ohio R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.”  Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.”  Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.”  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.”  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.09  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)

commission of a theft offense.
      (10)   The statement is knowingly made to a probate court in connection

      (12)   The statement is made in connection with the purchase of a

R.C. 2923.1213.

with the person’s purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery
sale.
   (b)   No person, in connection with the purchase of a firearm as defined in

   (c)   No person, in an attempt to obtain a concealed handgun license under

drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a hospital,
clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider whose alcohol
and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.36.

actor in the course of his or her duties in connection with a bona fide program
for providing counseling services to victims of crimes that are violations of
Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.05, or to victims of felonious sexual penetration in

services" include services provided in an informal setting by a person who, by

any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.
   (i)   Whoever violates division (a) or (b) of this section is guilty of

      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.

reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as

receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog

attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
618.17 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and

      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer's regular duties, and giving an outline of
the signer's education, training, and experience for performing an analysis of
materials included under this section.  The signer shall attest that
scientifically accepted tests were performed with due caution, and that the

report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,

substances that are, the basis of the alleged violation preserved for the
benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst employed by

analyst appointed by the court.  Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused's analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances.  The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial.  If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused's analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused's attorney.  In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused's privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the
analysis.

multiple thereof, or who is accused of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, other than a minor misdemeanor
violation, that involves marihuana, is entitled, upon written request made to
the prosecuting attorney, to have a laboratory analyst of the accused's choice,
or, if the accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the
court, present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis
of the alleged violation.  Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

the basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests

specified on its license or if a charitable organization wants to conduct bingo
sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than the day or time specified
on its license, the charitable organization may apply in writing to the
Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2915.08(F).  A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than
the day or time specified on its license. If the amended license is granted,

offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.

2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who
is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, 
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series.  Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2913.61.

has caused the tampering with intent to commit a theft offense.
   (b)   In a prosecution for a theft offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2913.01,

standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.

serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value for juveniles.
   (b)   "Juvenile."  Any unmarried person under 18 years of age.

performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest.

      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality.
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

purpose.

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

698.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Dangerous offender" means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   "Repeat offender" means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;

subsequent offense;

(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this

(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant
to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a

intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section.  The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the

of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the

            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment

also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the

definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120

         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. §2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. §2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated
the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.

by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.

municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.

term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.

   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim's economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. The court may base the
amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the
offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating
the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other information, provided
that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the court holds an
evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from
the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.

sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division  (d),
(e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to
the Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
seventy dollars ($70.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), which
shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be credited to the address
confidentiality program fund created by Ohio R.C. 111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. 
A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1)(a) to (e) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(ORC 2929.28)
698.03  IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall determine consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section.
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04  ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand

thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05  MULTIPLE SENTENCES. 
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or  sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States.  Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131.  When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

   (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Section
698.06 was repealed as part of the 2003 updating and revision of these Codified
Ordinances because substantially equivalent State law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was

guilty to a violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is
substantially equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is
permitted or required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to
any other penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or
commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for
the period of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of
suspension imposed for the violation of the provision of this Code of
Ordinances shall not exceed the period of suspension that is permitted or
required to be imposed for the violation of the provision of the Revised Code
to which the provision of this Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.

804.05  EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   A license shall not be valid beyond the expiration date therein specified
and, unless otherwise provided, shall not extend beyond December 31 of the year
issued; except that at any time after December 14 licenses may be issued for

provision of this chapter or other law or ordinance relating to the operation
of the business or enterprise for which the license has been issued; or upon

restrictive zoning district allowing such land use, provided, however, that new
signs associated with nonconforming land uses in residential zoning districts
shall be only as permitted for home occupations. Further, no new signs
associated with nonconforming land uses shall be erected, except replacements
that are the same or smaller in size than the sign being replaced. In the event
that a sign associated with a nonconforming land use is moved or replaced, its
new size and location must conform to requirements of this chapter. If a legal
nonconforming land use is discontinued for more than 6 months, all signs
associated with the discontinued use shall be deemed obsolete, even if their
message is removed, covered or otherwise obscured.

calendar days pass between time periods, regardless of calendar year when at
least one time period involves a portable sign. A minimum of 30 calendar days
must pass between time periods when both time periods involve banner signs. A
"Time Period" shall consist of 30 consecutive calendar days for a portable sign
or 60 consecutive calendar days for a banner sign.  A separate temporary sign

shall be granted during any calendar year. However, a permit may be submitted
once per year, subject to the provisions of division (i) of this section. A
time period shall not be subdivided into smaller increments to permit the
placement of a temporary sign on a property, or segment of such property, more
than the maximum number of  times within any calendar year. Temporary signs

dirigible-like structure over 2 feet in length shall be permitted. Balloons of
inconsequential size (less than 2 feet) and number shall not be regulated
provided they do not become a public nuisance or traffic hazard. Additional
flags may be permitted, provided their size is inconsequential, but may not
extend into the right-of-way. During any time period, a banner, flag, or
balloon may be changed in content or location, provide advance notice is given
to the City of the change, the change shall not extend the time period, and
provided the proposed change does not violate the Codified Ordinances of
Trenton.

32 square feet.
   (e)   Number.  One temporary sign shall be permitted per site.
   (f)   Height.  Temporary signs on buildings shall not be placed above roof
lines, except as stated below. Portable signs shall not exceed 8 feet in height
as measured from the ground beneath the sign. Balloons generally shall not

traffic safety or the public welfare is served by a shorter height. One
inflatable balloon or dirigible-like structure shall be permitted above the
building roof line for a period not to exceed one week per calendar year,
subject to the provisions of this section.
   (g)   Setbacks and Extensions into the Right-of-Way.  Temporary signs shall

check, certified check, or money order payable to the City. Said bond shall be
returned to the applicant only if the temporary sign is removed within 48 hours
of the expiration date of the temporary sign permit. Failure to remove the
temporary sign within the required time frame shall constitute forfeiture of
said bond. The City Manager may, at his or her sole discretion, waive the
bonding requirement for not-for-profit civic organizations. A single annual
temporary sign permit may be submitted each calendar year for multiple time
periods with the following provisions:
      (1)   The applicant shall provide a complete and accurate schedule of the
time periods and shall not vary from that schedule during the calendar year;
      (2)   The applicant shall identify the type, size, location and content
of each temporary sign at the time of application and shall notify the City in
advance of any change in content or location.
      (3)   One permit fee and one bond may be submitted, provided the bond is
in a negotiable instrument that does not expire during that calendar year;
      (4)   An annual temporary sign permit shall expire on December 31 of each
calendar year; and
      (5)   Failure to adhere to the provisions of this section shall result in
the immediate revocation of the annual temporary sign permit and bond, in
addition to the abatement and enforcement actions authorized therein.
   (j)   Variances, Appeals and Fees.  The provisions of Sections
826.24 and

826.21  SIGN PERMIT APPLICATION AND FEES.
   (a)   No sign, except those listed in Sections

maintain conformity with this chapter. All sign permits are issued subject to
the appeal provisions of Section
826.24.
   (b)   Permits shall bear a fee of two dollars ($2.00) for each square foot
of message area, or fifty dollars ($50.00), whichever is greater. However,

(Ord. 29-2002.  Passed 11-21-02.)
826.23  REMOVAL OF UNLAWFUL SIGNS.
   (a)   Any sign that violates the provisions of this chapter is a public and
private nuisance, and the City shall give 7 days notice by personal service or
by registered or certified mail to the owner or lessee of the land on which
such sign is located, to remove such sign. However, in the case of an unlawful
sign that is not permanently attached to the ground or to a building or
structure, the City need give only 24 hours notice to remove the sign. The
owner or lessee shall have the right of appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (b)   If any such sign has not been removed on or before the expiration of
the applicable notice period prescribed in division (a) of this section, or
within 7 days after the adverse decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals, the
City or any of its duly authorized agents may enter upon the premises and
cover, remove, or otherwise abate the sign. The cost of such covering, removal,
or abatement shall be paid out of any money in the City Treasury not otherwise
appropriated. City Council shall make a written return to the County Auditor
with a statement of the charges for services in covering, removing, or abating
the sign, together with a legal description of the parcel. Such amounts shall
be certified to the County Auditor for entry upon the tax duplicate, shall
constitute a lien upon such lands from the date of the entry, and shall be
collected as other taxes and returned to the City's General Fund.
   (c)   Notice to the owner or lessee shall not be required prior to the
removal of a hazardous sign which, in the opinion of the City Manager, creates
an immediate danger to persons or property due to structural design
deficiencies, inadequate maintenance or improper location. The City's entry
onto private property for the purpose of removing a hazardous sign shall not
constitute a trespass. Notice to the owner or lessee shall not be required
prior to the removal of any sign unlawfully placed on public property.
(Ord. 29-2002.  Passed 11-21-02.)
826.24  APPEALS AND FEES.

Section
826.22 may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals by any person directly
and adversely affected, if such appeal is filed within 10 days after the date
of the decision. A properly filed application appealing the decision of the
City Manager or designee relative to the legality of a sign under this chapter
shall stay all abatement action until a decision on that appeal is made by the
Board of Zoning Appeals, except for removal of a hazardous sign under the
provisions of Section
826.23(c).
   (b)   Applications for appeal shall bear a non-refundable fee of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
(Ord. 29-2002.  Passed 11-21-02.)
826.25  VARIANCES AND FEES.
   (a)   A variance from any provision of this chapter except message area or
allowable message area may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals where the
strict interpretation of this chapter would create an unusual and unnecessary
hardship on the property owner or occupant due to the unique location or
physical characteristics of the property, if such variance would not adversely
affect the public interest in any substantial manner, and if the relevant
physical characteristics of the property were not caused by a current or
previous owner or occupant. Intentional acts by an owner or occupant officially
approved by the City shall not operate as a bar to the determination of a
hardship.
   (b)   The City Planning Commission shall have authority to approve variances

Net Profits.  Where a person conducts a business both within and outside the
City of Trenton, the portion of the entire net profits of such business to be
allocated as having been made within the City of Trenton may be determined from
the records of such business, if such business had bona fide records which
disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profits is
attributable to that part of its activities conducted within the City of
Trenton, or at the option of the taxpayer may be determined by the following
formula, which shall be used if such taxpayer has no bona fide records showing
net profits from business activities within the City of Trenton, subject
however, to the provisions of subsection “d” hereof and the Rules and
Regulations as set forth in this Chapter.
      (1)   Multiply the entire net profits of the business by a business
allocation percentage to be determined by:
         A.   Ascertaining the percentage which the average net book value of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used in the business and
situated within the City of Trenton, during the period covered by the return,
is of the average net book value of all the real and tangible personal property
owned or used in the business, wherever situated, during such period.
         B.   Ascertaining the percentage which the gross receipts of the
business from sales made and services performed in the City of Trenton, during
the period covered by the return, are of the total gross receipts from all
sales and services, wherever made or performed, during such period.
         C.   Ascertaining the percentage which the total wages, salaries,
commissions and other compensation paid, during the period covered by the
return, to employees for services performed in the City of Trenton is of the
total wages, salaries, commissions and other compensation paid during such
period to all employees within and outside the Municipality, excluding
compensation described in Section “e”.
         D.   Adding together the percentages determined in accordance with
subsections (b)(1)A., (b)(1)B., and (b)(1)C. hereof, or such of the aforesaid
percentages as are applicable to the particular taxpayer and dividing the total
so obtained by the number of percentages used in deriving such total.
            1.   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable
entirely in or outside the City of Trenton.
            2.   Provided however, that in the event a just and equitable
result cannot be obtained under the formula provided for herein, the Tax
Commissioner, upon application of the taxpayer, shall have the authority to
substitute other factors or methods calculated to effect a fair and proper
allocation.  Should the taxpayer object to or disagree with the Tax
Commissioner’s decision, an appeal may be filed with the Board of Review which
shall have the power to adjust, modify, or overrule such decision by the
Commissioner of Taxation.
   (c)   Resident Trenton Corporations. A corporation whose sole business
location is within Trenton shall be considered a resident Trenton corporation
and shall disregard the business allocation formula and pay the tax on the
entire net profits of the corporate entity, with the allowance of credit for
tax paid to other municipalities (in accordance with Section
890.14) for work done or services performed in those municipalities.
   (d)   Operating Loss Carry-Forward.
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss, based on income taxable under
this chapter, sustained in the taxable year beginning after January 1, 1990,
allocable to the City may be applied against the portion of succeeding years
allocable to the City, until exhausted, but in no event for more than five
years immediately following the year in which the loss was sustained.  No
portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against the net profits
of any prior year.
      (2)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the City in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the City.
      (3)   The Commissioner shall provide for by rules and regulations the
manner in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
      (4)   The net operating loss sustained by a business or profession is not
deductible from employee earnings, but may be carried forward as provided in
subsection (c)(1).  However, if a taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable
business activities to be included in the same return, the net loss of one
unincorporated business activity (except any portion of a loss reportable for
municipal income tax purposes to another tax entity) may be used to offset the
profits of another for purposes of arriving at overall net profits.
      (5)   The net operating loss of a taxpayer that loses its legal identity,
by any means such as merger or consolidation, shall not be allowed as a carry
forward loss deduction to the surviving or new taxpayer. 
   (e)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   Consolidated returns shall be accepted in accordance with rules and
regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Taxation, from any affiliated
group of corporations subject to the Trenton tax, if that affiliated group
filed for the same tax reporting period a consolidated return for federal
income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   Once a consolidated return has been filed for any taxable year,
consolidated returns shall continue to be filed in subsequent years unless the
applicable requirements of the rules and regulations for discontinuing the
filing of consolidated returns have been met.
      (3)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory, or activity within the City
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Commissioner of Taxation
shall require such additional information as he may deem necessary to ascertain
whether net profits are properly allocated to the City. If the Commissioner of

branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other methods, he
shall make allocation as he deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper
allocation of net profits to the City.

(Ord. 05-2014.  Passed 3-6-14.)
890.04  EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   The tax imposed in Section
890.03 shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to the salaries, wages,
commissions and other compensation, and with respect to the net profits of
businesses, professions or other activities earned on and after July 1, 1989.
(Ord. 05-2014.  Passed 3-6-14.)
890.05  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each taxpayer shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon, make and
file a return on or before April 15 of the year following the effective date of
this section (Ordinance 837, passed September 4, 1969), and on or before April
15 of each year thereafter, or the due date as established by the Internal
Revenue Service. When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period
different from the calendar year, the return shall be filed within four months
from the end of such fiscal year or period. Taxpayers who have received no
earned income for three years in a row, and who are receiving pension and/or
Social Security, and who are age sixty-five or older, may be relieved of the
annual filing requirement.
   (b)   The Commissioner of Taxation is hereby authorized to provide by
regulation that a substitute form (generic or shortened) may be accepted as the
return required of any resident.
   (c)   The return shall be filed with the Commissioner of Taxation on a form
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Commissioner, or an acceptable
generic form, if the generic form, when completed and filed, contains all of
the information required to be submitted with the City of Trenton’s prescribed
returns, reports, or documents, and, if the taxpayer or return preparer filing
the generic form otherwise complies with the rules or ordinances of the City of
Trenton governing the filing of returns. The return shall set forth the
following:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned by him, and/or gross income from his business, profession
or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such
gross income earned during the preceding year and subject to such tax;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
federal or state tax returns and /or schedules, or other information as the
Commissioner may require.
   (d)   (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a
federal income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a City of
Trenton tax return.  The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of
the taxpayer’s request for a federal filing extension with the Commissioner of
Taxation. 
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to file for a federal extension may
request an extension for filing a City of Trenton tax return in writing and
mailed on or before the due date of the tax return. 
      (3)   A valid extension request extends the due date for filing a return
for six months from the original due date of such return.
      (4)   The City of Trenton may deny a taxpayer’s request for extension if
the taxpayer:
           A.   Fails to timely file the request;
           B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request;
           C.   Owes the City of Trenton any delinquent income tax or any
penalty, interest, assessment or other charge for the late payment or
nonpayment of income tax;
           D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report or
other related document for a prior tax period.
   (e)   The granting of an extension for filing a City of Trenton income tax
return does not extend the last date for paying the tax due without penalty;
hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of
extension at the rate set out by Section
890.10. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the provisions of
Section
890.07 (Declaration) have been complied with, the return is filed, and the
final tax paid within the extension period.  Any extension by the Tax
Commissioner shall be granted upon the condition that declaration filing and
payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further examination
it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment requirements have
not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in full and in the
same manner as though no extension had been granted.
   (f)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing such return,
pay to the Commissioner of Taxation the amount of taxes shown as due thereon,
provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due has been deducted
at the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
890.06, or where any portion of such tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of Section
890.07, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit
for the amount so paid in accordance with Section
890.14 shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing such return.
   (g)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder, or, at his election indicated on
the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded, provided that
no additional taxes or refunds of less than three dollars ($3.00) shall be
collected or refunded.
   (h)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or to claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Sections
890.11 and
890.14. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Commissioner of Taxation. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax liability
affecting the taxpayer’s City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make and file
an amended City return, showing income subject to the City income tax based
upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
(Ord. 05-2014.  Passed 3-6-14.)
890.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   In accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the
Commissioner of Taxation, each employer within or doing business within the
City shall deduct at the time of the payment or allocation of such salary,
wage, commission or other compensation, the tax of one and one half percent of
the gross salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due by such
employer to such employee and shall, when the taxes so deducted exceed four
hundred dollars ($400.00) in any month, make a return and pay to the
Commissioner of Taxation the amount of taxes so deducted on or before the last
day of the next succeeding month, or shall, when the taxes do not exceed four
hundred dollars ($400.00) in any month, make a return and pay to the
Commissioner the amount of taxes so deducted on or before the last day of the
month following the close of each calendar quarter. The Commissioner of
Taxation may revoke the approval of quarterly filing and payments whenever he
has reason to believe that the conditions for granting such authorization have
changed, were judged incorrectly, were not met or when it is in the best
interest of the City of Trenton to do so.  Notice of the withdrawal shall be
made in writing and in such case the employer shall begin to file in accordance
with this section. Such return shall be on a form prescribed by or acceptable
to the Commissioner and shall be subject to the rules and regulations
prescribed therefore by the Commissioner. Such employer shall be liable for the
payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld whether or not such
taxes have in fact been withheld.
   (b)   Qualifying wages for withholding are those which are defined in IRC
Section 3121(a), generally the Medicare wage in Box 5 of the Form W-2, with an
exception to include exempt employees hired before April 1, 1986.  IRC Section
125 wages are not included in the federal definition of Medicare wages and do
not need to be deducted from Box 5.
   (c)   Any person who is required to withhold tax from salaries, wages,
commissions, and other compensation shall pay all such tax to the City of
Trenton in accordance with the provisions of this section.  In the event taxes
withheld from the salaries, wages, commissions, and other compensation of
employees are not paid to the City of Trenton in accordance with the provisions
of this section, all officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees
having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing
the return and making payment are jointly and severally personally liable for
the tax not returned or paid to the City of Trenton as well as any related
interest and penalties, and are also liable under the provisions of Section
890.12 hereof. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer’s,
member’s, manager’s, employee’s, or trustee’s liability for a failure of the
corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or
pay said taxes. 
   (d)   Withholding return: list of employees. Each employer shall file a
withholding tax reconciliation showing the sum total of all compensation paid
all employees, the portion of which, (if any) was not subject to withholding
along with an explanation for same, and the portion of which was subject to
withholding, together with the amount of such withholdings remitted. Such
return shall include information concerning each employee from whom the City of
Trenton tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and social
security number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation paid
during the year and the amount of City of Trenton tax withheld.  If the total
tax withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to another
municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of
information to the City of Trenton concerning each employee. The withholding
tax reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before February 28th
following the end of such calendar year.  Use of a generic form is permissible,
although the information requirement remains the same.
   (e)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the City of Trenton when the services were
performed in the City of Trenton.  The information may be submitted on a
listing, and shall include the name, address, and social security number (or
Federal identification number), and the amount of the payments made.  Federal
form(s) 1099 may be submitted in lieu of such listing.  The information shall
be filed annually on or before February 28th following the end of such calendar
year.
   (f)   Domestic servants.  No person shall be required to withhold the tax on
the wages or other compensation paid domestic servants employed exclusively in
or about such person’s residence.  However, such domestic servants shall be
responsible for filing and paying their own returns and taxes. 
   (g)   Such employer in collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for the
benefit of the City, and any such tax collected by such employer from his
employees shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in
the hands of such employer.
   (h)   No change in structure by an employer, including a fundamental change,
discharges its officers from liability for the employees’ withholding taxes or
the officers’ failure to remit funds held in trust, to file tax returns, or to
pay taxes. An employee is not relieved from liability for the tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by this chapter or by
the employer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax. The failure
of an employer to remit to the City of Trenton the tax withheld relieves the
employee from liability for that tax withheld unless the employee colluded with
the employer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
(Ord. 05-2014.  Passed 3-6-14.)
890.07  DECLARATIONS.

thereof) may be increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly

the taxable year, provided, however, that in the event that an amended
declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon shall be paid
in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
   (f)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which such declaration of estimated tax or amended

the provisions of Section
890.05.

recoverable. Civil actions to recover  income taxes, penalties, and interest on
income taxes shall be brought within three years after the tax was due or the

three months from the time of the final determination of the federal tax
liability.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under this chapter shall

liability from another municipality pertaining to that same tax.  Full non-
refundable credit must be allowed if municipal taxes are incorrectly paid to
another municipality, but not refundable to the taxpayer due to the three year
statute of limitations.
   (d)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder, or, at his or her election,
indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded,
provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than three dollars ($3.00)
shall be collected or refunded.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment, except
that if any overpayment is refunded within ninety days after the final filing
date of the annual return or ninety days after the complete return is filed,
whichever is later. For purposes of computing the payment of interest on
overpayments, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be treated as having
been paid before the date on which the tax return for that year was due,
without regard to any extension of time for filing that return. The interest
shall be paid at the rate of interest prescribed by Ohio R.C. 5703.47.

on and after July 1, 1989, by all corporations that are not pass through
entities derived from sales made, work done or services performed or rendered
and business or other activities conducted in the City, whether or not such
corporations have an office or place of business in the City.
      (6)   A taxpayer subject to any municipal corporation’s tax on the net
profit from a business or profession may file any municipal income tax return
or estimated municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown
to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (b)   Businesses Both in and Outside the Municipal Boundaries; Allocation of
Net Profits.  Where a person conducts a business both within and outside the
City, the portion of the entire net profits of such business to be allocated as
having been made within the City may be determined from the records of such
business, if such business had bona fide records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy what portion of its net profits is attributable to that part of its
activities conducted within the City, or at the option of the taxpayer may be
determined by the following formula, which shall be used if such taxpayer has
no bona fide records showing net profits from business activities within the
City, subject however, to the provisions of subsection (d) hereof and the rules
and regulations as set forth in this chapter.
      (1)   Multiply the entire net profits of the business by a business
allocation percentage to be determined by:
         A.   Ascertaining the percentage which the average net book value of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used in the business and
situated within the City, during the period covered by the return, is of the
average net book value of all the real and tangible personal property owned or
used in the business, wherever situated, during such period.
         B.   Ascertaining the percentage which the gross receipts of the
business from sales made and services performed in the City, during the period
covered by the return, are of the total gross receipts from all sales and
services, wherever made or performed, during such period.
         C.   Ascertaining the percentage which the total wages, salaries,
commissions and other compensation paid, during the period covered by the
return, to employees for services performed in the City is of the total wages,
salaries, commissions and other compensation paid during such period to all
employees within and outside the Municipality, excluding compensation described
in subsection (e) hereof.
         D.   Adding together the percentages determined in accordance with
subsections (b)(1)A., B. and C. hereof, or such of the aforesaid percentages as
are applicable to the particular taxpayer and dividing the total so obtained by
the number of percentages used in deriving such total.
            1.   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable
entirely in or outside the City.
            2.   Provided however, that in the event a just and equitable
result cannot be obtained under the formula provided for herein, the Tax
Commissioner, upon application of the taxpayer, shall have the authority to
substitute other factors or methods calculated to effect a fair and proper
allocation.  Should the taxpayer object to or disagree with the Tax
Commissioner’s decision, an appeal may be filed with the Board of Review which
shall have the power to adjust, modify, or overrule such decision by the
Commissioner of Taxation.
   (c)   A corporation whose sole business location is within Trenton shall be
considered a resident Trenton corporation and shall disregard the business
allocation formula and pay the tax on the entire net profits of the corporate
entity, with the allowance of credit for tax paid to other municipalities (in
accordance with Section
891.14) for work done or services performed in those municipalities.
   (d)   Operating Loss Carry-Forward.
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss, based on income taxable under
the chapter, sustained in the taxable year beginning after January 1, 1990,
allocable to the City may be applied against the portion of succeeding years
allocable to the City, until exhausted, but in no event for more than five
years immediately following the year in which the loss was sustained.  No
portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against the net profits
of any prior year.
      (2)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the City in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the City.
      (3)   The Commissioner shall provide for by rules and regulations the
manner in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
      (4)   The net operating loss sustained by a business or profession is not
deductible from employee earnings, but may be carried forward as provided in
subsection (c)(1) hereof.  However, if a taxpayer is engaged in two or more
taxable business activities to be included in the same return, the net loss of
one unincorporated business activity (except any portion of a loss reportable
for municipal income tax purposes to another tax entity) may be used to offset
the profits of another for purposes of arriving at overall net profits.
      (5)   The net operating loss of a taxpayer that loses its legal identity,
by any means such as merger or consolidation, shall not be allowed as a carry
forward loss deduction to the surviving or new taxpayer.
   (e)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   Consolidated returns shall be accepted in accordance with rules and
regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Taxation, from any affiliated
group of corporations subject to the Trenton tax, if that affiliated group
filed for the same tax reporting period a consolidated return for Federal
income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   Once a consolidated return has been filed for any taxable year,
consolidated returns shall continue to be filed in subsequent years unless the
applicable requirements of the Rules and Regulations for discontinuing the
filing of consolidated returns have been met.
      (3)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory, or activity within the City
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Commissioner of Taxation
shall require such additional information as he may deem necessary to ascertain
whether net profits are properly allocated to the City. If the Commissioner of
Taxation finds net profits are not properly allocated to the City by reason of
transactions with stockholders, or with other corporations related by stock
ownership, interlocking directorates, or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other methods, he
shall make allocation as he deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper
allocation of net profits to the City.
   (f)   Exclusions.  The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed as
levying a tax upon the following:
      (1)   Poor relief, welfare benefits, unemployment insurance benefits,
supplemental unemployment benefits, old age pensions or similar payments

nonprofit association or organization enumerated in Ohio R.C. 718.01 to the
extent that such income is derived from tax-exempt real estate, tax-exempt

or organization not exempt from the payment of real estate taxes is required to
file declarations and final returns and remit the taxes levied under this
chapter on all business activities of a type ordinarily conducted for profit by
taxpayers operating for profit. Where such nonprofit association or
organization conducts income producing business both within and without the
corporate limits, it shall calculate its profits allocable to the City under
the method authorized in subsection (b) hereof.
      (12)   If exempt for Federal income tax purposes, fellowship and
scholarship grants are excluded from City income tax.
      (13)   Compensation paid under Ohio R.C. 3501.28 or 3501.36 to a person

exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) annually.  Such compensation in excess of
one thousand dollars ($1,000) may be subjected to taxation.  The payer of such
compensation is not required to withhold City tax from that compensation.
      (14)   Compensation paid to an employee of a transit authority, regional
transit authority, or a regional transit commission created under Ohio R.C.
Chapter 306 for operating a transit bus or other motor vehicle for the

operated on a regularly scheduled route, the operator is subject to such tax by
reason of residence or domicile in Trenton, or the headquarters of the
authority or commission is located within Trenton.
      (15)   The City shall not tax the compensation paid to a nonresident
individual for personal services performed by the individual in the City on
twelve or fewer days in a calendar year unless one of the following applies:

         B.   The individual is a professional entertainer or professional

employee of such promoter, all as may be reasonably defined by the City.
      (16)   The income of a public utility when that public utility is subject
to the tax levied under Ohio R.C. 5727.24 or 5727.30, except starting January

      (18)   If an individual’s taxable income includes income against which

of his compensation, to the extent used by him to rent or provide a home
pursuant to section 107 of the Internal Revenue Code.

         B.   Amounts received from an employer for expenses and not as

(Ord. 13-2015.  Passed 12-17-15.)
891.04  EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   The tax imposed in Section
891.03 shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to the salaries, wages,
commissions and other compensation, and with respect to the net profits of
businesses, professions or other activities earned on and after July 1, 1989.
(Ord. 13-2015.  Passed 12-17-15.)
891.05  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each taxpayer shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon, make and
file a return on or before April 15 of the year following the effective date of
this section (Ordinance 837, passed September 4, 1969), and on or before April
15 of each year thereafter, or the due date as established by the Internal
Revenue Service. When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period
different from the calendar year, the return shall be filed within four months
from the end of such fiscal year or period.
      (1)   Taxpayers who have received no earned income for three years in a
row, and who are receiving pension and/or Social Security, and who are age
sixty-five or older, may be relieved of the annual filing requirement.
   (b)   The Commissioner of Taxation is hereby authorized to provide by
regulation that a substitute form (generic or shortened) may be accepted as the
return required of any resident.
   (c)   The return shall be filed with the Commissioner of Taxation on a form
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Commissioner, or an acceptable
generic form, if the generic form, when completed and filed, contains all of
the information required to be submitted with the City’s prescribed returns,
reports, or documents, and, if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the rules or ordinances of the City
governing the filing of returns.  The return shall set forth the following:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned by him, and/or gross income from his business, profession
or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such
gross income earned during the preceding year and subject to such tax;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
Federal or State tax returns and/or schedules, or other information as the
Commissioner may require.
   (d)   (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a
Federal income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a City tax
return.  The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s
request for a Federal filing extension with the Commissioner of Taxation.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to file for a Federal extension may
request an extension for filing a City tax return in writing and mailed on or
before the due date of the tax return.
      (3)   A valid extension request extends the due date for filing a return
for six months from the original due date of such return.
      (4)   The City may deny a taxpayer’s request for extension if the
taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request;
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the Federal extension request;
         C.   Owes the City any delinquent income tax or any penalty, interest,
assessment or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax;
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report or
other related document for a prior tax period.
   (e)   The granting of an extension for filing a City income tax return does
not extend the last date for paying the tax due without penalty; hence, penalty
and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of extension at the
rate set out by Section
891.10.  No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the provisions of
Section
891.07 (Declaration) have been complied with, the return is filed, and the
final tax paid within the extension period.  Any extension by the Tax
Commissioner shall be granted upon the condition that declaration filing and
payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further examination
it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment requirements have
not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in full and in the
same manner as though no extension had been granted.
   (f)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing such return,
pay to the Commissioner of Taxation the amount of taxes shown as due thereon,
provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due has been deducted
at the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
891.06, or where any portion of such tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of Section
891.07, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit
for the amount so paid in accordance with Section
891.14 shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing such return.
   (g)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder, or, at his election indicated on
the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded, provided that
no additional taxes or refunds of less than three dollars ($3.00) shall be
collected or refunded.
   (h)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or to claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Sections
891.11 and
891.14. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Commissioner of Taxation. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended City return, showing income subject to the City income tax
based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
(Ord. 837.  Passed 9-4-69; Ord. 13-2015.  Passed 12-17-15.)
891.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   In accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the
Commissioner of Taxation, each employer within or doing business within the
City shall deduct at the time of the payment or allocation of such salary,
wage, commission or other compensation, the tax of one and one-half percent of
the gross salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due by such
employer to such employee and shall, when the taxes so deducted exceed four
hundred dollars ($400.00) in any month, make a return and pay to the
Commissioner of Taxation the amount of taxes so deducted on or before the last
day of the next succeeding month, or shall, when the taxes do not exceed four
hundred dollars ($400.00) in any month, make a return and pay to the
Commissioner the amount of taxes so deducted on or before the last day of the
month following the close of each calendar quarter. The Commissioner of
Taxation may revoke the approval of quarterly filing and payments whenever he
has reason to believe that the conditions for granting such authorization have
changed, were judged incorrectly, were not met or when it is in the best
interest of the City to do so.  Notice of the withdrawal shall be made in
writing and in such case the employer shall begin to file in accordance with
this section.  Such return shall be on a form prescribed by or acceptable to
the Commissioner and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed
therefore by the Commissioner.  Such employer shall be liable for the payment
of the tax required to be deducted and withheld whether or not such taxes have
in fact been withheld.
   (b)   Qualifying wages for withholding are those which are defined in IRC
section 3121(a), generally the Medicare wage in Box 5 of the Form W-2, with an
exception to include exempt employees hired before April 1, 1986.  IRC section
125 wages are not included in the Federal definition of Medicare wages and do
not need to be deducted from Box 5.
   (c)   Any person who is required to withhold tax from salaries, wages,
commissions, and other compensation shall pay all such tax to the City in
accordance with the provisions of this section.  In the event taxes withheld
from the salaries, wages, commissions, and other compensation of employees are
not paid to the City in accordance with the provisions of this section, all
officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and
making payment are jointly and severally personally liable for the tax not
returned or paid to the City as well as any related interest and penalties, and
are also liable under the provisions of Section
891.10.  The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation, limited
liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer’s, member’s,
manager’s, employee’s, or trustee’s liability for a failure of the corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or pay said taxes.
   (d)   Withholding return: list of employees.  Each employer shall file a
withholding tax reconciliation showing the sum total of all compensation paid
all employees, the portion of which, (if any) was not subject to withholding
along with an explanation for same, and the portion of which was subject to
withholding, together with the amount of such withholdings remitted.  Such
return shall include information concerning each employee from whom the City
tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and social security
number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation paid during the
year and the amount of City tax withheld.  If the total tax withheld from any
employee included tax withheld and remitted to another municipality, the amount
of same shall be separately shown on the return of information to the City
concerning each employee.  The withholding tax reconciliation shall be filed by
each employer on or before February 28th following the end of such calendar
year.  Use of a generic form is permissible, although the information
requirement remains the same.
   (e)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the City when the services were performed in the
City.  The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall include the
name, address, and social security number (or Federal identification number),
and the amount of the payments made.  Federal form(s) 1099 may be submitted in
lieu of such listing.  The information shall be filed annually on or before
February 28th following the end of such calendar year.
   (f)   Domestic servants.  No person shall be required to withhold the tax on
the wages or other compensation paid domestic servants employed exclusively in
or about such person’s residence. However, such domestic servants shall be
responsible for filing and paying their own returns and taxes.
   (g)   Such employer in collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for the
benefit of the City, and any such tax collected by such employer from his
employees shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in
the hands of such employer.
(Ord. 837.  Passed 9-4-69.)
   (h)   No change in structure by an employer, including a fundamental change,
discharges its officers from liability for the employees’ withholding taxes or
the officers’ failure to remit funds held in trust, to file tax returns, or to
pay taxes.
   (i)   An employee is not relieved from liability for the tax by the failure
of the employer to withhold the tax as required by this chapter or by the
employer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (1)   The failure of an employer to remit to the City the tax withheld
relieves the employee from liability for that tax withheld unless the employee
colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the tax
withheld.
(Ord. 13-2015.  Passed 12-17-15.)
891.07  DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Every taxpayer who anticipates any taxable income which is not subject
to Section
891.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
subject to the tax imposed by Section
891.03, shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any.
   If upon the filing of the return required by Section
870.05 hereof it appears that the taxpayer did not pay an amount equal to or
greater than the tax paid for the previous year, or did not pay ninety percent
of his tax liability, as shown on said return, on or before December 15th, or
the 15th day of the month following the close of his fiscal year, whichever is
applicable, the difference between ninety percent of said taxpayer’s tax
liability and the amount of estimated tax he actually paid on or before said
date shall be subject to the interest and penalty provisions of Section
870.10.
   Additionally,  a person need not file a declaration of estimated tax form if
a person’s income is wholly from wages from which the tax will be withheld and
remitted to this or another municipality in accordance with Sections
870.03,
870.06, and
870.14.
   (b)   Such declaration of estimated tax shall be filed on or before April 15
of each year, or on or before the 15th day of the 4th month following the date
the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.  Those taxpayers having
a fiscal year or period differing from the calendar year shall file a
declaration on or before the 15th day of the 4th month following the start of
each fiscal year or period.
   (c)   Such declaration of estimated tax shall be filed upon a form furnished
by, or obtainable from, the Commissioner of Taxation, or an acceptable generic
form, provided, however, that credit shall be taken for the City tax to be
withheld from any portion of such income. In accordance with the provisions of
Section
891.14, credit may be taken for tax to be withheld and remitted to another
taxing municipality.
   (d)   The original declaration of estimated tax (or any subsequent amendment
thereof) may be increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly
payment date as provided for herein.
   (e)   Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid to the City shall be
accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the estimated annual tax and
at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the 15th day of the sixth,
ninth, and thirteenth months after the beginning of the taxable year, provided,
however, that in the event that an amended declaration has been filed, the
unpaid balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
   (f)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month of the year following
that for which such declaration of estimated tax or amended declaration of
estimated tax was filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which
may be due the City shall be paid therewith in accordance with the provisions
of Section
891.05.

of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.
(Ord. 837.  Passed 9-4-69.)
   (e)   Portions of this tax chapter and tax regulations imposed by this
chapter vary from the income tax imposed by the Congress of the United States. 
The rules and regulations imposed by the Commissioner of Taxation pursuant to
subsection (c) hereof need not correspond with those imposed by the Internal

of a majority of the Board of Review, the Commissioner of Taxation shall have
the power to compromise penalty and interest liabilities imposed by this

(Ord. 13-2015.  Passed 12-17-15.)
891.09  INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF THE COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION; DIVULGING

authorized to examine the books, papers, records and Federal income tax returns
of any employer or of any taxpayer or person subject to the tax for the purpose
of verifying the accuracy of any return made, or, if no return was made, to
ascertain the tax due under this chapter.  Every such employer, supposed
employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer is hereby directed and required to
furnish upon written request by the Commissioner of Taxation, or his duly
authorized agent or employee, the means, facilities and opportunity for making
such examinations and investigations as are hereby authorized.
   (b)   The Commissioner of Taxation is hereby authorized to order any person
presumed to have knowledge of the facts to appear before him and examine such

returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect such income, and for

liability for a period of six years from the date his return is filed, or the
withholding taxes are paid.
(Ord. 13-2015.  Passed 12-17-15.)
891.10  INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   All taxes imposed, including estimated taxes required to be paid, and

withholdings, at the rate of one percent per month or fraction thereof.
   (b)   In addition to interest as provided in subsection (a) hereof,
penalties based on the unpaid tax are hereby imposed as follows:
      (1)   For failure to pay taxes due, other than taxes withheld, one
percent per month or fraction thereof;
      (2)   For failure to remit taxes withheld from employees, three percent
per month or fraction thereof;
      (3)   Where the taxpayer has:
         A.   Failed to file a declaration of estimated tax on or before April
15 and pay all estimated taxes so declared on or before the 15th of the month
following the end of his taxable year on which he has estimated and paid a tax
equal to or greater than the tax paid for the previous year;
         B.   Where he has filed a previous return and has failed to file a
declaration on which he has estimated and paid a tax equal to or greater than
the tax paid for the previous year, or failed to file a declaration on which he
has estimated and paid tax equal to or greater than ninety percent of the
actual tax for the year, a penalty of ten percent of the difference between
ninety percent of the actual tax for the year and the amount of tax paid
through estimated, withholding, or declaration; or
         C.   Failed to file a return and pay the total tax on or before the
15th of the month following the end of his taxable year; a penalty of ten
percent of the difference between ninety percent of the actual tax for the year

      (4)   Except in the case of fraud, the penalty shall not exceed fifty
percent of the unpaid tax.
   (c)   Exceptions.  No penalty shall be assessed on an additional tax
assessment made by the Commissioner of Taxation when a return has been filed in
good faith and the tax paid thereon within the time prescribed by the
Commissioner of Taxation, and provided further, that, in the absence of fraud,
neither penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any additional tax assessment
resulting from a Federal audit, providing an amended return is filed and the
additional tax is paid within three months after final determination of the
Federal tax liability.
   (d)   Upon recommendation of the Commissioner of Taxation, the Board of
Review may abate penalty or interest, or both, or upon an appeal from the
refusal of the Commissioner of Taxation to recommend abatement of penalty and
interest, the Board may nevertheless abate penalty or interest, or both.
   (e)   For any persons or businesses who are currently charged with a
criminal violation for failure to file or failure to pay Trenton City Earnings
Tax, the City Attorney shall recommend appropriate action to be taken, and with
the approval of the Mayor and City Treasurer, the penalties and interest may be
waived if justice so indicates.
(Ord. 13-2015.  Passed 12-17-15.)
891.11  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectable, together with
any interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as other debts of like amount are
recoverable.  Civil actions to recover income taxes, penalties, and interest on
income taxes shall be brought within three years after the tax was due or the
return was filed, whichever is later.  Provided, however, in those cases in
which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a
waiver of the Federal statute of limitations, the period within which an
additional assessment may be made by the Commissioner of Taxation shall be
three months from the time of the final determination of the Federal tax
liability.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under this chapter shall
be commenced within three years after the commission of the offense, provided
that in the case of fraud, failure to file a return, or the omission of twenty-
five percent of more of income required to be reported prosecutions may be
commenced within six years after the commission of the offense.
   (c)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund
is made within three years from the date which such payment was made or the
return was due, or within three months, whichever is later, after final
determination of the Federal tax liability or a determination of municipal tax
liability from another municipality pertaining to that same tax.  Full non-
refundable credit must be allowed if municipal taxes are incorrectly paid to
another municipality, but not refundable to the taxpayer due to the three year
statute of limitations.
   (d)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder, or, at his or her election,
indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded,
provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than three dollars ($3.00)
shall be collected or refunded.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment, except
that if any overpayment is refunded within ninety days after the final filing
date of the annual return or ninety days after the complete return is filed,
whichever is later.  For purposes of computing the payment of interest on
overpayments, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be treated as having
been paid before the date on which the tax return for that year was due,
without regard to any extension of time for filing that return.  The interest
shall be paid at the rate of interest prescribed by Ohio R.C. 5703.47.
(Ord. 13-2015.  Passed 12-17-15.)

of Taxation, and, at the request of the taxpayer or Commissioner of Taxation,
is hereby empowered to substitute alternate methods of allocation.
   (c)   Whenever the Commissioner of Taxation issues a decision regarding an
income tax obligation that is subject to appeal as provided in this section, or
in an ordinance or regulation of the City, the Commissioner of Taxation shall
notify the taxpayer at the same time of the taxpayer’s right to appeal the
decision and of the manner in which the taxpayer may appeal the decision.
   (d)   Any person dissatisfied with any ruling or decision of the
Commissioner of Taxation, which is made under the authority conferred by this
chapter, may appeal therefrom to the Board in writing within thirty days from
the announcement of such ruling or decision by the Commissioner of Taxation. 
The Board shall, on hearing, have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse or modify any
such ruling or decision, or any part thereof.
(Ord. 837.  Passed 9-4-69.)
   (e)   The imposition of penalty and interest as prescribed in this chapter
is not a sole basis for an appeal.
   (f)   The Board of Review shall schedule a hearing within forty-five days

accountant or other representative.

the Board of Review to the courts or to the State Board of Tax Appeals as

District income tax in a Joint Economic Development District, he shall receive
a credit, not to exceed one and one-half percent against the tax imposed by
this chapter of the earnings taxed by such a municipality or Joint Economic
Development District, and shall not pay a total municipal income tax on the
other income greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate.
   (b)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the City who receives net
profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service compensation
for work done, or services performed or rendered outside of the City, if it
appears that he has paid a municipal income tax or Joint Economic Development
District tax on the same source of income taxable under this chapter to another
municipality or Joint Economic Development District, shall be allowed a credit
not to exceed one and one-half percent against the tax imposed by this chapter
of the amount of tax so paid by him, or on his behalf to such other
municipality or Joint Economic Development District.  The credit shall not
exceed the tax assessed by this chapter on such source of income earned in such
other municipality or Joint Economic Development District, where such tax is
paid.
   (c)   A claim for refund or credit under this section shall be made in such
manner as the Commissioner of Taxation may by regulation provide.
(Ord. 13-2015.  Passed 12-17-15.)
891.15  SEPARABILITY.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax against
any individual or any of the several groups specified herein, is found to be
unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality, illegality or
invalidity shall affect only such clause, sentence, section or part of this
chapter and shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions,
sentences, clauses, sections or other parts of this chapter.  It is hereby
declared to be the intention of Council, that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included herein.

not more than sixty days, or both, for each offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of Section
891.09(d) is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree, and shall be fined
not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned not more than sixty

1010.02  PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF CHAPTER.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation of the
use or occupation of all rights-of-way in the municipality, the issuance of
right-of-way permits to persons for such use or occupancy and to set forth the
policies of the municipality related thereto.
   (b)   A right-of-way permit issued pursuant to this chapter does not take
the place of any Franchise, license, or permit which may be additionally
required by law, including any required by
Chapter 1020.  Each permittee shall obtain any and all such additional state,
federal or municipality franchises, licenses or permits necessary to the
operation and conduct of its business or the occupation or use of any right-of-
way; provided, however, that no permittee holding a valid right-of-way permit
shall be required to obtain a franchise for any type of services rendered by
said permittee for which the municipality did not require franchise  at the
time said permittee's permit was last issued or renewed.  Should there be a
direct conflict between the provisions of this chapter and a valid franchise,
the provisions of the franchise shall prevail; provided, however, that
additional obligations shall not be construed as a conflict.
   (c)   The Administrator is hereby directed and empowered to enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
   (d)   The municipality's policy regarding rights-of-way is:
      (1)   To promote the utilization of rights-of-way for the public health,
safety and welfare and to promote economic development in the municipality;
      (2)   To promote the availability of a wide range of utility,
communication and other services, including the rapid deployment of new
technologies and innovative services, to the municipality's residents and
taxpayers at reasonable costs;
      (3)   To promote cooperation among the permittees and the municipality in
the occupation of rights-of-way, and work therein, in order to minimize public
inconvenience during right-of-way work, and eliminate wasteful, unnecessary or
unsightly duplication of facilities;
      (4)   To promote public safety and protect public property;
      (5)   To ensure adequate public compensation for private use of the
rights-of-way and the costs related thereto, including the regulation thereof;
      (6)   To promote and require reasonable accommodation of all uses of
rights-of-way; and when all requests for right-of-way use cannot be
accomplished, to give priority for use of rights-of-way, in the order
indicated, from highest to lowest, to the following users:
         A.   The municipality for governmental purposes;
         B.   Another governmental entity for governmental purposes with the
municipality's concurrence, or other governmental use required by law;
         C.   General right-of-way permittees and proprietary uses by the
municipality; and
         D.   Limited right-of-way permittees; provided, however, that the
Administrator may reasonably require cooperation and accommodation among
permittees in the public interest; and that any priorities applied to public
utilities or cable operators shall not be unduly discriminatory and shall be
competitively neutral; and
      (7)   To assure that applicants have the financial, technical and
managerial resources to comply with this chapter and the provisions of any
right-of-way permit issued hereunder; provided that, for purposes of this
chapter, an applicant possessing valid certification from the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio, including certification pursuant to R.C. 4933.81 et seq.,
for the services to be provided by the facilities subject to this Chapter shall
be presumed to possess the requisite financial, technical and managerial
resources, unless otherwise shown by clear and convincing evidence.
   (e)   All right-of-way permits granted hereunder shall be non-exclusive and
no property right of any nature shall be created by the granting of a permit
under this chapter.
   (f)   This chapter does not apply, and nothing herein should be construed to
apply the provisions of this chapter, to structures or facilities owned or
operated by the municipality or any municipality operations that occupy or use
the rights-of-way.  Further, the costs imposed by the municipality's occupancy
or use of the rights-of -way shall not be included in the costs to the
municipality to maintain and manage the rights-of-way.  It is specifically
contemplated, however, that the municipality shall carry out its operations in
a manner consistent with the policy set forth in this chapter, including
participation and cooperation in all joint planning hereunder and
identification of structures and facilities located in the rights-of-way.
(Ord. 06-2007. Passed 5-3-07.)
1010.03  PROHIBITION; TYPES OF PERMITS; RIGHT-OF-WAY COMMITTEE.
   (a)   Unless otherwise permitted pursuant to this code, no person shall use,
occupy, construct, own or operate structures or facilities in, under or over
any rights-of-way or any public property within the municipality unless such

permittee to another person contemporaneously followed by the leasing of the
property to the permittee on a long term basis, that are not operated or
controlled by said lessor, and are operated or controlled by the permittee, are
not considered to be using, occupying, owing or operating such facilities, for
purposes of this chapter solely as a result of such leaseback so long as the
lessee or operator of the facilities has obtained the necessary right-of-way
permit authorizing the placement of such facilities in the right-of-way.
   (b)   The following types of right-of-way permits are available:
      (1)   General right-of-way permit - right-of-way permit granted to

person for a specific, limited use of the rights-of-way or a specific portion
thereof as further delineated in such permit.  A limited right-of-way permit

way.  Limited right-of-way permits may be granted for any amount of right-of-
way to agencies of the government of the United States, the State of Ohio, or
its political subdivisions for governmental purposes. 
      (3)   Nothing in this chapter should be construed to preclude the

cable television, communications or other utility services for which the
municipality may lawfully require a franchise, to acquire a franchise upon the
expiration of any right-of-way permit issued hereunder.
   (c)   Any such right-of-way permit may also allow the use of specified
public property for the uses set forth in the right-of-way permit and in this
chapter.
   (d)   Each right-of-way permit shall specify the use or uses for which it is
granted and contain such other non-discriminatory terms and conditions as are
appropriate and as are set forth in the regulations.
   (e)   Unless otherwise set forth herein, right-of-way permits or the rights
of a permittee hereunder are not transferable without the prior express written
approval of the administrator, upon written request.  An application for
approval of the transfer of a right of way permit shall be made to the city

liable for any additional right-of-way permit fees over and above any franchise
fees specified in its franchise for uses of rights-of-way directly related to
the uses for which such permittee holds its franchise , so long as the amount
of such fees due in each quarter is equal to or greater than the amounts
otherwise due the municipality pursuant to Section
1010.07(B).  If the amount due under Section
1010.07(B) is more than said franchise fees, then the permittee shall receive a
credit in each quarter against such amount for all such fees paid in such
quarter, and shall pay the balance to the municipality as set forth in Section
1010.07(E).  Any cable television provider that has a valid franchise to
operate a cable television system within the Municipality shall not be liable
for any additional right-of-way permit fees over and above any cable television
franchise fees specified in its cable television franchise for uses of rights-
of-way directly related to the uses for which such cable television provider
holds a cable franchise, so long as the amount of such fees due in each quarter
is equal to or greater than the amounts otherwise due the municipality pursuant
to Section
1010.07(B).  If the amount due under Section
1010.07(B) is more than said cable franchise fees, then the cable television
provider shall receive a credit in each quarter against such amount for all
such fees paid in such quarter, and shall pay the balance to the municipality
as set forth in Section
1010.07(E).
   (b)   General right-of-way permit fees. In addition to any fees charged
pursuant to
Chapter 1020, all general right-of-way permittees, shall pay an annual fee, for
each calendar year in an amount equal to three hundred dollars ($300.00),
   (c)   Limited right-of-way permit fees.  In addition to any fees charged
pursuant to
Chapter 1020, limited right-of-way permittees shall pay an annual fee of three
hundred dollars ($300.00).  This fee shall be waived for all limited right-of-
way permits for residential purposes and may be waived by the Administrator for
limited right-of-way permittees that are agencies of the government of the
United States, the State of Ohio, or its political subdivisions.  Such fee
shall be paid in advance for each calendar year prior to January 31 of such
year.

the fees set forth in Sections
1010.07(B) and (C) may be set forth in the regulations.

maps, documents and other evidence for inspection, copying and audit to the
extent necessary to assure that the payments hereunder are accurate and that
all right-of-way permittees fully comply with the provisions of this chapter
and their respective right-of-way permits, subject to the provisions of federal
and state law.
   (g)   Any increase in fees must be by ordinance of the Municipal Council.
(Ord. 06-2007. Passed 5-3-07.)
1010.08  JOINT PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION.
   In order to promote the purposes of this chapter and the policy set forth
herein, the Administrator shall adopt regulations requiring and governing joint
planning and construction for all right-of-way permittees except for limited
right-of-way permittees for residential purposes.  Such regulations shall not,
however, require a Permittee to divulge trade secrets or other competitively
sensitive confidential information release of which would cause material injury
to the permittee.  Such regulations shall also require any confidential
information of a permittee in the possession of the municipality be treated as
such, to the extent determined legally appropriate by the Municipal Attorney.
(Ord. 06-2007. Passed 5-3-07.)
1010.09  MUNICIPALITY USE OF FACILITIES.
   Except for traffic control facilities and facilities in place as of the
effective date of this chapter, facilities that are the subject of other
agreements between the municipality and a permittee, or as otherwise provided
by law, the municipality shall not install or maintain upon any poles and
within any underground pipes or conduits or other facilities of any general or
limited right-of-way permittee, any facilities desired by the municipality for
the municipality's use without the consent of such permittee unless:
   (a)   Such installation and maintenance is lawful and consistent with good
engineering and construction practice and all appropriate safety codes;
   (b)   Such installation and maintenance does not unreasonably and materially
interfere with existing and future operations of the Permittee;
   (c)   Such installation and maintenance is not unduly burdensome to such
permittee;
   (d)   The Municipality enters into an agreement with the permittee which
specifies other appropriate and reasonable terms and conditions, including
compensation governing the use of Permittee's facilities; and
   (e)   The Municipality's use is non-discriminatory.  Each permittee shall
cooperate with the municipality in the development of a facility use agreement
for such municipal facilities.  Each permittee shall cooperate with the
municipality in planning and designing its facilities so as to accommodate the
municipality's reasonably disclosed requirements in this regard.  Copies of all
agreements hereunder shall be filed with the Administrator.
(Ord. 06-2007. Passed 5-3-07.)
1010.10  ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS.
   (a)   In accordance with the provisions of Section
1010.10(C), the Administrator may promulgate regulations, as the Administrator
deems appropriate from time to time, to carry out the express purposes and
intent of this chapter, including regulations governing the procedures of the
right-of-way committee.  Such proposed regulations shall be filed with the City
Treasurer to be placed on Council's agenda for action subsequent to the comment
period noted below.  Each general right-of-way permittee shall be served with a
copy of the proposed regulations by regular U.S. mail; provided, however, that
any failure of any permittee to actually receive such notice shall not in any
way affect the validity or enforceability of such regulation.  Any person,
including any permittee, may file specific written comments or objections on
the proposed regulations with the Clerk of Council within a thirty day period
after such publication (hereinafter "Comment Period").
   (b)   Such regulations shall not materially increase the obligations of any
permittee hereunder.  In promulgating such regulations, including those related
to Section
1010.06(A), the Administrator shall, among other appropriate factors, consider
the costs of permittee compliance as an important factor in determining the
appropriateness of the regulations.
   (c)   The proposed regulations shall automatically become effective thirty
days after the end of the comment period (or such longer period as determined
by Council), unless such regulation is modified or rejected by a resolution or
ordinance of Council.
(Ord. 06-2007. Passed 5-3-07.)
   (d)   The regulations implementing the comprehensive right-of-way management
ordinance are hereby adopted by reference as presented in Ord. 07-2007, passed
5-3-07. 
(Ord. 07-2007.  Passed 5-3-07.)
1010.11  INDEMNITY; INSURANCE.
   (a)   Except for limited right-of-way permittees for residential purposes,
each permittee shall, as a condition of its right-of-way permit, indemnify,
protect and hold harmless the municipality from any claim, loss or damage
arising in any way from permittee's occupation or use of the right-of-way,
including but not limited to the construction, operation or maintenance of
permittee's facilities, and from any such permittee's negligent or wrongful act
or omission excluding, however, claims arising from the municipality's sole
negligence or willful misconduct.
   (b)   Except for limited right-of-way permittees for residential purposes,
each permittee, as a condition of its permit, shall keep in force a policy or
policies of liability insurance, having such terms and in such amounts as are
set forth in the regulations, covering its facilities and operations pursuant
to its right-of-way permit.  The municipality shall be named as an additional
insured on such policy.
   (c)   Such regulations shall provide that upon the written application of a
permittee and approval of the Administrator, City Attorney and City Treasurer,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, Permittees who maintain a
net book value in excess of ten million dollars ($10,000,000) may self-insure
in lieu of providing policies of insurance.
(Ord. 06-2007. Passed 5-3-07.)
1010.12  REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.

permittee that intends to discontinue use of and abandon any facilities located
above ground in the rights of way shall remove such facilities from the rights-
of-way within ninety days of discontinuation of use. Any forced abandonment of
public-utility facilities will be under taken consistent with state law. A
permittee with facilities located underground in the rights-of-way may abandon
such facilities in place so long as the permittee takes all action necessary to
ensure that such facilities do not constitute a public health or safety hazard
and, to extent a permit is not required by
Chapter 1020, the permittee notifies the municipality in writing of its
abandonment of the facilities within ninety days and the action taken to
abandon the underground facilities. 
   (b)   Should any permittee fail, after notice, to remove or rearrange
facilities at the Administrator's request as specified in Section
1010.06(A)(4) or comply with the provisions of Section
1010.12(A), the municipality may, at its option and in addition to the
imposition of any penalties or other remedies hereunder, undertake or cause to
be undertaken, any reasonable action necessary to remove, secure, or rearrange
the facilities, after proper appeal to the Right-of-Way Committee has been
made. The city may not take any unilateral action until such time as the Right-
of-Way Committee hears the appeal and makes its ruling.  The municipality shall
have no liability for any damage caused by such action and the permittee shall
be liable to the municipality for all reasonable costs incurred by the
municipality in such action.
(Ord. 06-2007. Passed 5-3-07.)
1010.13  REVOCATION.
   (a)   In addition to any other rights set out in this chapter, the
municipality reserves the right to revoke, in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section
1010.13(B), any right-of-way permit in the event such permittee violates any
material provision of this chapter or its right-of-way permit.
   (b)   The Administrator shall give a permittee thirty days prior written
notice of intent to revoke said permittee's right-of-way permit.  Such notice
shall state the reasons for such action.  If the Permittee cures the violation
or other cause within the thirty day notice period, or if the permittee
initiates efforts satisfactory to the Administrator to remedy the stated
violation, the Administrator may rescind said notice of revocation.  If the
permittee does not cure the stated violation or other cause or undertake
efforts satisfactory to the Administrator to remedy the stated violation the
Administrator may recommend said permit be revoked.  After granting the
permittee an opportunity to be heard in person or in writing, the Right-of-Way
Committee may revoke the right-of-way permit. Unless otherwise required by law,
the decision of the Right-of-Way Committee shall be final.
   (c)   Unless otherwise permitted by the Administrator or required by law, if
a right-of-way permit is revoked, all facilities located in the rights-of-way
or located upon public property pursuant to such permit shall be removed at the
sole expense of the permittee.
(Ord. 06-2007. Passed 5-3-07.)

or interest in any right-of-way or public property other than that explicitly
set forth herein or in a permit.

from constructing, maintaining, repairing or relocating any non-proprietary
municipality utility, including street lighting, communications or like
facilities; grading, paving, maintaining, repairing, relocating or altering any
street, public property or right-of-way; or constructing, maintaining,
relocating, or repairing any sidewalk or other public work or improvement.  To
the extent that such work requires temporary or permanent relocation or
rearrangement of any facilities or structures of any permittee, such relocating
or rearrangement shall be accomplished at the sole cost of the permittee in
such time and in such manner as set forth in the regulations, except for re-
location costs purely aesthetic/beautification projects, for example.

permittee's wires, cables, poles, or other facilities placed pursuant to this
chapter, in order to lawfully move a large object, vehicle, building or other
structure over the streets of the municipality, upon four weeks written notice
by the Administrator to the permittee, the permittee shall, at the expense of
the person requesting the temporary removal of such facilities, comply with
Administrator's request; provided that the permittee's expense has been
reasonably secured by the person so requesting.

that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the
point at which the building sewer is connected.
(Ord. 12-77. Passed 5-5-77.)
1040.32  SPECIAL AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS.
   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the City and any industrial concern
whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by
the City for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern.
Any such agreement or arrangement shall, as a minimum, set charges at the
billing rate for normal strength sewage and shall be consistent with the rates
and surcharges established by Section

   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged into
the public sewers, which waters or wastes contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in this section, and which in the judgment of the
Health Officer or City Manager may interfere with, pass through or otherwise be
incompatible with the wastewater facilities, processes, equipment or receiving
waters, or which otherwise may create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the Health Officer or City Manager may do any of the following:
   (a)   Prohibit discharge of the wastes into the public sewer;
   (b)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge into the
public sewers;
   (c)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; or
   (d)   Require payment to cover added cost of handling and treating the

   (e)   Any person responsible for the payment of a tap-in fee under this
section may enter into a contract with the City for payment by installments
over a five-year period of the tap-in fee or unpaid portion thereof. The
faithful performance by the person responsible for the payment of the tap-in
fee under the contract shall be secured by a mortgage on the real estate for
which the tap-in permit is issued, with the City as mortgagee, which need not
be a first lien on the real estate. Such deferred tap-in charges shall bear a
fixed rate of interest on the unpaid balance, based on the Prime Lending Rate
as established by the United States Federal Reserve (Federal Open Market
Committee, FOMC).  The cost of recording the mortgage shall be paid by the
mortgagor.

trunk sewer immediately north of Edgewood Drive and West State Street in the
west area of the City and called the West Trenton Sanitary Trunk Sewer. The fee
shall be collected prior to the issuance of a use permit.
   The tap-in fee shall apply to all users of the system north of sanitary
manhole 1 at Station 0+32 as set forth on page two of the six page West Trenton
Plan and Profile Phase 2 as prepared by RW Consultants and dated November 22,
1991, except those now existing who have previously paid all applicable tap-in
fees.
   The special tap-in fees collected shall be returned to the funds from which
the costs were advanced and charged until such time as the City has been fully
reimbursed.

RATES AND METERS
1040.37  RENTAL FOR SEWERAGE SERVICES.
   It is hereby determined and declared to be necessary and conducive to the
protection of the public health, safety, welfare and convenience of the City to
levy and collect service charges or sewer rentals upon all occupied premises,
served by, having connection with or having access to the sanitary sewerage
system and the Sewage Treatment Plant of the City. The proceeds of such charges
or rentals so derived shall be for the use of the sanitary sewerage system and
Treatment Plant as provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 12-77. Passed 5-5-77.)
1040.38  CREDIT FOR WATER NOT DISCHARGED TO SEWERAGE SYSTEM.
   (a)   Generally. The charge for sewer service shall be based on the volume
of water delivered to the customer wherever and whenever this information is
available. Since water used for lawn sprinkling, car washing, filling swimming
pools, etc., does not normally enter the sanitary sewerage system, it is
considered to be appropriate and reasonable to make certain allowances for
these nonsewerage volumes. 
   (b)   Wastewater Volume Measurements (Residential Customers Only).
      (1)   Nonsummer period (November through April). Sewer billings will be
based on the actual recorded volume of water delivered to the customer.
      (2)   Summer period (May through October). Sewer billings will be based
on the lesser of either the actual recorded volume of water delivered to the
customer or the highest recorded monthly usage during the previous nonsummer
period.
   (c)   Exceptions.
      (1)   In the case of a new customer or change of ownership, where
previous usage patterns are not available, the maximum volume for sewer billing
will be 8,000 gallons per month for the summer period.
      (2)   If the highest recorded monthly water usage during the previous
nonsummer period is proven to be nonrepresentative due to a verified water
leak, etc., the second highest recorded usage will be used.
      (3)   If water used for nonsewer purposes is separately metered, through
a meter furnished by the City at the owner's expense, the sewer billings will
be based on the recorded volume discharged to the sewerage system.
      (4)   Institutional, commercial and industrial customers desiring credit
or allowance on their sewer billings for water not discharged to the sewerage
system will be required to provide separate meters, furnished by the City at
the owner's expense, for measuring these nonsewerage volumes.
(Ord. 8-88. Passed 5-19-88.)
   (d)   Amount of Credit Allowance. Credit for nonsewerage volumes allowed
under this section shall be based upon the current rate being charged to the
City by the Board of County Commissioners for treatment at the regional
treatment facility, except that the rate for water used for nonsewer purposes
that is metered separately shall be based upon the current rate being charged
under Section
1040.40 (a)(3).
(Ord. 10-88. Passed 8-4-88; Ord. 08-2012.  Passed 4-19-12.)
1040.39  SEWER REVENUE FUND.
   The funds received from the collection of sewer service rates and charges
shall be deposited with the Treasurer and kept by him in a separate and
distinct fund known as the Sewer Revenue Fund. This Fund shall be used for the
payment of the cost of the management, construction, maintenance, debt service,
operation, design, improvement and expansion of the sewerage system and Sewage
Treatment Plant.
(Ord. 12-77. Passed 5-5-77.)
1040.40  SEWER SERVICE CHARGES WITHIN CITY.
   There is hereby levied and assessed upon each premises having any sewer
connection with or having access to the sanitary sewerage system of the City,
or otherwise discharging sewage or industrial wastes into the system, a sewer
service charge or rental, payable as hereinafter provided and in an amount
determinable for all users of the City sanitary sewerage system, except as
otherwise provided in this chapter.
   The rate shall be as follows:
   (a)   Nonindustrial Users. Nonindustrial users shall pay the following
monthly charges, effective the first day of January of the identified year.

2,000 or more $4.00 $4.14
 
      (1)   On January 1, 2011 and on that date each year thereafter, the
monthly minimum charges and consumption rates shall be increased at the greater
of either the rate of inflation as determined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
annual increase as of the most recent month reported for the previous year; or,
the rate of increase assessed or to be assessed by the Butler County Department
of Environmental Services, or their successor agency, in the current or
succeeding year.  The rates to be charged to volume industrial or commercial
users may be established by special schedules or contracts to be determined by
Council.
      (2)   A user who is 65 years of age or older or is permanently and
totally disabled, and who qualifies for a 60% or greater reduction of taxable
value under Ohio R.C. 323.152, shall be entitled to a reduction of three
dollars and twenty cents ($3.20) on the minimum charge for any month that the
user uses 2,000 gallons or less, after the Treasurer has approved the user’s
application for such a reduction. Each user applying for a reduction shall
renew his or her application annually with the Treasurer.
   (b)   Industrial Users. It is hereby determined that all receipts of
wastewater treatment service on the effective date of Ordinance 12-77, passed
May 5, 1977, are classified as nonindustrial users. In the future, should any
industrial user utilize any grant-funded facility, the City shall, in
accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part 35, as amended, enact the necessary industrial
cost recovery system legislation.

sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the City’s sewerage
system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by the City,
and the quantity of water used is measured by a water meter acceptable to the
City Manager, then, in each such case, the quantity of water used, as measured
by such meter, shall be used to determine the sewer service charge or rental as
provided in this chapter.
   (b)   Master meters are required for duplex, triplex, quadplex, and multi-
family units.  Those charges are to be payable monthly by the owner of the
property.

sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by
the City and the quantity of water used is not measured by a water meter or is
measured by a water meter not acceptable to the City Manager, then, in each
case, the owner or other interested party shall, at his own expense, install
and maintain a water meter acceptable to the City Manager, and the quantity of

sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by
the City and in addition uses water from another source which is not measured
by a water meter or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the City
Manager, then in each such case the owner or other interested party shall, at
his expense, install and maintain water meters satisfactory to the City Manager
on all supplies, and the quantity of water used to determine the sewer service

sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is an industry and it can be
shown, to the satisfaction of the City Manager, that a portion of the water, as
measured by the water meter or meters, does not and cannot enter the sewerage
system, the City Manager may determine in such manner and by such method as he
may find practical, the percentage of metered water entering the sewerage
system, and the quantity of water used to determine the sewer charge or rental
shall be that percentage, so determined, of the quantity of water measured by
the water meter or meters.

1044.01  BYLAWS AND REGULATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION OF WATERWORKS.
   (a)   Rules and Regulations Part of Contract. The following rules and
regulations are to be considered a part of the contract between the City
waterworks and all users of water.
   (b)   Inspections. Members or employees of the Water Division are hereby
authorized to enter and have free access, at all reasonable times, to any
premises supplied with water, where it is necessary to ascertain the condition
of any pipes or fixtures attached to the waterworks.
   (c)   Connection to Waterworks; Application; Effect. All property owners in
the City of Trenton desirous of water service shall connect to the City of
Trenton waterworks system. Private wells will not be permitted within City
limits.  No property owner desiring the supply of water shall fail to make
application to the Division for the service pipe and connections with the
mains. Such application shall be made in writing and must be signed by the
owner of the property or his duly authorized agent, with the distinct
understanding that the applicant agrees to abide by the Rules and Regulations
heretofore or hereafter adopted by the Division, and that the property is to be
held liable for all water rates accrued or which will accrue against it. The
turning on of water at any premises means that the applicant has agreed to
comply with the rules and regulations.
(Ord. 833. Passed 5-20-69.)
   (d)   Financial Responsibility. The owner of private property that is served
by the waterworks system, as well as the lessee or tenant of the premises,
shall be liable jointly or severally to the City for all the charges herein
levied. All unpaid accounts for water shall be a lien against the property
furnished, and if water rent is not paid when due, the water shall be turned
off at the curb cock, and before service is resumed, patrons shall pay a
resumption fee of seventy dollars ($70.00) for same day resumption, or thirty
dollars ($30.00) for next day resumption, for the services of turning water off
and on between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., and seventy dollars
($70.00) if paid any other time, and shall pay the amount of all water rent
due.  Additionally, for water service turned off for reason of non-payment,
resumption fees will increase thirty dollars ($30.00) for a second resumption
for same day, next day, or after hours resumption if within a 12-month calendar
year period.  Said resumption fees shall be capped at one increased fee of
thirty dollars ($30.00) in addition to one prior resumption fee if within the
12-month calendar year period.
(Ord. 14-94. Passed 8-4-94; Ord. 07-2014.  Passed 5-15-14.)
   (e)   Taking Water for Private Use. No person shall take water for private
use from any public building, public or private watering trough or fountain,
hydrant, draw cock or hose pipe, except for fire purposes, or in any way take
water for private use which is supplied by the waterworks, without first paying
for the same, and receiving a permit from the Service Director. In case any
damage to a street hydrant is done by a permittee while taking water, the
permittee shall pay such damages and expenses as may be incurred.
   (f)   Discontinuance and Resumption of Service. No property owner wishing to
discontinue the use of water shall fail to give proper notice thereof to the
Treasurer, or pay the full rate for the current term. No rebates shall be
allowed for vacancy for a period less than three months, and the water must be
turned off at the curb.  In the event that a property owner or user requests
their water to be turned on or off for short-term emergencies, and said request
does not occur between 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. any day except weekends,
holidays, or other non-working days, there shall be a charge equal to the
largest fee identified in Section
1044.03(c).  Said fee shall be payable at the time of service or shall become
due and payable on the property’s subsequent utility bill.  There shall be no
charge for requests made between 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. any day except
weekends, holidays, or other non-working days.
   (g)   Refunds. No refund of water rent shall be allowed by reason of
removal, disuse, diminished use or vacant premises, unless notice thereof is
left at the office of the Treasurer at the time such change takes place.
Amounts of less than three dollars ($3.00) will not be refunded or collected.
(Adopting Ordinance)
   (h)   Fire Alarms. Upon the alarm of fire, all sprinkling and other
unnecessary uses of water shall be stopped immediately and remain so until the
fire is out. No person shall violate this subsection.
   (i)   Tampering With, Defacing or Injuring Waterworks System. No person
shall remove the cover of any public or private cock, meter box, or valve box,
or place any dirt, stones or other obstructions in such boxes, or commit any
act tending to obstruct the use thereof, or shall in any manner deface or
injure any hydrant, building, machinery, pipe, apparatus, tools or fixtures of
the waterworks.
   (j)   Responsibility of City. The Division does not guarantee the water
delivered as to quality, purity or temperature, these all being subject to the
variable conditions that may arise in the operations and maintenance of the
waterworks, nor does it guarantee any fixed pressure or continuous supply, but
it shall, in case of an accident that causes a shortage or causes the water to
be shut off, endeavor to notify consumers affected thereby. In case no notice
can be given, the Division shall in no manner be held responsible for any
consequences of such shut off. Those using steam boilers and receiving their
supply direct from the mains should have a tank large enough to hold an ample
supply for emergency cases.
(Ord. 833. Passed 5-20-69.)
   (k)   Inspection and Maintenance of Service Lines. Service lines shall be
laid not less than three and one-half feet below the finished grade and at
right angles to the main. Before being backfilled they must be inspected by the
Director. Service lines shall be maintained by the property owner or consumer
from the curb box to and including all property. Whenever a break or leak
occurs in a service line of property, the owner of the property shall have it
repaired immediately.
   (l)   Services Required in Advance of Street Improvements. Where services
are required by an ordinance in advance of street improvements, the Division
shall lay the services at the expense of the property owners and if such cost
is not paid immediately, it must be added to the street improvement assessment.
The cost of the same shall be figured from the center of the street and the
cost of services mentioned in Section
1044.02(b) shall not apply.
   (m)   Connections to Service Lines Previously Installed. Where service lines
have been previously installed, application shall be made to the Treasurer for
a permit to connect to the curb stop. If any holder of a permit, in making an
attachment, does not properly replace the curb box, or carelessly injures the
curb box or any of its parts, or other property of the waterworks, he shall be
charged with the expense of such repairs, the same to be made by the Division.
Upon his failure to report such damage or pay such charges, he shall be refused
further permits until such damages are paid.
   (n)   Installation of Service Lines from Curb Stop to Cellar. Service lines
from the curb stop to the cellar shall be laid at least three and one-half feet
below the finished grade and must be Type K copper tubing or an approved
equivalent not less than three-quarters of an inch inside diameter. Plumbers
may turn water on to test their work, but must shut it off immediately after
such a test. Only in case of emergency, no person except employees of the
waterworks shall turn on or shut off any curb stop, without first receiving
permission. Plumbers shall not loan their curb wrenches to anyone for this
purpose. Before backfilling any ditch, inspection for depth and leaks must be
made by the Director. (Adopting Ordinance)
   (o)   Stop and Waste Cock Required. All service pipes shall be provided with
an improved stop and waste cock where they enter the building, easily
accessible and so installed that the water can be shut off and drained from the
pipes and meter.
   (p)   Meters Required. Meters shall be installed on all services, the size
and kind to be determined by the Division. Master meters are required for
duplex, triplex, quadplex, and multi- family units. Individual shut offs for
each unit will be required. Those charges are to be payable monthly by the
owner of the property.
   (q)   Furnishing and Maintenance of Meters. Meters shall be furnished by the
Division at cost to the consumer. The consumer shall be responsible for all
damages caused by abuse or freeze-up. The Division shall absorb the cost of
repairs from normal wear.
   (r)   Installation and Protection of Meters. Meters shall be installed in
such a manner and place that will make them readily accessible for reading.
They must not be connected directly to the stop and waste cock. Where a meter
is used in connection with a steam or hot water boiler, or under any other
conditions where it is exposed to back pressure of steam or hot water, it
should be protected by a swinging check valve placed between the outlets of the
meter and the boiler or heater so supplied.
   (s)   Meter Reading; Estimated Charges; Termination of Service for Non-
access. The meter reader shall read meters on a monthly, bi-monthly or other
schedule as determined by the City Manager and Treasurer. In any month a meter
is not read, an estimated charge shall be made based upon a percentage of the
most recent reading, as determined by the City Manager and Treasurer. If the
meter reader is unable to procure a reading after two calls because of the
meter being out of order or because he does not have access to it, an estimated
charge may be made, based upon Finance Department evaluation of the account. 
Should free access to the meter not be given within a reasonable time, the
water may be shut off until such access is provided for.
   (t)   Broken or Tampered-with Meter. If the Division finds that a meter seal
has been broken or any by-pass inserted and there is evidence that the meter
has been tampered with, the water shall be shut off at the curb and shall not
be turned on again until the consumer or owner of the premises pays for the
estimated quantity of water that has been used and not registered, plus the
cost to restore the meter to proper working order and any other necessary
expense.
   (u)   State Laws Applicable. The criminal laws of the State provide severe
penalties for tampering with water meters, meter seals, etc., and any person
making a connection on a service line between the water meter and the street
mains, or installing a by-pass around the meter shall be prosecuted according
to the laws of the State. Any plumber or person guilty of violating any such
laws, shall also be refused further permits.
   (v)   Testing of Meters. When the Division is requested to test any meter
for accuracy and such test shows that the meter reads within the legal limits
(2% fast or 3% slow) the consumer shall bear the cost of five dollars ($5.00)
for such service.
   (w)   Alteration of Rules and Regulations. The Division reserves the right
to alter or amend these rules and regulations, and to change the rates for the
use of water, and to make special rates or contracts in any or all cases.
(Ord. 833. Passed 5-20-69; Ord. 14-2004. Passed 5-20-04; Ord. 16-2005.  Passed
6-2-05; Ord. 11-2012.  Passed 5-17-12.)
1044.02  CONNECTION FEES.
   (a)   At the time of application for a building permit for a structure
requiring water service, or at the time of application for water service,
whichever occurs first, a water system connection fee shall be collected from
the applicant in accordance with the schedule set forth in division (b) hereof.
   (b)   Water system connection fees shall be computed on the basis of
Equivalent Residential Units (ERUs) plus costs incurred by the City as a result
of the connection.
      (1)   One ERU is defined as the average water capacity requirements for a
detached single-family dwelling. All uses other than single-family dwellings
shall be expressed in fractions or multiples of one ERU, utilizing the table of
ERUs for typical uses as it appears in Section
1040.36 as a guideline. 
(Ord. 982.  Passed 8-7-75.)
      (2)   The fee shall be two thousand dollars ($2,000)  per ERU, plus the
most current cost of the required meter fittings, corporation stop,
appurtenances thereto, and any costs incurred by the City for materials or
labor pertaining to the installation, inspection or tapping involved. Such ERU
classification, and additional costs to be determined by the Service Director
under the supervision of the City Manager in compliance with such guidelines.

   On January 1, 2017, and on that date each year thereafter, the monthly
minimum charges and  consumption rates shall be increased at the rate of
inflation as determined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) annual increase as
determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of
the most recent month reported for the previous year. The rates to be charged

(a) hereof shall be included on the January combined utility bills of the
identified year, and shall be payable monthly at the Utilities Office of the
City and shall be billed to and paid by the users contemporaneously with the
sewer bills. Such charges shall be due and payable within 15 days after
billing. In case of failure to pay any bill for water charges when due, a
penalty of 10% of such charge shall be added to such bill. Such charges are
minimum charges, not maximum charges, and the City reserves the right and is
obligated to increase the same at any time should the revenue of the system

   (c)   Should the bill rendered to any property or user served by the
waterworks system remain unpaid for a period of 30 days, water and sewer
service to such property or user shall thereupon be suspended and shall only be
resumed if the property owner or user is present at the time of resumption and
only after proof of payment of a resumption fee is provided to the City’s
Service Department representative at the time of resumption. Said resumption
fee shall be seventy dollars ($70.00) for same day resumption, or thirty
dollars ($30.00) for next day resumption, if paid between 8:00 a.m. and 3:00
p.m. any day except weekends, holidays, or other non-working day. If paid any
other time, the resumption fee shall be seventy dollars ($70.00). Additionally,

property divided by 3,000, or Residential/AW Minimum Charge, whichever is
greater

Monthly ERU times 15, or if property is less than 1 acre in size: use Monthly
Residential Charge calculation.

(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02.)
1206.02  SUBDIVISION DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION.
   (a)   Subdivision Defined.
      (1)   A.   Ohio R.C. 711.001, specifically defines a "Subdivision" as:
The division of any parcel of land shown as a unit or as contiguous units on
the last preceding tax roll, into 2 or more parcels, sites, or lots, any one of
which is less than 5 acres for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of
transfer of ownership, provided however, the division or partition of land into
parcels of more than 5 acres not involving any new streets or easement of
access, and the sale or exchange of parcels between adjoining lot owners, where
such sale or exchange does not create additional building sites, shall be
exempted; or
         B.   The improvement of 1 or more parcels of land for residential,
commercial, or industrial structures or groups of structures involving the
division or allocation of land for the opening, widening or extension of any
streets, except private streets serving industrial structures; the division or
allocation of land as open spaces for common use by owners, occupants or lease
holders or as easements for the extension and maintenance of public sewer,
water, storm drainage or other public facilities.
      (2)   Division (a)(1)A. of the above definition refers to two types of
land subdivision, in which no improvements are required:  "minor subdivisions,"
also known as "lot splits" or "cut-up," and "platted subdivisions." also known
as "final plat subdivisions."  It is noteworthy that all subdivisions of land
in Ohio are deemed platted subdivisions except:
         A.   The division of land into parcels 5 acres or more in size that
does not involve the creation of new dedicated streets or public easements of
access; or
         B.   The transfer of parcels of land between adjoining property owners
where additional building sites are not created; or
         C.   The division of parcels that meet current zoning and involves the
creation of fewer than 5 lots. Procedures for creating these divisions can be
found in Section
1206.03.
      (3)   Division (a)(1)B. of the above definition refers to "platted
subdivisions" in which improvements are required.  Note that actual division of
land is not a prerequisite for qualifications as a subdivision. Any improvement
of land for residential, commercial, or industrial purposes that involves the
allocation of land for new public streets is legally a subdivision in the State
of Ohio.
   (b)   The Ohio General Assembly has recognized the need for simple
conveyance of property division in a limited number of instances. Ohio R.C.
711.31 permits the division of a parcel of land along an existing public
street, not involving the opening, widening or extension of any street or road,
and involving no more than 5 lots after the original tract has been completely
subdivided to be submitted to the City, exercising subdivision approval
authority for approval without a plat. If City staff is satisfied that such
proposed division is not contrary to applicable platting, subdividing, or
zoning regulations, it shall approve such proposed division and on the
presentation of a conveyance of said parcel, shall stamp the words "Approved by
City of Trenton, no plat required" and have it signed by the City's Clerk,
Secretary or other official as may be designated by it. Such authority may
require the submission of a plat of survey and such other information as its
determination thereunder. This method of subdivision of land is known as "lot
splitting" and is often called a "minor subdivision"  or a "lot split."
(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02.)
1206.03  SUBDIVISIONS INVOLVING 5 OR FEWER LOTS; MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (a)   Submission Authorized.  When a proposed subdivision of land involves
no more than 5 lots and does not require the opening, widening or extension of
any street, it may be submitted to the Planning Commission for approval without
a plat, provided, however, that a cumulative total of no more than 5 lots shall
be permitted on one parcel of land without a plat.
   (b)   Requirements for Submission.
      (1)   Drawing and legal description .  A drawing based upon a survey
showing the location of the property and giving dimension and other such
information as may be necessary, and a legal description in writing must be
submitted with the request.
      (2)   Right-of-way conveyance.  When the existing street right-of-way
width is inadequate, a right-of-way conveyance by deed shall be made by the
owner to satisfy the deficiency. Such dedication shall be made to the City when
the subdivision land is located within the corporate limits.
   (c)   Procedure for Approval.  Upon receipt of the drawing, legal
description and right-of-way conveyance (if required), the Planning Commission
shall determine to its satisfaction that the proposed lot split is not contrary
to any applicable platting.
(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02.)
1206.04  ITEMS TO BE CONTAINED ON THE PLAT OF SURVEY FOR MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.

   Upon receipt of the recommendations from advisory staff and commenting
agencies the Planning Commission shall either approve or deny the final plat. 
The approval of the final or record plat by the Planning Commission shall not
constitute a dedication or acceptance of any proposed street right-of-way shown
on the plat.  If the Planning Commission approves the final plat, the record
plat must be submitted for approval to City Council. City Council shall have
responsibility for approving the dedication of the land for street right-of-way
purposes. If the Planning Commission denies the plat, then a revised final plat
must be re-submitted to the Planning Commission for final approval.
(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02.)
1206.20  PROCESSING AND REVIEW FEES FOR FINAL PLAT.

City Engineer and the Clerk of Council.
(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02.)
1206.23  RECORDING PROCEDURES.
   Upon approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission and the City
Council, the plat shall go through the following procedures:
   (a)   The developer forwards the plat to the County Plat Department, where
the lots are assigned permanent parcel numbers and the lots are added to the
County Map System;
   (b)   The County Plat Department forwards the plat to the County Auditor's

(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02.)
CHAPTER 1208
Preliminary Subdivision Plat Requirements
1208.01   General statement.
1208.02   Common open space.
1208.03   Traffic impact analysis.
1208.04   Lots.
1208.05   Information to be contained on the preliminary plat.
1208.06   Preliminary drainage.
1208.01  GENERAL STATEMENT.
   (a)   All regulations in this chapter shall control the general manner in
which streets, lots and other elements of a subdivision are arranged on the
land. These regulations shall help ensure the development of convenient and
safe streets, the creation of usable lots, the provision of space for public
utilities, and the reservation of land for recreational uses. The planning of
attractive and functional neighborhoods shall be promoted in order to minimize
the undesirable features of unplanned, haphazard growth.
   (b)   Subdivisions are encouraged to take advantage of the topography of the
land, minimize the destruction of large trees as well as tree clusters,
minimize the disturbance of topsoil, and preserve such natural features as
watercourses, sites of historical and archaeological significance, and any
other assets that, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the
subdivision and community.
   (c)   The Subdivision Review Committee and the Planning Commission have the
responsibility for reviewing the design of all future subdivisions early in
their design development. The subdivision review staff is also responsible for
making sure that existing roads have the capacity to handle all new development
in a safe and efficient manner. If the City Planning Commission and subdivision
review staff, including the City's Service Director and Chief of Police,
determine that it is in the public interest, they may require a traffic impact
analysis to be completed at the developers' expense. Any street improvements
called for by this analysis which are the direct result of the proposed
development shall also be made at the developers' expense.
   (d)   All land to be subdivided must be submitted for approval all at one
time so that the Planning Commission may better understand the full impacts of
the proposed development and how the entire development relates to and impacts
the City.  Furthermore, the Planning Commission needs to be able to see all
utilities and proposed utilities in the entire area and how they may impact
adjacent pieces of property.
(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02.)
1208.02  COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   (a)   The subdivision layout shall conform to the City's Master Plan, Zoning
Code and any other officially adopted long-range plans for the City.
   (b)   Where deemed appropriate by the Planning Commission, open space
consisting of 3% of total acreage proposed for development, which is suitably
located for future use as parks, playgrounds, and/or other recreational
purposes for local or neighborhood use, shall be provided for in the proposed
subdivision. If such open space is not dedicated to the City, it shall be
reserved for the common use of all property owners in the proposed subdivision
by covenant in individual deeds. Such open space shall be maintained and
operated by the Homeowners or Property Owners Association.
(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02.)
1208.03  TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS.
   (a)   Traffic impact studies (TIS) can be a valuable planning tool for the
City.  A traffic impact study allows the City to better understand the impact a
proposed development will have on adjacent roads, intersections, and site
access driveways before the Planning Commission or City Council approves the
development. This type of planning provides the ability to make modifications
to the proposed plans and/or plan for the mitigation of the traffic impact
prior to the development being constructed.
   (b)   Important questions that may be answered by a traffic impact study:
      (1)   Are the number of access points the minimal necessary to serve the
project without negatively impacting the flow of traffic along arterial
streets?
      (2)   Are the proposed access points a sufficient distance from
intersections to minimize conflicts?
      (3)   Are proposed access points adequately spaced from other access
points along the street?
      (4)   Should left turns be restricted by signs, channeled driveways, or
the installation of a median?
      (5)   Have other methods of access, such as shared driveways, frontage
roads or access off a side street been evaluated?
      (6)   Is the sight distance adequate at proposed access points?
      (7)   Are deceleration lanes necessary?
      (8)   Is the throat length at the driveway sufficient to minimize
conflicts within the site?
      (9)   Can trucks and waste-hauling vehicles easily access the site and
circulate to and from loading areas?
      (10)   Is the design sensitive to pedestrian needs?
   (c)   The traffic impact study guidelines presented in this section will
perform the following functions:
      (1)   Establish standards of study;
      (2)   Ensure that important traffic concerns are addressed;
      (3)   Provide staff with a check list for the review process;
      (4)   Promote an increased understanding of traffic impact issues for
those involved in the development process.
   (d)   A full or partial traffic impact study will be required for any
proposed development when the Planning Commission has determined, after
receiving input from the subdivision review staff, that street capacity and/or
safety are concerns, or when a proposed development will generate 100 or more
added new peak hour trips to or from the site during the adjacent roadway's
peak hours or the development's peak hour.
   (e)   The use of the 100-vehicle threshold is reasonable because in an hour
an additional 100 vehicles can:
      (1)   Change the level of service at an intersection;
      (2)   Require the addition of turn lanes to accommodate site traffic
while not impacting through traffic;
      (3)   Lead to a need for additional traffic control measures such as stop
signs, blinking lights, and/or traffic signalization;
      (4)   For residential developments, 100 peak hour traffic trips are
likely to be generated by:
         A.   150 single-family detached homes;
         B.   245 apartments;
         C.   295 town home condominiums.
      (5)   For commercial development, 100 peak hour traffic trips are likely
to be generated by:
         A.   A 15,000 square foot shopping center;
         B.   A 37,000 square foot medical/dental office;
         C.   A 55,000 square foot general office building;
         D.   A 115,000 square foot light industrial use;
         E.   A 250,000 square foot manufacturing use;
         F.   An 85,000 square foot research and development facility;
         G.   A 4,400 square foot bank with drive-throughs;
         H.   A convenience store with 5 gasoline pumps; and
         I.   A 5,200 square foot restaurant with a drive-through window.
   (f)   In some cases, a proposed development may generate fewer trips than
the threshold indicated above, but a safety or capacity issue in the area of
the proposed development may require a full or partial impact study for the
following reasons:

1210.01  GENERAL STATEMENT.
   (a)   It is recognized that matters of engineering design cannot always be
identified in writing to cover all situations. However, the design standards
established herein represent what is believed to be good engineering practice.
   (b)   Subdivision streets are to be designed to encourage operating speeds
of approximately 25 miles per hour. If a street has been stubbed to the
property to be developed, those streets must be continued into the proposed
development from that point. The Planning Commission has the right to accept,
deny or require that a road be connected to an existing road if it is deemed to
be in the public interest.
   (c)   The Planning Commission, acting upon a written recommendation from the
City's consulting engineer, shall have the authority to modify any engineering
or construction detail, whenever required, for the protection of the public
interest. Afterwards, it shall be the Planning Commission's responsibility to
determine if these Subdivision Regulations need to be amended.
(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02.)
1210.02  STREET DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   The street layout pattern of a proposed subdivision shall be in
general conformity with a plan for the most advantageous development of
adjoining areas and the entire neighborhood. Furthermore, it shall be
consistent with the city's adopted Thoroughfare Plan, and, shall implement to a
high degree the standards identified in the City's adopted Master Plan.
      (1)   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, such
extension is not necessary or desirable. Streets shall be in alignment with
existing planned or platted streets with which they are to connect.
      (2)   Cul-de-sac streets shall generally serve fewer than 20 lots. No
subdivision consisting of 10 or more acres shall be approved solely with a cul-
de-sac street system.
      (3)   Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right
angles as topography and other factors of good design permit.
      (4)   Access control along major thoroughfares shall be taken into
consideration in the design of a subdivision plat.
      (5)   Residential developments abutting arterials or collectors shall be
platted in such a manner as to buffer the impact of the heavily traveled
arterial or collector. Fronting lots on arterials or collector streets are
discouraged and will generally only be approved if there is some special
feature of the land to be subdivided.
      (6)   Lots which will require the backs of homes to face a street shall
be discouraged. However, such lots may be approved if they are screened from
the adjacent street by approximately 12 to 15-foot wide buffer which is not
less than 4 or more than 6 feet in height.
      (7)   A.   Furthermore, such buffers as are set forth in division (A(6)
of this section shall be planted with clusters of trees, of which a minimum of
70 to 75% must be evergreens. The Planning Commission may choose to reduce the
aforementioned height requirement by one-half if the width of the buffer is
increased by 8 to 10 feet and minimum evergreen tree planting requirements
apply.
         B.   Berm evergreens shall be offset, and generally planted not less
than 20 feet on center. Evergreens shall have a minimum planted height of 8
feet. All trees, evergreen as well as deciduous, shall carry a 2-year warranty
for replacement. In order to prevent soil erosion, all berms must be sodded at
the time of tree planting. When deemed necessary by the Planning Commission, an
automatic irrigation system must be installed. In order to prevent sight
problems for motorists, no evergreen or dense deciduous trees shall be planted
within 30 feet of an intersection.
         C.   At least 2 species of evergreens shall be planted in every berm
as a means of minimizing the amount of tree mortality at any one time. Unless
otherwise agreed to by the Planning Commission, the use of white pines shall
constitute a minority of such plantings, due to the fact that they are not well
suited to the multitude of weather influences found in the Trenton area.
      (8)   Public utilities shall not be installed under private streets,
unless approved by the Service Director and Planning Commission and located
within an appropriate easement.
      (9)   Sidewalks of not less than 4 feet in width shall be provided on
both sides of all newly dedicated streets where a net density of 2 or more
dwelling units per acre has been approved.  Sidewalk improvements shall also be
required in all commercial and industrial subdivisions. Curb ramps that comply
with all ADA and other Federal and State regulations are to be provided at the
intersection of all sidewalks and all streets, as well as all T-intersecting
streets. All sidewalks and curb ramps are to be constructed as per typical
construction detail. Refer to Appendix C for detailed drawings.
      (10)   In order to provide better access to schools and business
districts, subdivisions that abut existing thoroughfares or collectors shall
provide sidewalks along the thoroughfare or collector for the full distance of
the development.
      (11)   Interconnecting streets shall be promoted in relatively flat areas
and in all areas adjacent to neighborhoods already exhibiting such a street
system.
      (12)   Public access easements may be required for private streets
serving more than 1 occupant.
   (b)   Where a newly constructed street will extend an existing street,
serious consideration should be given to extending the existing street name,
rather than assigning a different name to the new section.  Otherwise, names of
new streets shall not duplicate or resemble existing street names. All new
streets shall be named in accord with the following schedule:
 
General Direction of Street Ending of Name
North and south             Avenue
East and west               Street
Diagonal                    Road

Cul-de-sac, north and south Place
Cul-de-sac, east and west   Court
Circular or part thereof    Circle
 
   (c)   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, construction and
location of all streets shall conform to adopted subdivision standards
established herein. All street design shall be done in accordance with the
current Ohio Department of Transportation Location and Design Manual and the
American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials Green Book.
      (1)   Temporary dead-end streets shall be permitted where necessitated by
the design of the subdivision, provided that a temporary turnaround shall be
constructed where lots are fronting on such temporary dead-end streets. In such
instances, the turnaround shall have a pavement radius of not less than 40
feet.
      (2)   The grades of new streets shall not be less than 0.5% and shall not
exceed 12%.
      (3)   All changes in street grades above 1%  shall be connected by
vertical curves of a minimum length of 50 feet.
      (4)   All streets to be constructed or improved by a subdivider shall
have curb and gutter, unless an exception is approved by the Planning
Commission for good cause.
      (5)   Where a street ends at a subdivision line for future extension, it
shall be provided with a temporary turnaround using the standard identified in
division (c)(1) of this section until such extensions is completed.
      (6)   The dedication of half or partial streets shall not be permitted
except when a half or partial street exists adjacent to the tract to be
subdivided, and a partial dedication will complete or supplement the existing
street or street right-of-way.
   (d)   Streets shall be designed using the standards identified in Appendix
B.
(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02; Ord. 22-2004. Passed 8-19-04.)
1210.03  INTERSECTIONS.
   (a)   Streets shall intersect at right angles wherever possible and
practicable. No intersection of streets at angles less than 60 degrees shall be

permitted.
   (f)   All changes in grades above 1% shall be connected by vertical curves
of a minimum length of 50 feet or of 15 times the algebraic difference of the
change in grade, whichever is the largest.
(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02.)
1210.04  EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Where feasible, easements for electric and gas utilities shall be
located along other lot lines and, where necessary, along side lot lines.
   (b)   Easements shall normally be 10 feet in width, with 5 feet on each side
of the lot line. Greater widths may be required if necessitated by unusual
circumstances.
(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02.)
1210.05  CONSTRUCTION PLANS.
   (a)   Standard Drawings.  As identified in Appendix C, standards and
specifications for the City show the details of improvements that are
frequently used. Otherwise, Butler County Standard Drawings shall be used for

(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02.)
1210.06  FINAL DRAINAGE PLAN.
   A final drainage plan shall be prepared consistent with the following
criteria:
   (a)   Minor System Design.
      (1)   General.  The minor system design shall be based on a post
development 10-year storm. This system includes all closed conduits, open
channels, inlets, manholes and all features designed to collect storm water
from streets and lots, including the necessary piping for the collection of
sump pump drains. The Rational Method will normally be used when calculating
peak rate of runoff in determining conduit size and grade.
      (2)   Hydrologic analysis.  Storm runoff can be calculated using the
Rational Method or the SCS Technical Release 55 Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds (TR55). In cases of large channels, regression equations may be
used. The Rational Method shall not be used for drainage areas greater than 20
acres.
      (3)   Conduit design.
         A.   General.  All conduits are to be designed on a 10-year flowing
full design using the Manning Formula. The minimum diameter shall be 12 inches.
         B.   Material.  Pipe material for culverts and storm sewer shall
comply with current Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) specifications.
         C.   Roughness coefficient (n).  Manufacturer's "n" value plus .004 to
account for bends and junction losses is to be used.
         D.   Velocity.  The allowable velocity in the storm sewer shall not be
less than 2 feet per second or greater than 14 feet per second for corrugated
metal pipe and 20 feet per second for concrete and plastic pipe based on a 10-
year frequency storm.
         E.   Rock channel protection and/or other means must be used when the
outlet velocity is higher than the permissible erodible velocity for the
channel it enters. The outlet velocity is to be checked on a 10-year frequency
storm.
         F.   Cover.  All pipes shall meet the manufacturers minimum
requirements of depth of cover so as to not crush or deform the pipe in any
way.
         G.   All changes in storm sewer, grade, alignment and the intersection
of 2 or more sewers must take place in a manhole or catch basin.
      (4)   Inlets.  The curb inlet shall be spaced a maximum distance of 300
feet from another catch basin or high point. Closer spacing may be necessary if
the capacity of the inlet is less than the flow tributary to the inlet. Curb
inlets shall be placed in a manner such that no storm water shall be permitted
to flow through any intersection.
      (5)   Sump pump lines.  No sump pump lines may be tied to the sanitary
sewer or to the curb. A separate pipe of 4 or 6-inch diameter is to be run
behind the back of the curb and tied into the nearest possible catch basin or
storm manhole.
         A.   Standard "Y's" or "T's" should be installed 10 feet from the
property line on the downhill side of the lot and marked in the field.
Cleanouts should be spaced approximately every 400 feet.
         B.   No downspouts may be tied to the sump line. All downspouts must
be run separately to catch basins or released on splash blocks.
         C.   All sump pumps must be connected to the sump lines provided at
the street.
   (b)   Major System Design.
      (1)   General.  The intent of planning a flood routing system is to
ensure that storm water runoff which exceeds the capacity of the storm sewer
system shall have a route to follow in order to prevent a major loss of
property or life.
         A.   Minimum opening elevations are to be set by the City's consulting
engineer along all 100-year flood routes. These elevations are to be a minimum
of 1 foot above the 100-year floodwater elevation. These elevations are to be
clearly labeled on the plan and record plat.
         B.   Since streets may be used as a routing path, the major system
must be taken into account in the initial design of the development. It shall
be designed in a manner that will direct the storm water into a detention or
retention area.
      (2)   Capacity.  The combination of the major and minor system shall have
the capacity to carry runoff from a 100-year frequency storm.
         A.   Where the street is designed as the major drainageway, the depth
of flow shall not exceed 8 inches at the face of the curb.
         B.   When the major drainageway is located outside a street right-of-
way, such as in a retention pond or detention basin, easements shall be
provided and a grading plan is to be submitted with detailed elevations showing
the flood being contained in this area.
   (c)   Culvert Design.
      (1)   Technical Release 55 and the Hydraulic Circular No. 5, which can be
obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,
are the recommended procedures for design.
      (2)   A single-span culvert should always be used in lieu of a multiple-
span opening. The only time a multiple-opening culvert shall be considered is
when no other single- span structure will function.
      (3)   All culverts that are a part of the major system shall be designed
for the 50-year storm with headwater and a flood route provided to accept a
100-year storm.
      (4)   Maximum allowable headwater:
         A.   18 inches below the top of the curb;
         B.   12 inches  below the edge of the pavement (non-curb and gutter
section).
      (5)   The design of the drainage system shall not cause backwater into
any adjacent property. If additional backwater is caused, an easement from the
affected property owner must be obtained. The backwater condition should be
checked on the 50- year frequency storm.
      (6)   A structure having a clear opening of 10 feet or more shall be
classified as a bridge and subject to special conditions under the direction of
the Service Director or other consultant that the City has hired for
engineering advice.
      (7)   Entrance loss coefficient:  Appropriate standard entrance
coefficients are to be used in culvert design.
   (d)   Open Channel Design.
      (1)   General.  Any newly designed open channel shall only accommodate a
small drainage area (i.e., lot swale). All other design drainage features shall
be enclosed with storm sewer, with the exception of large, major channels.
      (2)   Design.
         A.   Open channels are to be designed using a full flow 10-year
frequency storm unless the channel is part of the major storm system, then it
must be designed using a 100-year storm frequency.
         B.   Special provisions such as a check or drop structure will be
addressed on an individual basis.
         C.   The longitudinal slope of a channel should be 1% or greater. Any
channel with a slope below 1% or with a small continuous flow must have a paved
bottom, or be under drained with a low-flow pipe. All side slopes shall be 4:
1 or flatter in residential areas and 3:1 or flatter in commercial and
industrial areas unless otherwise approved by the City's engineering
consultant.
      (3)   Permissible velocities.  The maximum permissible design velocity
shall not be greater than the erodible velocity of the channel. The velocity is
to be calculated using a bank full condition or a minimum 10-year frequency
storm, whichever is greater. Channel linings will be required as per the ODOT
Design Manual. In designing an open channel, the low flow and grade shall be
addressed as to prevent stagnation. All seeding, mulching and sodding shall be
installed immediately after construction as per ODOT 659 and 660 and kept in
ideal growth conditions until established.
   (e)   Detention and Retention.
      (1)   Introduction.  The objective of a detention/retention facility is
to regulate the rate of runoff and control the peak discharges to reduce the
impact on the downstream drainage system.
      (2)   Design criteria.  The allowable peak rate of runoff from the
developed area shall not exceed a pre-developed 10-year frequency storm. The
basin shall have capacity to store a post-developed 50-year frequency storm
from the same area.
      (3)   Design considerations.  The following considerations for
maintenance and appearance of a detention/retention facility shall be taken
into account in the design:
         A.   The bottom of the detention area should be constructed with
sufficient slopes to drain properly (0.5% minimum).
         B.   Paved gutter or a low flow under drain shall be constructed from
all inlet pipes to the outlet structure. Where two gutters intersect, large
radii shall be used so that the change in direction of flow is gradual.
         C.   Side slopes for detention facilities shall be no steeper than 4:
1 unless existing natural conditions do not make this possible.
         D.   Anti-seep collars shall be used on all pipe outlets of retention
basins or ponds.
         E.   There shall be a minimum of 6 inches of freeboard between the top
of the dike and the water surface in the reservoir with the emergency spillway
flowing at the 100-year design flow.
         F.   The emergency spillway shall safely pass the peak flow for a 100-
year frequency storm with a safe velocity (8.0-fps max). The spillway is to be
cut on existing ground or other protection on the fill slope to be provided.
         G.   A 20-foot access easement shall be provided for easy ingress and
egress to and from the detention or retention basin. This access shall have a
maximum slope of 25%.
         H.   Trash guards should be installed when clogging of the outlet
structure is probable.
         I.   Anti-vortex devices should be used at the top of all riser pipes
in retention ponds.
(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02.)
1210.07  MAINTENANCE OF THE STORM WATER SYSTEM.
   The developer of any subdivision with a storm water system must provide the
Planning Commission with written evidence of a perpetual maintenance agreement
and the manner in which it is to be funded. The maintenance agreement shall be
structured so that all property owners within the subdivision participate in
the maintenance funding of the storm water system. An acceptable method of
maintenance is through an incorporated Homeowners or Property Owners
Association, with the abilities to maintain storm sewer facilities outside the
right-of-way. A copy of the Association's documents shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator for review prior to being recorded.

(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02.)
1212.05  SOIL AND WATER MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   General statement. These regulations establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable standards to achieve a level of subdivision design
and construction to minimize damage to property, degradation of natural
resources, and to promote and maintain the health, safety and general well-
being of all life and inhabitants of the City of Trenton.  Further, these
regulations:
      (1)   Promote development while keeping downstream flooding, erosion and
sedimentation at existing levels;
      (2)   Reduce damage to receiving streams and drainage systems which may
be caused by impairment of their capacity which may be caused by sedimentation.
   (b)   Pre-recording development/construction phases.
      (1)   Performance  standards.
         A.   Permit required. Owner/operator must obtain a Butler County earth
moving permit with construction drawing approval from the Butler County storm
water district before any earth disturbing activity may begin, including
clearing, grubbing, and cut/fill activity unless the proposed project is
regulated by subsection (c)(1), lot erosion and sediment control permit.  All
projects above one acre disturbance must have either an earth moving permit or
a lot erosion and sediment control permit.
         B.   Erosion and sediment control.  To the maximum extent practicable,
having all ESC's from the approved construction drawings installed and
functioning, erosion and sediment is to be kept on development area. Erosion
and sedimentation caused by storm water runoff over the development area due to
earth disturbing activities shall be stabilized and confined to within the
boundaries of the development area.
         C.   Storm water discharges.  The Butler County Storm Water District
has defined allowable storm water discharges per its NPDES Phase II Permit as
described in its Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination Regulations.
         D.   Structural and nonstructural soil and water management.
            1.   Non-structural and structural controls shall be designed in
accordance with requirements and standards specified in these regulations and/
or the current Ohio Environmental Protection Agency permit for storm water
discharges associated with construction activity under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). These practices must also comply with
design standards specified in the City of Trenton Subdivision Regulations.
            2.   Permanent structural and non-structural controls shall be
placed in easements and recorded on the subdivision record plat and/or property
deeds on which they are located and shall remain unaltered unless first
approved by the Butler County Engineers Office. See the City of Trenton
Subdivision Regulations.
            3.   In designing structural controls, access, storage volume,
flood prevention and water quality benefits shall be considered to the maximum
extent practicable to protect life and property.  Refer to the City of Trenton
Subdivision Regulations for additional design criteria.
         E.   Channel protection.
            1.   The owner/operator will protect channels from degradation due
to water run off. Structural or non-structural controls shall be constructed by
the owner/operator as prescribed in the latest edition of Rainwater and Land
Development and/or ODOT Location & Design Manual.
            2.   The design and installation of any storm water channel shall
comply with the City of Trenton Subdivision Regulations.
         F.   Unsuitable soils.
            1.   When a soil with a high water table, as defined in the Butler
County Soil Survey, is present, a note must be placed by the designing engineer
on the final plat stating: “High water table soils are apparent in this area. 
If basements are constructed, it is the responsibility of the builder to take
special precautions to ensure the basement stays dry.”  If this note is not on
the plans as the Butler County Storm Water District is reviewing the plans,
revisions will be required with the note before the plans will be approved.
            2.   Upon review of the construction drawings, if soil type and/or
severity of slopes requires additional testing as determined by the Butler
County Storm Water District, a report from a State Registered geotechnical
engineer will be required.  The report results of surface and subsurface
exploration, conditions of the land, procedures for performing the grading
operations, maximum slope to satisfy stability, and other geotechnical design
requirements for the requested lots will determine if there are problematic
conditions to overcome, what those problematic conditions may be, and possible
solutions to overcome them to protect the home buyer.  This report must be
received and checked by the Butler County Storm Water District so that the
conclusions appear reasonable and credible prior to construction drawing
approval.  The results of this report may warrant additional studies prior to
the building permit being issued due to building code requirements.
            3.   If a hydric soil or soils with hydric components, wetland
vegetation and/or possible hydrologic conditions are present, Butler County
Storm Water District may require a wetland delineation study be done.  A note
shall be placed on the preliminary plat stating "A wetland delineation study
shall be complete for the necessary lots prior to construction drawing
approval."  The delineated wetland boundaries shall be shown on the
construction drawings, final plat and included within an easement on the
property. 
         G.   Temporary soil stabilization of development area due to earth
disturbing activity and soil stockpiles.
            1.   Temporary vegetation shall be established within development
areas subject to earth disturbing activities as specified in Table 1 below.
Table 1: Temporary Soil Stabilization
 
Area Requiring Temporary Vegetation     Time Frame to Apply Temporary
                                        Vegetation

stockpiles, that will be dormant for    disturbance within the area.
more than 21 days but less than one
year.
Disturbed areas that will be idle over  Prior to onset of winter weather.
winter.
 
            2.   Soil stabilization measures should be appropriate for the time
of year, Development Area conditions, and estimated time of use.  Stabilization
methods include vegetation, mulching, and the early application of gravel base
on areas to be paved.
            3.   Topsoil to be stored on development area shall be stabilized
with quick growing plants or other means, so that it is protected from wind and
water erosion.  Topsoil to be redistributed on project site shall be maintained
in a usable condition for sustaining vegetation and reused on the development
area. 
         H.   Permanent soil stabilization of development area due to earth
disturbing activity.
            1.   Permanent vegetation shall be established on development areas
as specified in Table 2 below.
Table 2: Permanent Soil Stabilization
 
Area Requiring Permanent Vegetation  Time Frame to Apply Permanent Vegetation
Any area that will lie dormant for 6 Within 7 days of the most recent
months or more.                      disturbance.
Any area at final grade.             Within 7 days of reaching final grade
                                     within that area.
 
            2.   Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until
a ground cover is achieved which is mature enough to control soil erosion.
         I.   Cut and fill slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed,
constructed, and stabilized in a manner which will minimize erosion. 
Consideration should be given to the length and steepness of the slope, the
soil type, upslope drainage area, groundwater conditions, and other applicable
factors.  If, after final grading, there is excessive erosion, where rill
erosion becomes gully erosion, additional slope stabilizing measures by the
owner, developer, or builder will be required until the problem is corrected.
The following guidelines are provided to aid in developing an adequate design.
            1.   Roughened soil surfaces are generally preferred to smooth
surfaces on slopes.
            2.   Diversions should be constructed at the top of long steep
slopes which have significant drainage areas above the slope.  Diversions or
terraces may also be used to reduce slope length.
            3.   Concentrated storm water should not be allowed to flow down
cut or fill slopes unless contained within an adequate channel, flume or slope
drain structure.
            4.   Wherever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane which
endangers the stability of the slope, adequate drainage or other protection
should be provided.
            5.   Fills of five or more feet located at the proposed primary
structure location and ten feet around the perimeter of the proposed primary
structure should be compacted to densities not less than 98 percent of the
Standard Proctor maximum Dry Density, ASTM D698. All other fill should be
compacted to at least 95 percent Standard Proctor Dry Density ASTM D698. 
Compaction test results shall be submitted and approved by the Butler County
Storm Water District prior to final plat approval.
         J.   Protection of adjacent properties/public right-of-ways. 
Properties, public right-of-ways, and thoroughfares adjacent to the development
area of an earth disturbing activity shall be protected from sediment
deposition.  This may be accomplished by preserving a well-vegetated buffer at
the perimeter of the development area; by installing perimeter controls such as
sediment barriers, filters, dikes, sediment basins; or by a combination of such
measures.
         K.   Erosion and sediment controls (ESC's).
            1.   ESC's shall be used to control erosion and trap sediment on a
development area remaining disturbed for more than fourteen days.  Such
structures may include, but are not limited to, silt fences, mulch berms, storm
drain inlet protection, sediment traps, sediment basins, and diversions or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment basin.  All ESC's must be installed
to function as their designed intent.
            2.   ESC's shall be constructed as a first step in grading and be
made functional before upslope earth disturbing activities take place.  Earthen
ESC's such as dams, dikes, and diversions shall be seeded and mulched as soon
as the installation is complete. ESC's shall be functional throughout the
course of earth disturbing activity and until the development area is
stabilized with permanent vegetation.
            3.   Sheet flow runoff from the development area shall be
intercepted by silt fence, mulch berms or diversions.  Silt fence or mulch
berms shall be placed on a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily
ponding runoff.  As a guideline the relationship between the maximum slope
length above silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in Table 3 below
or a plan of design from a professional engineer may be submitted, which ever
is more appropriate.
Table 3: Maximum Slope Length Above Silt Fence
Drainage Area:

> 50%     >2:1              25
 
            4.   Storm water diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff
away from disturbed areas and steep slopes.  Such devices, which include
swales, dikes, or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten
acres.
            5.   Whenever storm water detention is required per the City of
Trenton Subdivision Regulations, the storm water runoff from the development
area shall pass through a sediment basin or other suitable sediment trapping
facility before discharge to waters of the state. The Butler County Storm Water
District may require sediment basins or traps for smaller disturbed areas where

or after the temporary measures are no longer needed.  Trapped sediment and
other disturbed soil areas resulting from the removal of temporary measures
shall have the final grade re-established and be permanently stabilized to
prevent further erosion and sedimentation.
         P.   Control of construction development area debris and wastes.
            1.   All owners, applicants, contractors, and developers shall
properly dispose of discarded building materials, concrete truck washout,
chemicals, litter, and sanitary waste on the development area in order to keep
streets and gutters clear of all sediment and debris from the development
area.  Any burial pits on site must be shown on the final plat. 
            2.   A defined washout area shall be located within the development
area and protected such that washout does not leave the area. Proper removal
and disposal of the material shall take place upon hardening or drying. See
subsection (f) for sample concrete washout practices.

practices.
            1.   Storm water management practices shall be designed for the
permitted use of the development area and function safely and with minimal
maintenance.
            2.   If an inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of
repair or maintenance because it is failing, with the exception of a sediment
settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three days of the
inspection by owner/operator. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained to the approved construction drawings within ten days of the
inspection owner/operator.
         R.   Inspection of storm water controls/ internal inspections.
            1.   Development area discharge locations shall be inspected to
ascertain whether erosion and sediment control measures are effective in
preventing significant impacts to the maximum extent practicable to the
receiving waters of the state.

least once every 7 calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24-hour period and repaired or
maintained as described in subsection Q. above. The development area owner/
operator shall assign a qualified inspection personnel, experienced in the
installation and maintenance of erosion and runoff controls, to conduct these
inspections to ensure that all storm water control practices are functional,
that all provisions of the SWP3 and this regulation are being met,  and whether
additional control measures are required.
            3.   All ESC's shall be periodically inspected by the developer to
ensure proper function and to identify failures.  If the inspection reveals
that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception
of a sediment settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three
days of the initial inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within 10 days of the inspection.
            4.   The development area owner/operator shall maintain for 3 years
following the final stabilization of the development area a record summarizing
inspections, names(s) and qualifications of personnel making the inspections,
the date(s) of inspections, major observations relating to the implementation

(Ord. 12-2002.  Passed 7-2-02.)
1212.07  OTHER IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Street Tree and Parking Lot Island Planting. 
      (1)   Street tree planting plans shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission for approval, and if approved, such trees shall be planted in
accordance with the provisions of these Subdivision Regulations.
      (2)   Approved street trees shall be planted on each side of every street
within a residential subdivision. Street trees shall be located within the
planting strip and boulevard areas of the public right-of-way. No more than one
street tree per house lot shall be required. Unless otherwise agreed to by the
Planning Commission, street trees shall be located at 75 to 100-foot intervals.
They shall be a minimum planted height of 10 to 12 feet with calipers of at
least 2 inches as measured 4 feet above the approved grade.
      (3)   All street trees shall be clear of branches from the approved grade
area to a point 7 feet above the ground.
      (4)   Trees are a valued addition to the streetscape in the City.
Specifically, they are valued because they provide shade and color, release
oxygen into the air while absorbing carbon dioxide, help muffle noise and
reduce glare, block wind, cool the air, help hold soil in place, enhance the
image of the community, and improve property values.
      (5)   All recommended trees are expected to meet American Association. of
Nurseryman standards for top grade. In addition, in order to assist in
acclimation, trees should, wherever possible, be locally grown.
      (6)   Tree species diversity shall characterize street trees planted in
the City, partly as a means of minimizing the impact of insect infestation or
disease that is host specific to a particular tree species, such as the Dutch
Elm disease which was responsible for killing all American elm trees.
      (7)   Prohibited trees within the public right-of-way shall include
silver maples, catalpas, willows and birches.
      (8)   The best time for planting street and parking lot trees, including
those in boulevards. and along parkways, is in April and May or September,
October and November.  In no instance shall a tree be planted during the hot
summer months of June, July or August, or during any of the winter months. In
all instances, a good grade medium coarse mulch 3 to 5 inches thick shall be
applied, while being careful to keep mulch 6 inches from tree trunks in order
to prevent crown rot.
      (9)   Topping of a street or parking lot tree shall be prohibited because
it reduces the tree's food supply, exposes bark to sun scald, and increases
vulnerability to wind, ice, and insect damage.
      (10)   No street tree shall be installed adjacent to a cul-de-sac, local
or collector street. On residential properties located adjacent to a cul-de-
sac, local or collector street, the developer shall be required to install at
least one front yard tree, as long as the type of tree is listed in Section
1212.14(b).

piece of property to be subdivided: Where there has been a 5-foot easement
already recorded, another 5-foot easement shall be recorded.
   (c)   Street Lights.  Street lights shall be provided on poles served by
underground utilities. The height of a subdivision's street lights may vary,
depending on factors such as lot size, density, right- of-way width and setback
requirements. In no instance, however, shall they exceed 24 feet in height. In
residential subdivisions, street lights shall be pedestrian scale, ranging from
14 feet to 18 feet. Spacing between lights. shall be determined by industry
standards of street illumination and shall be sufficient to promote nighttime
safety for pedestrians. Spacing between street lights shall not be greater than
200 feet and correspondingly less for pedestrian scale lighting.. Lighting
shall also be consistent with any City which may be administratively adopted
under the authority provided by these regulations.

such as in apartment and condominium communities, all street signs shall be of
the same material, design, and color as other street signs in the City.
   (e)   Gateways.  The subdivider shall provide an attractive landscaped
entrance, as well as a structure(s) consisting of stone, brick, or combination
thereof, for all subdivisions which comprise 10 or more acres, or 30 or more
dwelling units. All gateway structures and landscaped entrances must be
approved by the Planning Commission. The requirement of a gateway may be waived
by the Planning Commission where insufficient land is available, or for other
good cause.
   (f)   Lot Landscaping.  Each lot shall be finished with at least one of the
following:  undisturbed existing ground cover, seeding or sod.
   (g)   Bicycle Lanes Along Streets.  Where required by the Planning
Commission, these shall be established with a minimum width of 8 feet.

required or approved one or more public access easements within the
subdivision, these areas of the final plat shall be circumscribed and labeled
as public access easements on the final plat, and the following notation shall

following covenants:
      (1)   "Public Access Easements are dedicated to the public access and
use. This grant shall run with the land in perpetuity."

drives constructed within designated Public Access Easements shall be open and
accessible to fire, police, and other emergency and maintenance vehicles at all
times. The pavement, curb, and gutter of private drives within Public Access
Easements shall be continuously maintained by the property owner in good repair
and kept free of all obstructions which would impede the free and safe movement
of traffic, including but not limited to ice, snow and parked vehicles. If
required by the City, the owner shall prepare a traffic control plan for review
and approval. Traffic control devices shall be provided and installed in accord
with the approved plan and by the owner. The City of Trenton shall have full

necessary, to charge the owner for the entire cost thereof, and in the event of
failure of payment for more than thirty days, to collect such costs as a
special assessment against the property without further notice to or approval
by the owner."

1240.01  TITLE.
   These regulations shall be known and may be cited as the Trenton, Ohio
Zoning Code or Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1240.02  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The text and map of this Zoning Code are established pursuant to applicable
provisions of the Ohio Revised Code and under the Home Rule authority granted
by Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution. By the adoption of this
Zoning Code, the City intends to promote the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of its residents, businesses and visitors through the following
objectives:
   (a)   To prevent community needs and priorities from becoming subservient to
regional market pressures.
   (b)   To prevent hazards to the health and safety of the public and of all
occupants of improved real property.
   (c)   To assure adequate light, air and convenience of access for all
properties.
   (d)   To promote the delivery of public services such as utilities, streets,
refuse collection, emergency medical services, fire and police protection.
   (e)   To separate incompatible land uses and cluster compatible and mutually
supportive land uses.
   (f)   To create physical buffers between zones where generally beneficial,
and within zones where tensions or conflicts may occur between dissimilar land
uses.
   (g)   To provide for creatively designed single-use and mixed-use Planned
Unit Developments, and to preserve their character and vitality through ongoing
regulatory supervision.
   (h)   To assure, through an appropriate site plan review, that the general,
district and supplementary regulations of this Zoning Code are being followed
in the design of each new site improvement or redevelopment.
   (i)   To minimize adverse effects on traffic safety caused by development
and certain land uses.
   (j)   To minimize adverse effects on the environment resulting from
development and certain land uses.
   (k)   To facilitate the efficient and economical development and use of land
and public facilities.
   (l)   To allocate to each site development, rather than to the public, the
maximum feasible portion of the infrastructure and operating costs which arise
as a result of that development.
   (m)   To fairly balance the interest of property owners and occupants in
continuing their nonconforming land uses against the community interest in
achieving full compliance with this Zoning Code.
   (n)   To protect floodways and flood plains from development which increases
the general risk of flooding or puts occupants of the development at risk.
   (o)   To preserve and enhance property values.
   (p)   To protect public and private water supplies, both in quality and
quantity.
   (q)   To promote the economic vitality of business and industry.
   (r)   To direct particular land uses to the parcels of land best suited for
them physically and in terms of access to highways and public services.
   (s)   To enhance the predictability and profitability of private investments
made in the City.
   (t)   To continuously improve the aesthetic character of all parts of the
City.
   (u)   To provide for variances from certain aspects of this Zoning Code
where justified by special circumstances and where the public interest will not
be adversely affected.
   (v)   To provide for thorough, efficient and lawful Code administration.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1240.03  RELATIONSHIP TO MASTER PLAN.
   This Zoning Code is the primary means by which the City can implement its
Land Use Master Plan and accomplish the long-range goals that its citizens have
for the development and redevelopment of their community. Although the Land Use
Master Plan does not control all zoning decisions, it should be followed to the
maximum extent practicable, taking into account the current facts and
circumstances.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1240.04  SCOPE OF REGULATIONS.
   This Zoning Code shall apply to all land that has been zoned by action of
the City Council. All property owners, lessees and other persons having a legal
or equitable interest in land subject to this Code shall comply under penalty
of law.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1240.05  ZONING UPON ANNEXATION.
   Upon the annexation of any lands into the City, with or without an
application by the affected property owner(s), the Planning Commission shall
forthwith undertake a study to determine the most appropriate zoning for the
newly annexed lands, in view of the Master Land Use Plan of the City
(hereinafter "Master Plan"). In the event that the Master Plan does not
encompass the annexed area, the Commission may consider an appropriate
enlargement of the planning area before or after the development of zoning
recommendations for the enlargement area. The Commission shall forward its
recommendations for zoning of the newly annexed area, and any recommendations
related to enlargement of the Master Plan, to the City Council. After notice
and hearing as required by Ohio R.C. 713.12, the Council shall then adopt City
zoning for the newly annexed lands.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1240.06  PROVISIONS OF ZONING CODE ARE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Zoning Code
shall be minimum requirements. Where this Zoning Code imposes a greater
restriction or level of performance than is imposed or required by other
provisions of law or by other rules or regulations or ordinances, the
provisions of this Zoning Code shall control.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1240.07  VALIDITY AND SEVERABILITY.
   It is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that, if any provision or
provisions of this Zoning Code, or the application thereof to any zoning lot,
building, structure, or tract of land, are declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or ineffective, in whole or in part, or to be
inapplicable to any person or situation, the effect of such decision shall be
limited to the provision or provisions which are expressly stated in the
decision to be invalid or ineffective, and shall apply only to the zoning lot,
building, structure, or tract of land immediately involved in the controversy.
All other provisions of this Zoning Code shall continue to be fully effective.

thereof.
   (a)   The certificate of occupancy shall state that the completed ,

necessary to render the agreement legally and practicably enforceable.

1280. No statement or writing issued by an official, officer, employee,
department, board, commission or bureau of the City pertaining to the temporary
or permanent use of land or buildings shall be valid unless fully in
conformance with, and made under the express authorization of this Zoning Code.

prohibit sloping away, positive drainage shall be allowed, provided appropriate
drainage away from the structure is included;
         H.   Lot number, subdivision name, section, town, range, city, county
and state;
         I.   All existing structures located on the property and including

any zoning certificate has not been substantially completed within 1 year of
the date of issuance thereof, said zoning certificate shall expire and be
revoked by the Zoning Administrator. Written notice of such expiration and
revocation shall be given to the persons affected, together with notice that
further work as described in the canceled zoning certificate shall not proceed
unless and until a new zoning certificate has been obtained or extension
granted.
   (c)   A person holding an unexpired zoning certificate may apply for a 1-
time extension for a period not to exceed 1 year, provided he or she can show
good and satisfactory reasons that are beyond his or her control why the work
cannot be completed within the 1-year period from the issue date. The fee for
such extension shall be one-half the amount required for a new zoning
certificate for such work, provided no changes have been made in the original
plans and specifications for such work.

by the Zoning Administrator and others. Therefore, these fees are not
refundable regardless of the outcome of the application.

(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03; Ord. 05-2016.  Passed 4-7-16.)
1246.02  JURISDICTION OF BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the following jurisdiction:

1242.01.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals is without authority to consider

   (c)   Other matters as assigned by ordinance.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03; Ord. 05-2016.  Passed 4-7-16.)

of the City acting within the scope of employment.
   (b)   Application Forms.  The application for an administrative appeal shall
be completed on a form provided by the City.

longer than 20 days after the actual mailing date of the written denial. The

may make recommendations to the Board as to any case before it.

Zoning Appeals shall be final, subject only to appeal to a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Board shall render a written decision on the application to
the applicant and City Council not later than 60 days following the close of
its hearing, unless a longer period is agreed to by the applicant. Nothing in
this Zoning Code shall prevent the Board from continuing a hearing into
successive meetings until all information needed to make an informed decision

opportunity to review and analyze the information. A Zoning Certificate may be
issued by the Zoning Administrator at any time after 30 days following the date
the decision becomes effective.
   (g)   Period of Validity.  An administrative appeal granted by the Board of

the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals to a court of competent

time and place for the hearing of the variance request and give at least 10
days written notice of the hearing to the owners and/or tenants of property

addition, public notice of the hearing as to the time, place, date and subject
of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City at least 10 days prior to the date of the hearing. Any party in interest
may appear and be heard at the hearing in person, by agent or by legal counsel.
At its option, the Board may hold any or all of its hearings with sufficient
formalities to eliminate the need for a de novo review by the courts in the
event of an appeal under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
   (e)   Criteria for Approval.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have
authority to grant dimensional variances for the location (setback), height,
bulk, or lot coverage of proposed buildings or other proposed improvements to
properties regulated by this Zoning Code. In no case shall the Board have
authority to grant variances as to use. No variance from the terms of this
Zoning Code may be granted until the Board evaluates the proposed variance in
view of the following criteria, and makes written findings of fact as to these
criteria and any other matters that the Board may find relevant. An affirmative
finding as to each of the following criteria is necessary to the approval of a
variance:
      (1)   The requested variance is justified by a practical difficulty.
      (2)   The practical difficulty was not created by the unlawful acts or
omissions of any owner or tenant.
      (3)   The practical difficulty does not commonly occur in any
neighborhood in the City having the same zoning classification as the subject
property.
      (4)   Approval of the variance would not materially damage the character
of the neighborhood.
      (5)   Approval of the variance would not violate a significant
legislative purpose of the Zoning Code.
      (6)   Approval of the variance would not reduce the efficiency of
emergency services or adversely and unreasonably affect non-emergency public
services.
      (7)   There is no reasonable solution to the practical difficulty other
than a variance and the variance requested is the least that can reasonably
reduce the practical difficulty.
   (f)   Recommendations of the Zoning Administrator.  The Zoning Administrator
may make recommendations to the Board as to any case before it.
   (g)   Conditions and Restrictions.  In granting a variance, the Board of
Zoning Appeals may impose such conditions, safeguards, and restrictions on the
premises benefited by the variance as may be necessary to respond to the
concerns set out in division (e) of this section or to reduce or minimize
potentially injurious effects of the variance on other properties in the
neighborhood, or to carry out the general purpose and intent of this Zoning
Code.
   (h)   Decision on a Variance.  The decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall be final, subject only to appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction.
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall render a written decision on the application
to City Council and the applicant not later than 60 days after the close of the
hearing, unless a longer period is agreed to by the applicant. Nothing in this
Zoning Code shall prevent the Board from continuing a hearing into successive
meetings until all information needed to make an informed decision has been
obtained to its satisfaction and the Board has had sufficient opportunity to
review and analyze the information. A Zoning Certificate may be issued by the
Zoning Administrator at any time after 30 days following the date the decision
becomes effective.
   (i)   Period of Validity.  A variance granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall lapse at the end of 6 months from the date on which the Board grants the
variance, unless within the 6-month period a zoning certificate is obtained for
the proposed change or improvement.
   (j)   Appeal by City Council.  City Council shall have standing to appeal
the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals to a court of competent
jurisdiction within 30 days following the date that the decision by the Board
becomes effective.

1248.03  ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   (a)   Creation and Adoption.  A certain map, prepared by the Planning and 
Zoning Division, dated November 5, 2002, and which shall be amended on or about
June 19, 2003 (hereinafter "original Zoning Map") is hereby adopted by the City
Council as the only true and accurate depiction of the configuration of zoning
districts made effective with the adoption of this Zoning Code. The original
Zoning Map and all notations and references and other matters shown thereon are
made part of this Zoning Code. This map, or a duly authenticated replacement of
it, with all subsequent amendments, shall be continuously maintained in the
City offices for reproduction purposes and the reference of interested persons.
Such map shall be captioned "Official Zoning Map of the City of Trenton, Ohio."
It is the intent of this Zoning Code that the entire area under the
jurisdiction of City zoning, including all land, water areas, rivers, streets,
alleys, and railroad and other rights-of-way be included in the districts
established by this Zoning Code. Any area recently annexed, or for any other
reason not shown on the Official Zoning District Map as being included in any
district, shall be, and hereby is deemed to be in the R-E Estate Single-Family
Residential District.
   (b)   Authentication.  The original Zoning Map and any reproducible
replacement thereof, including all subsequent amendments, shall be
authenticated by the signature of the Mayor, attested to by the Clerk of
Council, under the following words: "This is to certify that this is the
official zoning map referred to in Chapter 1248 of the Codified Ordinances of
Trenton, Ohio, as adopted on or about May 1, 2003, with any subsequent
amendments indicated hereon."
   (c)   Amendment.  The official Zoning Map (hereinafter "the Zoning Map") may
be amended only when authorized by official action of the City Council as
provided by statute and in this Zoning Code. No new authentication of the
original reproducible Zoning Map shall be necessary following such changes, the
authorizing ordinances and map annotations being sufficient documentation.
   (d)   Replacement of Reproducible Map.  The Zoning Map, as amended from time
to time, shall be maintained in a format suitable for reproduction and kept in
a place of safekeeping by the Zoning Administrator. If the original
reproducible Zoning Map must be replaced by a new base map due to loss,
destruction, excessive changes or any other reason, the superseded reproducible
map shall be retained in the permanent records of the City.  The reproducible
map may be corrected for drafting or other errors and omissions only by
replacing it with a new reproducible base map. Any new reproducible base map
must be newly authenticated before it is published. With the approval of the
Zoning Administrator, the succession of reproducible base maps may be prepared
and/or preserved on electronic media, provided that the system used provides
for authentication of each new base map and effectively prevents the loss of
historical information.
   (e)   Re-drafting: Annotation.  Upon Council approval of any amendment to
the Zoning Map, the Zoning Administrator shall alter the reproducible Zoning
Map to show the amendment. Each parcel or contiguous group of parcels affected
by the rezoning shall be annotated to indicate the new zoning, the ordinance
number adopting the amendment, and the date of adoption. Such annotations shall
remain on the map through any subsequent rezonings and map re-draftings, so
that the history of zoning for each parcel is plainly evident.
   (f)   Publication.  Copies of the current Zoning Map may be distributed or
otherwise published with or without attachment to the Zoning Code.
   (g)   Rules of Interpretation.  Where the Zoning Administrator determines
that there is uncertainty with respect to the intended boundaries of any of the
zoning districts shown on the official Zoning Map, and their location cannot be
determined by reference to the original enacting legislation, the following
rules shall apply:
      (1)   Where a district boundary is shown as approximately following the
centerline of a street or highway, or the right-of-way line abutting a street
or highway, or a lot line, such centerline, right-of-way line or lot line shall
be deemed to be such boundary;
      (2)   Where district boundaries are shown as approximately parallel to a
street or highway, or to the right-of-way line abutting a street or highway, or
a lot line, such boundary shall be deemed to be parallel to such centerline,
right-of-way line or lot line, at the average distance which can be scaled from
the Zoning Map;
      (3)   Where the district boundaries appear to follow a railroad line,
such boundary shall be deemed to follow the centerline of the most-used track
of such railroad line;
      (4)   Where district boundaries follow a stream, lake or other body of
water, such boundary shall be deemed to follow the edge of such water;
      (5)   Where the Zoning Administrator cannot determine the precise
location of the boundary of a district by reviewing the applicable ordinances
and/or applying these rules, the City Council shall make the determination
after requesting a recommendation from the Planning Commission and giving
notice and opportunity for a hearing to the affected property owners, all as in
a rezoning.

capacity of existing tanks. Replacement of underground tanks for regulated
substances other than the above noted fuels and lubricants is not permitted.
      (8)   As part of the information to be evaluated under Section
1244.07 prior to issuance of a zoning certificate, the Zoning Administrator
shall utilize the Contaminant Hazard Potential Ranking System in division (e)
of this section to assist in the determination of intensity of use within this
district. No substitutions of a nonconforming use shall be permitted which
result in an increase of the Contaminant Hazard Potential Ranking on a parcel
within this district.
   (e)   Groundwater Hazard Potential Ranking System.
      (1)   Any existing uses legally storing, handling, using and/or producing
regulated substances in amounts equal to or less than the requirements under
division (d)(1) of this section are considered conforming uses and this section
does not apply. Any new use or change of use shall maintain the conforming
status of the property.
      (2)   Existing nonconforming uses shall be permitted to maintain the
reported maximum quantity for each reportable regulated substance as reported
according to Section
1280.02 as determined by peak business cycle. Existing uses and maximum
quantities, in combination with a hazard potential rating shall run with the
land and be administered in conformance with all other applicable nonconforming
provisions of this Zoning Code.
      (3)   In order to assess the risk for potential groundwater
contamination, a hazard ranking has been developed for various activities
categorized by their Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. This
ranking is based on the kind of materials commonly associated with each use,
looking only at the most critical hydrologic factors.
      (4)   Table 1 below lists the site hazard potential by land use activity
on a scale of I to 9, with 1 being a low hazard and 9 a very high hazard. This
rating is based on the intrinsic hazards posed by different land uses and is
related to the materials commonly used or stored on the site or the types and
amounts of wastes commonly discharged.
      (5)   Table 2 below lists the hazard potential determined on the basis of
materials known to be used, stored, or disposed of at a specific site.
      (6)   If the two tables referenced above indicate different site hazard
potential ratings for the SIC-coded land use activity and the materials found
on-site, the higher of the 2 scores is the rating for the site.

(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
CHAPTER 1254
Existing and Nonconforming Uses
1254.01   Intent.
1254.02   Conformance required.
1254.03   Active building permits.
1254.04   Nonconforming vacant lots of record.
1254.05   Nonconforming lots of record in combination.
1254.06   Nonconforming structures.
1254.07   Nonconforming uses.
1254.08   Unsafe buildings.
1254.01  INTENT.
   Within the conventional zoning districts established by this Zoning Code,
there exist lots, structures, uses of land and/or structures and
characteristics of land use that were lawful before this Zoning Code was
adopted, but which are no longer permitted. With regard to most
nonconformities, it is the intent of this chapter to permit them to continue
until they are discontinued for a long enough period to be deemed abandoned, or
so severely damaged that they are substantially destroyed. It is further the
intent of this section that nonconformities not be enlarged, expanded, extended
or intensified. However, it is recognized that all nonconformities do not
represent the same negative impact on the purposes of zoning, and some relief
from these restrictions may be in the public interest as well as the interest
of the owner of the nonconformity.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1254.02  CONFORMANCE REQUIRED.
   Except as specified in this chapter, no land, building, structure or
premises shall hereafter be used, and no building or part thereof, or other
structure, shall be located, erected, moved, reconstructed, extended, enlarged,
or altered, except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the
zoning district in which it is located, the supplementary regulations
applicable to all zoning districts, and the supplementary regulations
applicable to specific uses.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1254.03  ACTIVE BUILDING PERMITS.
   Nothing contained in this Zoning Code shall require any change in the
overall layout, plans, construction, size, or designated use of any
development, building, structure, or part thereof, for which official approvals
and required building permits have been granted before the enactment of this
Zoning Code, the construction of which, conforming with such plans, shall begin
within the period of the permit's validity and continue to completion without
interruption, except for causes beyond the builder's control.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1254.04  NONCONFORMING VACANT LOTS OF RECORD.
   (a)   In Residential Districts.  In any residential district, a one-family
detached dwelling may be erected on any single lot of official record as of the
effective date of this Zoning Code, even though by reason of its lot area,
width, or depth, the lot does not meet minimum requirements of the zoning
district wherein it is located, provided that the following requirements are
met:
      (1)   The lot shall not be less than 50 feet wide.
      (2)   The sum of the side yard widths on any such lot of record shall be
at least 25% of the width of the lot.
      (3)   The width of each side yard shall not be less than 10% of the width
of the lot.
      (4)   The depth of the rear yard of any such lot need not exceed 20% of
the depth of the lot, but in no case shall it be less than 30 feet.
      (5)   The residence to be constructed meets the minimum floor area
requirements of the zoning district wherein located.
   (b)   In Other Districts.  In any nonresidential district, a building
designed for any permitted use in the district may be erected on any lot of
official record as of the effective date of this Zoning Code, provided that the
building complies with all district regulations. However, the width of any
required side yard may be adjusted by applying the following equation, where
"X" is the adjusted side yard width:
   X = Actual lot width x normally required side yard  ÷ normally required lot
width.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1254.05  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD IN COMBINATION.
   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of adoption
of this Zoning Code, and if part or all of the lots do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be
replatted to create as many lots as possible which conform to such
requirements, or which conform to the maximum extent possible, before
considering the combined lots as one or more lots of record. No portion of such
lot or parcel shall be used or sold, the conveyance of which diminishes the
potential for a combination of lots that decreases the nonconformity of a
parcel or parcels. No division of any parcel may be made which increases the
nonconformity of the parcel or which creates any new lot that does not fully
conform to the width and area requirements of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1254.06  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Continuation.  Any structure which is of such a size, height or
location that it does not meet the applicable zoning requirements, may be
continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions
of divisions (b) through (d) of this section.
   (b)   Enlargement, Repair, Alterations.  Any structure described in division
(a) of this section may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or altered. However,
no such enlargement, maintenance, repair, or alteration shall neither create
any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity
of all or any part of such structures; except that for structures located on a
lot that does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements, the side
yard requirements shall be determined by Section
1254.04(a) or (b), whichever is applicable.
   (c)   Damage or Destruction.  In the event that any structure described in
division (a) of this section is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the
extent of more than 75% of the current replacement cost of the entire
structure, exclusive of foundation, the structure shall not be restored unless
it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which
it is located except that as to structures located on a lot that does not
comply with the applicable lot size requirements, the side yard requirements
shall be determined by Section
1254.04(a) or (b), whichever is applicable.
   (d)   Moving.  No structure described in division (a) of this section shall
be moved in whole or in part, for any distance whatever, to any other location
on the same or any other lot unless the entire structure shall thereafter
conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it will be located
after being moved.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1254.07  NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   Continuation.  Any lawfully existing nonconforming use of all or part
of a structure or any lawfully existing nonconforming use of land not involving
a structure may be continued, so long as otherwise lawful, subject to the
restrictions of this section.
   (b)   Extension of Use.  Any lawfully existing nonconforming use of part of
a structure may be enlarged or extended within the structure, but may not be
extended or enlarged by the use of additional land outside the structure,
except as permitted under Section
1254.06(b).
   (c)   Expansion of Parking.  Nothing in this section shall in any way
prohibit a nonconforming use from acquiring or developing additional off-street
parking space, provided the expansion meets with the off-street parking
regulations prescribed in Chapter
1262.

the lot immediately adjoining along the same frontage. However, no building on
any lot, including all projections, may be closer than 20 feet from any public
street.
   (b)   In any zoning district where the natural grade of a lot within the
required front yard has an average slope, such slope being normal to the front
lot line at every point along the line, of such a severity that it is not

garage conforming to the requirements of this Zoning Code, the garage may be
located within the front yard, but not in any case closer than 20 feet to the
street lines.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1256.10  ARCHITECTURAL PROJECTIONS INTO REQUIRED YARDS.
   Architectural features may project into required yards or into courts as
follows:
   (a)   Front or Side Yards Adjoining Side Streets.  Into any required front
or side yard adjoining a side street:
      (1)   Cornices, canopies, eaves, or other architectural features may
project a distance not to exceed 2 feet, 6 inches.
      (2)   Fire escapes may project a distance not to exceed 4 feet, 6 inches.
      (3)   An open stair and necessary landing may project a distance not to

      (4)   A front porch may project into a front yard a distance not to
exceed 6 feet, provided it is open on 3 sides, except for railing or banisters.
      (5)   Bay windows, balconies, or chimneys may project into a yard a
distance not to exceed 5 feet. However, the aggregate width of the projection
shall not exceed one- third of the length of the wall on which they are
located.
      (6)   A.   On any lot containing a minimum of 10,000 square feet, a
roofline or footer may project into the rear yard a distance not to exceed 10
feet, provided that the remainder of the rear yard extends a minimum of 20
feet.  Said roofline or footer may not extend more than 1/3 the width of the
primary structure.  For the purpose of this section, footers shall include but
not be limited to support columns, piers, monolithic slabs, and post and beam
construction.
         B.   Example:  A residential property owner applies for a sunroom
addition onto the rear of his or her home.  The lot is 12,000 square feet in
area and contains a 30- foot rear yard.  The primary residential structure is
45 feet wide.  The sunroom may extend a maximum of 10 feet into the rear yard,
leaving 20 feet of green space to the rear property line.  The sunroom can be
no wider than 1/3 of the width of the primary structure, or 15 feet wide (1/
3 of 45 feet).  Therefore, the sunroom may be no larger than 10 feet deep by 15
feet wide.
   (b)   Side Yards.  Subject to the limitations in the preceding divisions,
the above-named features may project into any required side yard adjoining an
interior side lot line, a distance not to exceed one-fifth of the required
least width of the side yard, but not exceeding 3 feet in any case.
   (c)   Rear Yards.  Subject to the limitations in division (a) of this
section, the features named therein may project into any required rear yards or
into any required outer court the same distance they are permitted to project
into a front yard.
   (d)   Improvements Required by the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
Decisions of the Board of Zoning Appeals regarding architectural projections
required for persons with disabilities that necessitate encroachment into any
required front, side, or rear yard shall be based upon the Americans With
Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities,
36 CFR Part 1191, as amended.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03; Ord. 03-2005.  Passed 2-3-05.)
1256.11  FENCES, WALLS AND HEDGES.
   (a)   A hedge or shrubbery may be placed or grown in any residential zoned
property and shall be regulated by the regulations for a fence contained within
this section. A hedge or shrubbery may also be placed or grown and maintained
in a required front yard not to exceed 3 feet in height, impair pedestrian
traffic or create a hazard for vehicular travel.
   (b)   Decorative walls no greater than 3 feet in height may be placed in any
yard when used as part of the landscaping but not contained within a right-of-
way, drainage easement, open channel drainage easement or access easement.
Walls more than 4 feet tall measured from the bottom of the footing to the top
of the wall shall be regulated by the regulations for a fence contained within
this section and shall also require a building authorization. In addition to
these regulations, walls cannot be within 5 feet of any right-of-way, drainage
easement, open channel drainage easement or access easement.
   Topography of the land or unusual circumstances may require a retaining wall
that would exceed the regulations contained within this section. Before issuing
a zoning certificate or a building authorization, all such retaining walls
require approval by the City staff, chief building official and the City
Engineer for the minimum amount of retaining wall needed to correct the
topography of the land or the unusual circumstances.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-2003; Ord. 13-2006.  Passed 6-1-2006.)
   (c)   The following applies to all fencing:

      (5)   Fences shall be maintained and repaired and shall use materials
consistent with those existing.
      (6)   No fence shall be permitted within a drainage easement, open
channel drainage easement or access easement.
      (7)   Fencing placed adjacent to a drainage easement, open channel
drainage easement or access easement shall have a minimum of 1 access gate.
      (8)   Fencing within legal easements:
         A.   Property owners who install fencing within a legal easement must
recognize that the rights of the easement holder may prevail over their fee
simple interest in the property.
         B.   Fences may be erected or placed within legal easements only as
permitted by the easement holder.  It is the sole responsibility of the
property owner to be aware of, and to comply with, the rights, regulations and
requirements of the easement holder.
         C.   Routine City maintenance work within easements.  Where the City
needs to perform construction, repair or maintenance within an easement in
which a fence is located, the City shall give the property owner 30 days
written notice by personal service, by first class mail, or by posting the
notice on the front door of the principal structure on the affected property.
Such notice shall state what portion or portions of fencing and personal
property shall be removed by the owner.  The owner shall, at his expense and
within the allotted time, remove all fencing and personal property identified
in the notice.  In the event that the fence and personal property has not been
removed within the allowed time, the City or its agents may, at the City's
option and at any reasonable time, enter onto the property and remove the fence
and personal property. The actual cost of the removal of the fence and personal
property shall be invoiced to the property owner by first class mail or by
personal delivery. If the property owner has not paid this invoice in full
within 30 calendar days after its mailing, the City shall thereafter have the
right to assess its actual cost, plus a 15% administrative charge, against the
property to be paid with the real estate taxes. The City shall not be liable
for any damage to property resulting from its activities reasonably related to
the emergency.
         D.   Emergency City maintenance work within easements.  Where the City
needs to perform emergency construction, repair or maintenance within an
easement in which a fence is located, the City shall serve written notice to
the property owner by personal service or by posting the notice on the front
door of the principal structure on the affected property, if time permits under
the circumstances.  The City may thereafter remove the interfering portions of
the fence and personal property in order to address the emergency.  In such an
instance, the property owner shall not be responsible for any removal costs
incurred by the City, but shall be responsible for any repair or replacement
costs resulting from the removal. The City shall not be liable for any damage
to property resulting from its activities reasonably related to the emergency.
      (9)   Chain link fences shall not contain webbing or any other material
designed, intended or used to inhibit light, ventilation or sight.
      (10)   The height of all fencing shall be determined from the prevailing
level of surrounding land.
      (11)   No fence shall be constructed or maintained so as to obstruct
surface drainage.
      (12)   In the event that any fence is in violation of the maintenance,
design or location requirements or limitations of the codified ordinances, or
is in violation of any other legal standard or requirement adopted by the City,
the owner of the offending fence shall be given 30 calendar days written notice
by first class mail or by personal delivery to remedy the violation.  In the
event that the violation is not corrected within the allowed time, the City or
its agents may, at the City's option and at any reasonable time, enter onto the
property and correct the violation. The actual cost of such repairs shall be
invoiced to the property owner by first class mail or by personal delivery.  If
the property owner has not paid this invoice in full within 30 calendar days
after its mailing, the City shall thereafter have the right to assess its
actual cost, plus a 15% administrative charge, against the property to be paid
with the real estate taxes.
   (d)   Residential Interior Lot Fencing.
      (1)   Fences shall be a maximum height of 6'2" tall measuring from the
ground up exclusive of mounding.
      (2)   Fences shall only be located in the rear yard except as otherwise
permitted in this section.

be permitted.
      (5)   Chain link fences shall not exceed 4 feet in height measured from
the ground exclusive of mounding.
      (6)   Through lots: Fencing in the conventional rear yard shall not be
less than 40 feet from the right-of-way of the street which the primary
residence does not face.
   (e)   Residential Corner Lot Fencing.
      (1)   Fences shall be a maximum height of 6'2" tall measuring from the
ground up exclusive of mounding.
      (2)   Fences shall only be located in the side and rear yard except as
otherwise permitted in this section.

         B.   No fencing shall encroach the required set back lines of adjacent
properties.
   (f)   Fencing in Commercial and Industrial Zoning Districts.
      (1)   It is recognized that the fencing needs of commercial and
industrial uses are so varied that any attempt to regulate them by fixed
standards would work a hardship on property owners and tenants by unnecessarily
obstructing or delaying the establishment and evolution of such uses.  These
regulations are designed to allow a more creative and efficient use of these
fences while effectively regulating them in the public interest.
      (2)   Fencing that is permitted in residential zoning districts for
residential uses shall be permitted for any residential, commercial or
industrial use in any zoning district.
      (3)   When a land owner believes that the fencing that is permissible in
residential districts is not sufficient for the needs of his particular
commercial or industrial use, he may apply for a conditional commercial/
industrial fence permit under either of the following procedures:
         A.   Standard procedure.
            1.   Complete the prescribed application for a commercial/
industrial fence permit including submission of the required attachments, which
shall at a minimum, include a scale drawing of the property showing the
location of all proposed fencing and the style and dimensions of the fencing
designs proposed for each differing section.
            2.   Submit the completed application to the City Planning
Commission for comprehensive review which takes into account the uses on the
property, similar to the fencing review that may be performed as part of the
approval process for a planned unit development.
            3.   Attend a hearing before, and scheduled by, the Planning
Commission to discuss all aspects of the application.
            4.   If the application as submitted, or as subsequently modified
by the applicant before, during or after the hearing, demonstrates that the
proposed fencing is in all respects essential to the use including location,
height, coverage, materials and construction; is not visually or functionally
incompatible with previously permitted fences on adjacent properties; and is
otherwise in the overall best interest of the City, the Planning Commission may
recommend to the City Council that the necessary zoning certificate and permit
be issued.
            5.   The City Council may accept the recommendation; reject the
recommendation; or by a 2/3 vote, refer the application back to the Planning
Commission with its comments for further review and recommendation.
            6.   If the Council accepts the recommendation, the Zoning
Administrator shall issue the necessary permits upon payment of the prescribed
fees.
         B.   Expedited procedure.  The City understands that time is often of
the essence in commercial and industrial construction. The applicant may elect
to pursue the following expedited procedure:
            1.   Complete the prescribed application for a commercial/
industrial fence permit including submission of the required attachments, which
shall at a minimum, include a scale drawing of the property showing the
location of all proposed fencing and the style and dimensions of the fencing
designs proposed for each differing section.
            2.   Submit the completed application to the City Planning
Commission for comprehensive review which takes into account the uses on the
property, similar to the fencing review that may be performed as part of the
approval process for a planned unit development.
            3.   If requested by the Zoning Administrator, attend an
administrative hearing to discuss all aspects of the application.
            4.   If the Zoning Administrator determines that the application as
submitted, or as subsequently modified by the applicant before, during or after
the hearing, demonstrates that the proposed fencing is in all respects
essential to the use including location, height, coverage, materials and
construction; is not visually or functionally incompatible with previously-
permitted fences on adjacent properties; and is otherwise in the overall best
interest of the City, he may approve the necessary zoning certificate and
permit.
            5.   The expedited procedure shall not be available as an appeal of
the standard procedure.  However, the standard procedure shall be available as
an appeal of the expedited procedure.  Only one application fee shall be
charged regardless of the application procedure(s) used.  Any application made
after a final decision by the City Council shall require a new application fee.
   (g)   Approval of a Commercial/Industrial Fence Permit is Conditional. All
commercial/ industrial fence permits are specific to the property and land use
(s) specified in the application.  The City Council, upon a significant
subsequent change in the land use and pursuant to a recommendation by the City
Manager, may determine that a particular fence is no longer warranted by the
use.  If after giving the current property owner opportunity for a hearing, the
Council finds that the recommendation of the City Manager is well-taken, the
Zoning Administrator shall order the fence to be removed or modified to be
appropriate for the current use, as determined by the Council.  A fence which
is not removed or modified in accord with such an order may be declared a
public nuisance.  Thereafter, it may be abated by the City in accord with Ohio
R.C. 715.44, with the expense thereof collected from the property owner
following the procedure set forth in Ohio R.C. 715.261.
(Ord. 03-2015.  Passed 5-7-15.)
1256.12  SCREENING OF TRASH STORAGE AREAS.
   Any new or altered commercial use which requires site plan review and has an
outdoor trash storage area shall comply with the following requirements:
   (a)   Any such area shall be limited to normal refuse that is collected on a
regular basis and shall be maintained in a neat, orderly, sanitary condition.
   (b)   In no instance shall any such refuse be visible above the required
enclosure.
   (c)   Any such storage area shall be located in a rear yard and be so
located and arranged as to minimize its visibility from adjacent streets and
uses. An obscuring gate shall be required when the interior of such a storage
area would otherwise be visible from a public street or adjacent use. In no
instance shall any trash storage area be located in a front yard.
   (d)   Construction of trash storage areas, also known as dumpster corrals,
shall conform to the standard construction drawings for dumpster corrals per
Chapter 1214, Appendix C of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Trenton,
Ohio unless otherwise permitted by the recommendations of the Planning
Commission and subsequent approval of City Council.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03; Ord. 13-2014.  Passed 10-16-14.)
1256.13  USES NOT SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED.
   Any use of land, a structure, or a building that is not specifically named
as a permitted principal or accessory use within any zoning district shall not
be permitted until it is determined by the Zoning Administrator that such use
is similar and compatible to those uses expressly permitted within such
district. The decision of the Zoning Administrator may be appealed as provided
in Chapter
1246.

placed closer than 50 feet to any property line, or such greater distance as
specified by the Board of Zoning Appeals, where such is deemed necessary for
the protection of adjacent property, except that this distance requirement
maybe reduced by the written consent of the owner or owners of abutting
property, but in any event, adequate lateral support shall be provided for the
abutting property.
      (2)   In the event that the site of the mining operation is adjacent to
the right-of-way of any public street or road, no part of the operation shall
take place closer than 50 feet to the nearest line of the right-of-way, except
as may otherwise be provided by Ohio R.C. 4152.11.

fencing or barrier is necessary for the protection of the public safety, and
shall be of a type specified by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (5)   All equipment and machinery shall be operated and maintained in
such manner as to minimize dust, noise, and vibration. Access roads shall be
maintained in a dust- free condition by surfacing or other treatment as may be
specified by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (6)   Quarrying shall not be carried out closer than 300 feet to any
adjoining property line unless the written consent of the adjoining property
owner has first been obtained.
      (7)   The Board of Zoning Appeals is authorized to impose such
requirements with respect to providing adequate barriers as it may feel
necessary to protect the public safety.
   (c)   Rehabilitation Requirements.  All mined-out areas shall, within a
reasonable length of time, be reclaimed and rehabilitated, and the Zoning
Administrator may require a bond in a sufficient amount to assure that the
rehabilitation and reclamation will be carried out as a condition of permit
approval. The Zoning Administrator shall be guided by the following standards
with respect to rehabilitation and reclamation of mined-out areas:
      (1)   All excavation shall be made either to a water-producing depth,
such depth to be not less than 5 feet below the water mark, or shall be graded
or backfilled with non- noxious, non-combustible, and nonflammable solids, to
secure:
         A.   That the excavated area shall not collect, and permit to remain
therein, stagnant water; or
         B.   That the surface of the area which is not permanently submerged
is graded or backfilled as necessary so as to reduce the peaks and depressions
thereof so as to produce a gently rolling surface that will minimize erosion
due to rainfall and which will be in substantial conformity to the adjoining
land area.
      (2)   The banks of all sand and gravel excavations in a water-producing
excavation, and to the pit bottom in a dry operation, shall be sloped to the
water line, at a slope which will not be less than 3 feet horizontal to 1 foot
vertical, and the banks shall be restored with vegetation in a manner set forth
in division (c)(3) of this section.
      (3)   Vegetation shall be restored by the spreading of sufficient solid
and by appropriate seeding of grasses or planting of shrubs and trees in all
parts of the mining area where the same is not submerged under water.
      (4)   Proper drainage shall be provided for the mined-out area.
      (5)   All equipment and structures shall be removed from the mined-out
area within 6 months of the completion of the mining therefrom.
      (6)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may impose such other reasonable
conditions and restrictions as it may deem necessary for the protection of the
public and to encourage the mining and processing of the sand and gravel from
the authorized area.
      (7)   Due to the inherent difficulties in reclaiming and rehabilitating
areas from which stone has been quarried, the Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby
empowered, in the issuance of a conditional use permit for quarrying
operations, to impose such reasonable standards for reclamation as may be
necessary to protect the public interest, without unduly restricting the
operations of the mine owner.

proposed conditional use on the subject property. If licensing is not required,
an affidavit from the applicant so stating shall be presented.
      (3)   A copy of the sponsoring agency's operational and occupancy
standards and a detailed plan for services and programs.
      (4)   A site plan for the proposed home indicating home structure outline
and floor plan, off-street parking provisions, driveway access, landscaping and

out of the facility. Within neighborhoods in which on-street parking is
accepted practice, on-street space directly abutting the subject lot may be
substituted for a portion of the required off-street spaces if approved by the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (d)   No facility shall be permitted within 1,500 feet of another community-
oriented residential social service facility or halfway house. The Zoning
Administrator may reduce this standard if the applicant can show that, due to
unique conditions, a reduction of the separation requirement will not
contribute to the concentration of such facilities (e.g., the proposed site is
located in a distinctly different neighborhood which is separated from an
existing site by a freeway or the site is in an area that does not constitute a
typical residential neighborhood due to a diversity of land uses).
   (e)   The Zoning Administrator shall review the facility for compliance with
building and electrical codes by the appropriate code enforcement officials.
   (f)   Required findings by the Zoning Administrator.  In reviewing each
proposed facility, the Zoning Administrator shall make specific findings of

or halfway house licensed by an agency of the State of Ohio. If such licensing
is not required, an affidavit so stating shall be presented to document this
statement.
      (3)   Be approved by the local agency responsible for providing support
services and/or programs to the facility.
      (4)   Be designed, constructed, and maintained so that such use will not
change the general character of the area and operated in compliance with
relevant licensing or certification standards.
      (5)   Not be within 1,500 feet of another community-oriented residential
social service facility or halfway house.
      (6)   Be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, water and sewer, and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services.

inconveniences the public or other businesses located on the same lot or a
nearby lot.
      (2)   In lieu of accepting a letter, the Zoning Administrator may require
the above information be submitted on a special zoning permit application or
other form furnished by the City.

Passed 4-7-16.)
1262.03  GENERAL STANDARDS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING AREAS.
   (a)   Utilization.  Required off-street parking facilities as listed in
Section
1262.02 shall be solely for the parking of motor vehicles in operating
condition, or patrons, occupants, or employees of such uses.
   (b)   Size.  A required off-street parking space shall be at least 10 feet
in width and at least 20 feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles,
ramps, columns, office or work area.
   (c)   Access.  Each required off-street parking space shall open directly on
an aisle or driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and efficient
means of vehicular access to the parking space. The aisle or driveway shall not
be used for the parking of other vehicles, except that the driveway of a
single-family residence may be counted as a parking space.
   (d)   Required Yards.  Structures and buildings containing off-street
parking shall be subject to the yard requirements applicable in the district in
which located. Off-street parking areas open to the sky may be located on any
yard, except that:
      (1)   In any residential zoning district or in the P-S Zoning District,
off-street parking shall not be located in any required front yard.
      (2)   In any residential zoning district on a corner lot devoted to a
residential use, the off- street parking shall not be located closer to the
side lot line bounding a street than the minimum side yard width prescribed by
the development standards for the district.
      (3)   If a lot is devoted to a nonresidential use and if its front lot
line, side lot line, or rear lot line separates the lot from a lot in a
residential district, the off-street parking facilities located thereon shall
not be closer to such lot line than the minimum front yard depth, side yard
width, or rear yard depth prescribed by the development standard for the
district.
   (e)   Location.  All required parking spaces shall be located as follows:
      (1)   In any residential zoning district, on the same lot as the building
or use served.
      (2)   In a business district, on the same lot as the building or use
served, or a contiguous parcel, or within 400 feet of the principal structure.
      (3)   In any industrial district, on the same lot as the building or use
served, or a contiguous parcel, or within 1,000 feet of the nearest point of
the principal structures. However, no off-street parking facilities for a
business or industrial use shall be located in a residential district.
   (f)   Restricted Parking Lots.  Notwithstanding the provisions of division
(e) of this section, the Zoning Administrator may permit the use of land lying
in a zoning district in which parking lots otherwise are not a permissible use,
as restricted parking lots.
      (1)   The approval of a restricted parking lot must be based on a finding
that:
         A.   The parcel to be used is located not more than 50 feet from the
parcel on which is located the land use requiring the parking facilities.
         B.   The parking lot or parking lots shall be for use in connection
with a permissible use in an adjacent zoning district, whether the adjacent
district is within the territory subject to this Zoning Code or is within a
territory subject to the zoning restrictions of another zoning authority. The
parking lot shall be used solely for the parking of private passenger vehicles.
         C.   The parking lot shall not be used for repair work or vehicle
servicing or loading of any kind, and no advertising signs of any kind shall be
erected on the lot.
         D.   The parking lot shall be closed between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.,
except as may be otherwise permitted by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall impose further conditions, such as
screening and landscaping, as may be deemed necessary and appropriate, in order
to reduce the adverse effect of a parking lot on the preservation of the
residential character and development of the residential district in which the
parking lot is proposed to be located.
   (g)   Repair and Service.  No motor vehicle repair work or service of any
kind, except emergency repairs, shall be permitted in or in association with
any off-street parking area.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1262.04  REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS TO OFF-STREET PARKING AREAS.
   (a)   Surfacing.  All off-street parking areas shall be paved with a minimum
of 4 inches of #304 compacted base overlain by at least 4 inches of concrete or
with a comparable all-weather surface acceptable to the City Engineer. No
motorized vehicles may be parked in or on any unpaved area, except as necessary
or incidental to construction on the premises.
   (b)   Curbing.  All parking lots within commercial or office zoning
districts shall be separated from unpaved areas by ODOT Type 6 concrete
curbing. The City Planning Commission may waive the requirement of curbing, but
only where a suitable discharge point for the collected water is not reasonably
available.
   (c)   Peripheral Landscaping Required.  All open off-street parking areas
shall be separated from public sidewalks and street rights-of-way by a
landscaped strip at least 10 feet in width, and a 6-inch high barrier (curb)
shall be provided on the parking lot side of such landscape strip.
   (d)   Screening.  When any open off-street parking area containing more than
5 parking spaces is adjacent to a residential district, a visual mechanical
barrier a minimum of 8 feet in height within side or rear yards and not more
than 3 feet in height within a front yard shall be provided along the common
line, to protect the privacy of the adjoining residential uses.  This barrier
may consist of any of the following:
      (1)   A solidly constructed decorative privacy fence of vinyl or similar
durable materials.  Note that wood materials shall not be allowed.
      (2)   A decorative masonry wall.
      (3)   A landscaped mound that is a minimum 6 feet in height with
additional ground cover and/or landscaping that is a minimum of 2 feet in
height.  Note that a landscaped mound that is 8 feet or taller shall negate the
additional ground cover/landscaping requirement.
      (4)   A combination of (1), (2) and (3) above, or other suitable option,
as approved by the Planning Commission.
   (e)   Lighting.  Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas
shall be equipped with suitable shielding or be so designed as to prevent a
glare at eye level on surrounding public or private property.
   (f)   Interior Landscaping Required.  No off-street parking areas shall be
constructed or enlarged until interior landscaping has been approved by the
City Planning Commission and installed.
      (1)   Landscape materials.  The primary landscaping materials used in
such off-street parking areas shall be trees which shall be 8 feet to 10 feet
in minimum overall height upon planting, and which provide shade or are capable
of providing shade at maturity. Shrubbery, hedges and other planting materials
may be used to complement the tree landscaping. A guide of planting types
deemed acceptable for landscaping purposes is on file in the office of the
Zoning Administrator and should be consulted prior to design of any parking
facility.
      (2)   Size of planting areas.  The interior dimensions of any planting
area or planting median shall be sufficient to protect the landscaping
materials planted therein and to ensure proper growth. In those instances where
plant material exists on a proposed parking facility prior to its development,
such landscape material may be used to meet the requirement of this Zoning
Code.
      (3)   Interior requirements.  Within interior vehicular use areas 10,000
square feet or greater in size, and for each additional 10,000 square foot unit
or a proportional fraction thereof, a minimum total of 500 square feet of
landscape area shall be provided, irrespective of the peripheral requirements.
For individual parking lots with more than 5 parking spaces and less than
10,000 square feet in area, 5% of the vehicular use area, irrespective of the
perimeter requirements, shall be devoted to landscape. Planting which is
required for screening along peripheral areas of parking facilities shall not
be considered as part of the interior coverage requirement.
         A.   Required trees.  A minimum of 2 trees, each a minimum size of 1-
3/4 inches in trunk diameter, shall be provided for each 10,000 square foot
unit of interior vehicular use area. The minimum distance from a tree to a
vehicular use area shall be 4 feet measured from the face of the tree.
         B.   Location of interior landscape area.  The interior landscape area
and trees required for each 10,000 square foot vehicular use area unit or
fraction thereof, shall be located within that vehicular use area unit or
fraction thereof. In areas where the Zoning Administrator has determined that
the strict application of this section will interfere with the function of a
vehicular use area, the unused portion of the required interior landscaping
shall be relocated, upon recommendation by the Planning Commission, elsewhere
on the property so as to emphasize a landscaping feature. In order that there
shall be safe access to parking spaces, landscaped strips shall be arranged so
as to divide parking corridors and to limit cross movements through open
parking spaces. The minimum width of any landscaped area shall be 5 feet.
         C.   Credit for existing trees.  If in the judgment of the Zoning
Administrator it is deemed appropriate, credit may be received on the interior
landscaping plan by preserving existing trees capable of tolerating adjacent
construction. In order to maintain any tree deemed eligible for credit, 100% of
the ground area under and within the drip line of the tree shall be preserved
from the trunk out to the edge of the drip line, and shall be maintained in
either vegetative landscape material or pervious surface cover, except when the
Zoning Administrator determines that lesser areas and other ground cover
treatment will provide sufficient nourishment for the continued growth of the
preserved type of tree. The required number of new trees may be reduced in
accordance with the following schedule in exchange for preserving existing
trees:
 
                                                       Diameter of   Number of
Diameter of Existing Crown Spread of Preserved Tree*  Tree Trunk of Trees
OR                                                     Preserved     Credited
                                                       Tree**

40-49 feet         20-25 inches         4
30-39 feet         13-19 inches         3
20-29 feet         8-12 inches          2

* Rounded off to the nearest whole foot
** Measured at a height of 4-1/2 feet above the natural grade and rounded off
to the nearest whole inch
 
   (g)   Drainage.  All open off-street parking areas shall be provided with
adequate drainage facilities as approved by the City Engineer. This approval
will not be required for off-street parking for single-family or two-family
uses.
   (h)   Maintenance.  All parts of open off-street parking areas that are
landscaped shall be continuously maintained and kept in a well-manicured
condition.
   (i)   Marking.  Designated parking spaces shall be marked on the surface of
the parking area with paint or permanent marking materials and maintained in
clearly visible condition.

Passed 6-19-08.)
1262.05  UNITS OF MEASUREMENT FOR PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   For the purpose of determining off-street parking requirements, the
following units of measurement shall apply:
   (a)   Floor Area.  Floor area for nonresidential purposes shall be the sum
of the gross horizontal area of all the floors of a building measured from the
exterior faces of the exterior walls or from the center line of walls
separating 2 buildings.
   (b)   Hospital Bassinets.  In hospitals, bassinets shall not be counted as
beds.
   (c)   Places of Public Assembly.
      (1)   Benches.  In stadiums, sports arenas, churches, and other places of
assembly in which those in attendance occupy benches, pews, or other similar
seating facilities, every 24 inches of such seating facilities shall be counted
as 1 seat for the purpose of determining the off-street parking requirements of
this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Fixed seats and assembly area.  In cases where a place of assembly
has both fixed seats and open assembly area, requirements shall be computed
separately for each type and added together.
   (d)   Fractions.  When units of measurement determining the number of
required parking spaces result in requirement of a fractional space, any
fraction up to 1/2 shall be disregarded and fractions of over and including 1/
2 shall require one parking space.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1262.06  ADDITIONS TO BUILDINGS AND EXTENSIONS OF LAND USE.
   (a)   Whenever any addition to a building or extension of land use results
in an increase in the number of units used to measure required off-street
parking spaces, and the addition or extension creates a need for an increase of
more than 10% in the number of required off-street parking spaces, additional
off-street parking shall be provided on the basis of the increase in the number
of such units of measurement, according to the most recent provisions of
Chapter
1262.
   (b)   Exception.  In the case of additional dwelling units created by
conversion of an existing dwelling, 1 off-street parking space shall be
required for each additional dwelling unit so created.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1262.07  MIXED OCCUPANCIES AND USES NOT SPECIFIED.
   (a)   In the case of mixed uses involving any use listed in Section
1262.02(a) and/or mixed permitted uses, the total requirements for off-street
parking facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses
computed separately. Where a use is not specifically mentioned in Section
1262.02, the requirements for a use that is so mentioned and to which said use
is similar, in the determination of the Zoning Administrator, shall apply. Off-
street parking facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing
requirements for any other use, except as specified for joint  use or shared
parking.
   (b)   In the case of mixed uses involving any use listed in Section
1262.02(a) and/or mixed permitted uses where parking spaces required by this
chapter will not primarily be in use at the same time, the Zoning Administrator
may permit shared parking between the uses listed in Section
1262.02(a) and/or mixed permitted uses. Shared parking may result in fewer
total parking spaces needed when compared to the total number of spaces needed
for each use listed in Section
1262.02(a) and/or mixed permitted use calculated separately.

   Sections
1262.01 through
1262.07 shall apply to this section but shall not be construed to prevent
collective provision of off-street parking facilities for two or more buildings
or uses. However, the requirements set forth in Section
1262.03 as to maximum distances between parking areas and establishments served
shall apply to each establishment participating in the collective provisions of
parking. Approval of collective parking shall be conditioned on the production
of documentation that perpetual access to such parking is legally assured for
all participating uses.

   (b)   Octave band analyzers calibrated in the preferred frequencies
(American Standards Association S1, 6-1960, Preferred Frequencies for
Acoustical Measurements) shall be used with Table I (A through D). Octave band
analyzers calibrated with pre-1960 Octave band (American Standards Association
Z24-10-1953, Octave Band Filter Set) shall use Table IIA through IID in 
Sections
1264.04 through
1264.06.  For impact sounds measured with the impact noise analyzer, the sound
pressure levels set forth in Tables IA through ID and IIA through IID may be
increased by 6 decibels in each octave band.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)

Section shall be submitted as part of the site plan review.
      (2)   Existing Uses. Any existing nonresidential or multifamily use
installing new outdoor lighting fixtures or the replacement of existing outdoor
fixtures. Replacement of a fixture shall mean a change of fixture type or
change to the mounting height or location of the fixture. Routine lighting
maintenance, such as changing lamps or light bulbs, ballast, starter, photo
control, housing, lenses, and other similar components, shall not constitute
replacement and shall be permitted, provided such changes do not result in a
higher lumen output.
         A.   Applicants for all qualifying existing uses under this Subsection
shall submit a lighting plan to the Zoning Administrator for review and
approval. Such plan shall contain the information required under this Section
and must show that the applicable lighting standards have been satisfied.

1268.01  INTENT AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   It is the intent of this chapter to accommodate creative and
imaginative Planned Unit Developments (hereinafter referred to as PUDs) and to
permit those innovations in the technology of land development that are in the
best interest of the City. In order to accomplish this intent, it is the
purpose of a PUD District to permit, in a carefully designed development, a
variety of uses and/or dwelling types, and to permit the flexible spacing of
lots and buildings, the conservation of natural features of the landscape, the
provision of accessible and enjoyable open spaces, and the provision of a
necessary or desirable complement of community and neighborhood facilities.
   (b)   In addition to the authority and duties expressly set forth in this
chapter, the Planning Commission shall have the continuing authority to review,
and to approve or deny changes in buildings, grounds and land uses within the
PUD, to assure that the development originally approved is not negatively
affected by such changes.
   (c)   It is the further intent of this Zoning Code that Planned Unit
Development zoning be applied only in situations where conventional zoning is
inappropriate or unduly restrictive. In many situations, conventional zoning
will fully satisfy the objectives of the City's Master Land Use Plan.
Therefore, whether or not to grant PUD zoning is within the sound discretion of
the Planning Commission and City Council.
   (d)   The landowner who applies for PUD zoning is voluntarily agreeing to
exchange the fixed requirements and privileges of conventional zoning for the
opportunity to negotiate different requirements and privileges with the
Planning Commission, subject to approval by the City Council. In that
negotiation, the Planning Commission shall have authority to consider, approve
or reject any and all physical features of the proposed development and any and
all proposed land uses therein.
   (e)   All uses within Planned Unit Development zoning districts are subject
to further regulation under Chapters
1254 through
1280 of this Zoning Code and as otherwise provided by law, except where
different standards are both: (1) approved by the City within the PUD approval
process; and (2) documented on the final development plan or record plan.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.02  PERMITTED USES; CATEGORIES OF PUDS.
   An application for PUD zoning shall specify the land use category being
requested. An application may specify areas proposed to be developed under
different PUD categories or under combinations of PUD categories and
conventional zoning. Once PUD zoning is approved, land uses are limited by two
factors:  (1) the PUD category for which application was made; and (2) the
authority and discretion of the Planning Commission, in its approval of the
general plan and/or final development plan, to determine which of the allowable
uses in the category may be permitted, in what combination, intensity and
location, and under what conditions. PUDs may be applied for under any of the
following land use categories:
   (a)   Planned Unit Development–Residential (PUD-R) may allow any permitted
use in any Residential Zoning District;
   (b)   Planned Unit Development–Office (PUD-O) may allow any permitted use in
any Office Zoning District;
   (c)   Planned Unit Development–Commercial (PUD-C) may allow any permitted
use in any Commercial Zoning District;
   (d)   Planned Unit Development–Industrial (PUD-I) may allow any permitted
use in any Manufacturing Zoning District; and
   (e)   Planned Unit Development–Mixed Use (PUD-MU) may allow any combination
of any permitted uses in any commercial, manufacturing, office, or residential
zoning district.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.03  AREA, DENSITY AND LOT REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Minimum Area for Development.  A PUD shall contain a minimum of 1
acre. All land within the development shall be contiguous in that it shall not
be divided into segments by a limited access highway or by a tract of land,
other than streets or rights-of-way for public or private utility transmission
lines, not owned by the landowner of the PUD.
   (b)   Density of Development.  A PUD shall not exceed the gross density
permitted in the conventional zoning district most similar in nature and
function to the pertinent portion of the PUD, as determined by the Planning
Commission, with the following exceptions:
      (1)   All densities are to be determined on the basis of gross dwelling
units per acre, excluding such acreage as is used for nonresidential purposes,
as determined by the Commission.
      (2)   Densities may be increased by the Commission in the net project
area where the factors listed herein make a substantial improvement in the PUD:
         A.   Landscaping; streetscape; open spaces and plazas; use of existing
landscape; pedestrian way treatment; and residential areas;
         B.   Setting, visual focus points; use of existing physical features
such as topography; view of sun and wind orientation; circulation pattern;
physical environment; variation in building setbacks; and building groups (such
as clustering);
         C.   Design features; street sections; architectural styles;
harmonious use of materials; parking areas broken by landscape features; and
varied use of building types;
         D.   Common open space above the district requirements; or
         E.   Availability of contiguous publicly-owned open space, off-street
parking, storm water retention basins and other facilities that reduce the need
for such facilities within the PUD.
   (c)   Minimum Requirements.
      (1)   Dwelling unit size, yard setback, type of dwelling unit, frontage
and use restrictions, as established by conventional zoning may be waived for
PUDs, provided that the intent and objectives of the Land Use Master Plan are
complied with in the total development plan, as determined by the Commission.
Building separation shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of
the Fire Prevention Code and other safety codes of the City and in accordance
with good design principles.
      (2)   Every dwelling unit shall have continuous paved pedestrian access
to adequate vehicle parking facilities conveniently located nearby.
   (d)   Perimeter Requirements.  If topographical or other barriers within the
development do not provide reasonable privacy for existing uses adjacent to the
development, the Commission shall impose either of the following requirements,
or both:
      (1)   Structures located on the perimeter of the development must be set
back in accordance with the provisions of the conventional zoning district most
similar in nature and function to the portion of the PUD in which the structure
within the development is situated.
      (2)   Structures located on the perimeter of the development must be well
screened in a manner approved by the Commission.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.04  INTERIOR STREETS.
   (a)   Interior streets shall be constructed according to City structural
specifications, as delineated in the Subdivision Regulations, and properly
lighted and maintained to conform with City ordinances. Their minimum paved
roadway widths shall ordinarily be as delineated in the Subdivision Regulations
and in the Thoroughfare Plan.  However, approval of interior access streets
with different nonstructural dimensions will be considered by the Planning
Commission and Council where the developer can demonstrate substantial
compliance with the Subdivision Regulations and Thoroughfare Plan and receive
approval from the City Engineer. Approval of the PUD with such differences will
constitute lawful approval of a waiver of the Subdivision Regulations and
Thoroughfare Plan. Where streets are constructed pursuant to such a waiver,
such streets shall be privately owned and maintained, and shall be constructed
entirely within a public access easement. All public access easements shall be
designated on the general plan, the final development plan, and the record plan
for each section of the development.
   (b)   On the record plan, the following covenants shall appear which
establish the rights and responsibilities of the property owner and the City
with regard to public access easements:
      (1)   To ensure the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of
the city, private drives constructed within designated public access easements
shall be open and accessible to fire, police and other emergency and
maintenance vehicles at all times. Streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, tree
lawns and other improvements within these easements shall be continuously
maintained by the owner in good repair and kept free from all obstructions that
would impede the free movement of public traffic, including but not limited to
ice, snow and parked vehicles. Where necessary, in accordance with a traffic
control plan approved by the City Engineer, traffic control devices shall be
provided, installed and maintained by the owner. To ensure compliance with
traffic control devices in public access easements, the City shall have full
power and authority to enforce such controls and to prosecute violators in
accord with municipal and state law.
      (2)   No public access easement shall be blocked for any purpose without
prior approval of the City.
      (3)   In the event that the owner of a public access easement fails to
fulfill the obligations set forth in these covenants, conditions and
restrictions, the City is hereby authorized, after providing reasonable notice
and opportunity for hearing to the owner of the fee interest in the easement
area, to take such corrective action as it deems necessary, to charge the fee
owner for the entire cost thereof, and in the event of failure of prompt
payment, to collect said costs as a special assessment against the property.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.05  COLLECTOR STREETS AND MAJOR THOROUGHFARES.
   Collector streets and major thoroughfares shall be designated as such by the
developer upon the submission of the general plan. Such designations shall be
subject to modification by the Planning Commission so that an efficient
circulation system is established in relation to other existing or planned
streets in the area. There shall be no direct access from single-family
residential lots to a major thoroughfare, and direct access from single-family
residential lots to collector streets shall be minimized.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.06  OFF-STREET PARKING.
   There shall be provided outside the public or private right-of-way the
minimum number of parking spaces required in Chapter
1262 of this Zoning Code. Where appropriate, common driveways, parking areas,
walks and steps shall be provided, maintained and lighted for night use.
Screening of parking or service areas may be required through ample use of
trees, shrubs, hedges and screening devices. All parking spaces and service
drives shall be improved with bituminous, concrete or equivalent surfacing and
so graded and drained to properly collect all surface water accumulation within
the area. All paved areas in PUD districts shall be curbed to City street
specifications unless waived by the Planning Commission for good cause.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.07  COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   (a)   Amount and Character.
      (1)   For PUD-R.  A minimum of 25% of the total acreage in a proposed
development permitted by this chapter shall be dedicated to public and/or
private open space or recreation facilities available to all occupants of the
PUD. This open space shall not include dwellings, streets, parking areas, or
residential lots. Such open space shall be clearly shown on the general plan
and shall be physically situated so as to be readily accessible, available to
and usable by all residents of the PUD. Water retention and detention areas may
be included in common open space if attractively developed.
      (2)   For PUD-O, PUD-C, PUD-I, and the nonresidential portions of PUD-
MU.  Common open space of at least 25% shall be required, unless waived by the
Planning Commission for good cause. The Planning Commission shall establish the
percentage of the lot dedicated as open space for all lots. This open space
shall not include structures, roadways and other paved areas, and other
impervious surfaces.
   (b)   Conveyance and Maintenance.  All common open space, shown on the final
development plan and recorded in the office of the Recorder of Butler County,
must be conveyed in accordance with the following methods, at the option of the
Planning Commission:
      (1)   A.   By leasing or conveying title, including beneficial ownership,
to a corporation, homeowner's association or other legal entity. The terms of
such lease or other instrument of conveyance must include provisions
satisfactory to the Commission for guaranteeing:
            1.   The continued use of such land for its specified purposes;
            2.   Continuity of proper maintenance;
            3.   Availability of funds required for such maintenance;
            4.   Adequate insurance protection; and
            5.   Recovery for loss sustained by casualty, condemnation or
otherwise.
         B.   The developer shall provide to the City at the time the record
plan is filed for City review and approval, executed legal documents which
create the aforesaid guarantees and, in particular, which will restrict the use
of common open space to the specified purposes.
      (2)   By dedication to the City as publicly owned and maintained open
space. All common open space proposed for dedication to the City must be
acceptable with regard to size, shape, location and improvement. The City
Council shall not accept such dedications unless the open space will be of
substantial use and benefit not only to occupants of the PUD, but also to the
greater Trenton community. Acceptance of such dedications by the City shall be
in the City Council's sole discretion, and the City shall have no obligation to
accept any such dedication, regardless of its merit.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.08  OPEN SPACE PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT.
   One of the principal purposes of these Planned Unit Development regulations
is to encourage the preservation of natural watercourses and wooded areas, and
the attractive development of lawn areas for human enjoyment. With creative
planning, often involving the clustering of buildings, these purposes can be
very compatible with the developer's desire to achieve an unusually attractive
and functional project at a reasonable cost. The Planning Commission seeks to
be a creative partner in achieving these mutual goals.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.09  PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE CIRCULATION.
   A well designed pedestrian and bicycle circulation system is essential and
should be separated as completely and as reasonably as possible from the
vehicular street system in order to provide pedestrian and bicycle safety and
freedom of vehicular movement. This system shall be designed to serve the
pedestrian and bicycle needs of surrounding neighborhoods as well as the PUD.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.10  UNDERGROUND UTILITIES REQUIRED.
   Each PUD that is primarily non-manufacturing in character shall provide for
uniform underground installation of utilities, including, for example,
electricity, telephone, and cable television. In PUDs that are primarily
manufacturing in character, utilities shall be installed as approved by the
Planning Commission. Utility installation and maintenance of facilities shall
be in accordance with the requirements and regulations of the City and of the
utility authority having the right of installation and maintenance. A PUD shall
not be approved unless adequate assurance is given that adequate public or
central water and sanitary sewers will be available at the first occupancy.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.11  PRIVACY.
   (a)   Each PUD shall provide reasonable visual and acoustical privacy for
dwelling units within the PUD and on parcels contiguous to the PUD. Fences,
insulation, walls, barriers and landscaping shall be used, as appropriate, for
the protection and aesthetic enhancement of property and the privacy of its
occupants, the screening of objectionable views or uses and the reduction of
noise.
   (b)   High-rise buildings shall be located within a PUD in such a way as to
dissipate any adverse impact on adjoining low-rise buildings and shall not
invade the privacy of the occupants of such low-rise buildings. In PUDs that
are not primarily residential in character, these requirements may be relaxed
as the Planning Commission finds appropriate.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.12  EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
   Effective erosion and sedimentation controls shall be planned and applied
according to the following principles:
   (a)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at anyone time
during development.
   (b)   When land is exposed during development, the exposure should be kept
to the shortest practical period of time.
   (c)   Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect critical
areas exposed during development.
   (d)   Sediment basins (debris basins or silt traps) shall be installed and
maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing
development.
   (e)   Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by
changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.
   (f)   Permanent final vegetation and structures shall be installed as soon
as practical in the development.
   (g)   The development shall be fitted to the topography and soils so as to
create the least erosion potential.
   (h)   Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and
protected. Development of the PUD must conform to the any City tree ordinance
that may be in effect at the time the general plan is submitted.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.13  SUBDIVISION REVIEW; CONFLICTS.
   The process of application, review and approval of a PUD shall include the
plans, documentation, subdivider's contract and performance guarantees required
in the subdivision regulations for the final approval and recording of
subdivisions. The Planning Commission and Council may deviate from the
substantive requirements of the Subdivision Regulations and Zoning Code only to
the extent necessary to achieve the functional and aesthetic objectives of the
PUD. Through the PUD approval process, the subdivider acquires only those
special rights, privileges and concessions that are expressly granted.
Otherwise, the developer must conform to the requirements of the most
restrictive conventional zoning category which is encompassed by the PUD zoning
category as set forth in Section
1268.02.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.14  ESTABLISHMENT OF PUD.
   Application for a PUD shall be processed through 3 mandatory steps:
   (a)   Step 1: Approval of the General Plan and Amendment of the Official
Zoning Map. Application for a zoning change to PUD shall include a general plan
conforming to the requirements of Section
1268.16(d). Approval procedures for Step 1 of the PUD process are set forth in
Section
1268.16. Approval requires action by both the Planning Commission and City
Council.
   (b)   Step 2: Final Development Plan. A final development plan shall be
prepared in conformance with the approved general plan and in accordance with
the requirements of Section
1268.19. Approval procedures for Step 2 of the PUD process are set forth in
Sections
1268.20 and
1268.21. Approval requires action by the Planning Commission only.
   (c)   Step 3: Record Plan.  A record plan shall be developed in accordance
with the approved final development plan and in accordance with the
requirements set forth in Section
1268.22. Approval requires action by both the Planning Commission and City
Council.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.15  PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE RECOMMENDED.
   To obtain information regarding the PUD approval process, requirements, and
other information relative to the PUD application, each applicant is highly
encouraged to engage in informal consultations with the Planning Commission or
its designated officer prior to filing an application. The applicant should be
prepared to discuss the general concept of the PUD, with a conceptual plan.
Thereafter, the Planning Commission or its designated officer shall furnish the
applicant with written comments regarding such conference, including
appropriate recommendations to inform and assist the applicant prior to his or
her preparation of the components of the PUD zoning application. It is not
required that a person requesting a pre-application conference be a legal owner
or holder of an equitable interest in the subject property.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.16  PUD APPLICATION STEP 1: APPLICATION FOR GENERAL PLAN APPROVAL AND
AMENDMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   (a)   Application for PUD zoning shall be made by the property owner or his
or her authorized agent in the same manner as a request for any other zoning
district designation. The rezoning application shall indicate the category of
PUD (PUD-C, PUD-R, etc.)  requested. PUD zoning cannot be initiated by the City
without the written permission of the property owner.
   (b)   The general plan, which shall be set forth in one or more maps or
instruments, shall be signed by all owners of property within the project,
shall be drawn to scale and shall be signed by an architect, landscape
architect, civil engineer, or planner-in-charge authorized to practice in the
State. Approval of a general plan is a necessary precondition to consideration
and approval of the final development plan.
   (c)   All general plans shall be presented to the Planning Commission by
means of an application in the form prescribed by the Zoning Administrator. The
City shall charge for processing of the application based on its actual costs
incurred, including in-house processing and review and/or processing and review
by public and private consultants. All such costs incurred until and including
filing of the record plan shall be invoiced. An initial deposit of one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) shall be payable upon application and shall be credited
toward the actual costs of processing. All work done prior to formal
application shall be charged to the project upon submission of the application.
The developer will be billed monthly, or less frequently if deemed appropriate
by the City. Failure to pay such bills within 30 days shall be deemed just
cause for delaying further approvals relative to the PUD application and/or
construction. Any unused portion of the initial deposit shall be returned to
the applicant following the filing of the record plan with the County Recorder
or upon other termination of the application process.

(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.17  GENERAL PLAN APPROVAL, AMENDMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   (a)   The Planning Commission shall review the application for amendment of
the official zoning map with the proposed general plan and may recommend the
zoning map amendment and general plan to City Council if it determines that the
plan satisfies, at a minimum, all of the following criteria:
      (1)   PUD zoning and the general plan are in conformance with the
Comprehensive Land Use Master Plan for the City, supporting special purpose
plans, and related legislation as adopted by City Council;
      (2)   An exemption to conventional zoning is justified because the
Comprehensive Land Use Master Plan for the City can be more faithfully and
reliably implemented by the use of PUD zoning;
      (3)   The general plan is compatible with the location, topographic and
other characteristics of the site and will bear a beneficial relationship with
surrounding land uses in terms of noise, smoke, dust, debris, or other
nuisances;
      (4)   The general plan is carefully designed to support surrounding
streets, utilities and other public improvements;
      (5)   The general plan represents an efficient and economic use of the
land in view of the community's need for a balance of land uses;
      (6)   All public streets, utilities and services necessary to carry out
the general plan are available to the site, or will be extended or improved by
the developer and/or City in time to permit the development to be properly
served;
      (7)   Exception from conventional zoning is warranted by design goals or
other criteria and/or the need to provide a variety of development
opportunities within the community;
      (8)   The design of the development protects natural assets such as
streams, wood lots, steep terrain, and other critical environments in the City;
      (9)   Taken as a whole the development of the proposed PUD will have a
positive effect on the health, safety, and general welfare of the City;
      (10)   The general plan appears capable of being implemented by a final
development plan which meets all requirements of this chapter; and
      (11)   Implementation of the general plan will be initiated within 1 year
of approval.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall make a formal recommendation to the City
Council regarding the proposed general plan and the application for amendment
of the official zoning map in accordance with Section
1250.01 and this Section
1268.17. After receipt of the recommendation, City Council shall act on the
recommendation in accordance with Ohio R.C. 713.12 and Section
1250.01 of this Zoning Code.
   (c)   The General Plan need not be recorded in the records of Butler County.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.18  REVISION OF APPROVED GENERAL PLAN.
   The final development plan shall substantially conform to the approved
general plan. In the preparation of the final development plan, the applicant
shall not materially deviate from the approved general plan or to the related
documents.  Major changes to the general plan (see definition of "Major Change"
in Section
1242.01) may not be made unless and until a revised general plan is processed
and approved in accordance with this chapter. Minor changes may be approved by
the Planning Commission without submission of the revised general plan to City
Council.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.19  PUD APPLICATION STEP 2: FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   Before any part of a PUD subdivision may be reflected in a record plan and
recorded, the improvements and uses previously described in an approved general
plan must be merged and detailed in a final development plan. No final
development plan shall be considered or approved without formal approval by
City Council of both the amendment to the Official Zoning Map and the general
plan. Once these approvals have been received, the owner may seek approval for
a final development plan for the overall PUD, for sections of the PUD, or for
individual parcels. The last alternative may be particularly appropriate where
lot sizes may depend on the particular needs of prospective purchasers, and
those purchasers are unknown at the time the general plan is approved. The
final development plan shall show the following, in addition to those items
required in the general plan:
   (a)   The area to be developed and the area to be devoted to open space for
the use of all residents of the PUD, with accurate acreage, courses and
distances, as determined by a engineer or surveyor licensed in the state of
Ohio who shall sign such plan and certify to the accuracy thereof. The
boundaries of any area for which final development plan approval is requested
shall not be gerrymandered to comply with the density and open space acreage
criteria but shall be proportioned so that required open space is convenient to
the properties included in the area submitted for final approval;
   (b)   The location and floor plans of all buildings, descriptive data as to
land elevation drawings detailing the type of buildings, the number of dwelling
units in each separate type and the number of bedrooms per unit of apartment
(multi-family dwelling) buildings, and the number of bedrooms in each apartment
unit;
   (c)   Clear designations of nonresidential, mixed use and residential
buildings, of nonresidential and residential spaces within buildings, and of
the kinds of nonresidential land uses permissible within the nonresidential
spaces, as approved by the Planning Commission;
   (d)   A title guarantee or rider to an existing policy, prepared by a
reputable title company, showing the legal description of the land which has
been set aside for open space and showing appropriate restrictions, limiting
the use of such land to recreation and open space in perpetuity and granting
owners and residents of the area to be developed a right to an easement of use
in such open space;
   (e)   A detailed plan setting forth the manner, means and proposed time of
transfer of the land reserved for open space to a nonprofit entity and the
obligations and rights of use of such open space by all residents of the area;
and
   (f)   Assured provisions for continuously and adequately financing the
expenses of the nonprofit entity.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.20  CONDITIONS FOR APPROVAL OF FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   The Planning Commission shall review each final development plan and
approve, modify and approve, or disapprove the plan and transmit notice thereof
to the applicant within a reasonable time. The Commission shall give the final
approval of uses only upon finding that the following requirements are met:
   (a)   No requirement of this chapter, as existing at the time of general
plan approval, is violated by the final development plan;
   (b)   The final development plan accurately sets forth the area to be
developed and the area to be set aside as open space with appropriate
boundaries established by course and distances, and the acreage within the area
to be approved is set forth as well as the acreage of the area to be set aside
as open space for the use of all residents of the area;
   (c)   The final development plan is substantially in accordance with the
general plan that had been previously filed with and approved by the Commission
and City Council;
   (d)   The density of dwelling units in any area of the PUD does not exceed
that shown on the general plan by more than 10%, and any change is supported by
appropriate reasons, and the overall density of the PUD district as set forth
in the general plan has not been exceeded;
   (e)   The area reserved for open space and recreation satisfies the
provisions of Sections
1268.07 and
1268.08;
   (f)   Satisfactory progress has been made under any previously approved
final development plan with respect to the provision and improvement of
indicated open space and recreational facilities;
   (g)   The final development plan accurately sets forth a schedule
demonstrating proportionate development of the open space and recreational
facilities in conjunction with the total project. A performance bond may be
allowed to substitute for actual construction. Any construction covered by a
performance bond shall be completed within one year. The amenities included in
each phase shall be substantially completed prior to the issuance of occupancy
permits; and
   (h)   All areas designated for public acceptance are conceptually
satisfactory to the City, including public access easements.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.21  FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPROVAL.
   The Planning Commission shall approve, modify and approve, or deny an
application for approval of a final development plan within a reasonable time
after the date of such application. Upon approval of the final development plan
by the Commission, the Commission shall:
   (a)   Furnish the developer with written notice of approval;
   (b)   Authorize the issuance of a zoning certificate for each structure
indicated in the approved final development plan; and
   (c)   See to it that the final development plan is recorded. The recorded
final development plan shall incorporate the approved general plan by
reference. Approval of a final development plan does not obligate the City
Council to approve the record plan. Planning Commission approval of a final
development plan is a necessary precondition to consideration and approval of a
record plan.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.22  PUD APPLICATION STEP 3: RECORD PLAN.
   (a)   Within 6 months of approval of the final development plan for any
specific area within the project or for the overall project, a record plan for
the area shown on the final development plan shall be submitted in accordance
with Chapter
1214 of the Subdivision Regulations.
   (b)   Documents.  At the time record plans are filed with the Planning
Commission, the developer shall also file:
      (1)   Cost estimates for all public improvements in the subdivision plan;
and
      (2)   Other documents and assurances required by the Subdivision
Regulations.
   (c)   Final Approval by Planning Commission.  Within 60 days after the
record plan is filed, with all necessary documents and exhibits, the Commission
shall approve, approve and modify or disapprove the record plan and forward its
recommendation to City Council.

Commission of the record plan, Council shall approve, modify and approve, or
disapprove it.
   (e)   Recording.  Upon Council approval of the record plan, the Commission
shall notify the applicant. Upon payment of the required fee by the applicant
and compliance with all subdivision regulations. the developer shall within 10
days thereafter file the record plan with the Butler County Recorder. The
developer shall record the approved final development plan simultaneously with
the record plan.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.23  FAILURE TO BEGIN OR CONTINUE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   The construction of a subdivision under PUD zoning is authorized by a
subdivider's agreement between the City and the land owner. This agreement,
regardless of its form, is a contract intended to assure the orderly
construction of a complete, well planned development. Should the land owner
breach this contract by abandoning construction or failing to proceed with the
development at the pace agreed upon, the City shall be entitled to implement
certain remedies as follows:
   (a)   If a complete record plan approval application is not submitted within
3 months of the approval of a final development plan, the final development
plan shall be null and void. The Commission, for good cause, may extend for
consecutive periods of 6 months or less the time for submitting the record plan
application.
   (b)   If no construction has begun in the PUD within 6 months after the
recording of a record plan for the overall project or any part thereof, the
record plan may be vacated by resolution of the City Council and be of no
further effect. The Commission, for good cause and in its sole discretion, may
extend for periods of up to 6 months the time for beginning construction.
   (c)   Should a land owner who has been authorized to develop a PUD under
this chapter, or under any previous PUD regulations of the City, sell or
otherwise convey ownership of any part of that PUD to another before all
planned public improvements such as streets, curb cuts, and utilities are
constructed therein in accord with plans and specifications approved by the
City, and/or before all lands required for the public use therein have been
dedicated to the City, that land owner shall be deemed to have abandoned that
portion of the PUD and to have breached all agreements with the City to the
extent that they relate to development of the portion sold. In case of such
abandonment and breach, the City may, pursuant to a recommendation by the
Planning Commission and approval by the City Council, pursue any of the
following remedies or any others available to it under the law:
      (1)   Enforce the subdivider's contract executed by the breaching owner,
if such contract exists.
      (2)   Withdraw its approval of all plans for that portion of the PUD and
require any subsequent owner desiring to develop the site to begin with
submission of a proposed new general plan under the current regulations. This
remedy may be particularly appropriate when the new land owner intends to be a
subdivider of the conveyed property.
      (3)   In a situation where the new owner wishes to continue the
development of a subdivision, require the new owner to execute a subdivider's
contract, performance bond and all other documents and assurances required by
the City under the current regulations to guarantee those dedications and
public improvements which were not completed by the former owner.
   (d)   In the event that the new owner and the City agree to implement the
third alternative, the new owner may proceed in accord with the approved final
development plan, under the provisions of this chapter. If for any reason the
subdivision has not received approval of a general plan, final development plan
and record plan, the new owner shall enter the review process set forth in this
chapter to obtain any approval not obtained by the previous owner. Thereafter,
the new owner shall not deviate from the approved plans except through the
revision procedures of Section
1268.18, or by requesting and receiving a change of zoning classification.
   (e)   If an approved record plan is vacated as provided herein, notice of
such vacation shall be filed in the records of the Butler County Recorder by
the Commission, and no development may proceed on any part of the included
lands until such time as a new final development plan and record plan have been
submitted and approved.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.24  REVISION OF APPROVED FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   The record plan shall conform to the approved final development plan. The
applicant and his or her successors and assigns shall make no alterations,
addition or deletions to the approved final development plan or to the related
documents. Major changes may not be made unless and until a revised final
development plan is processed and approved in accordance with this chapter. If
a major change materially alters any feature of the project for which a
submittal was required for general plan approval, revision of the general plan
and review by the City Council shall be required. Minor changes may be approved
by the Planning Commission without submission of a revised final development
plan.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.25  PHASING.
   The establishment of common open spaces and the construction of public or
common residential facilities shown on the recorded final development plan,
together with the construction of other nonresidential structures, shall
proceed substantially in accordance with the phasing program submitted pursuant
to Section
1268.16(d)(4). After construction commences, the developer shall submit
progress reports every 6 months to the Zoning Administrator, who shall review
all building permits issued and compare them to the approved phasing program.
If it is determined that the rate or sequence of construction of the PUD
substantially differs from the phasing program, the Zoning Administrator shall
so notify the developer in writing. Upon receipt of a recommendation by the
Zoning Administrator, the Commission may issue such orders to the developer as
it sees fit, and, upon continued violation of this section, may suspend the
developer from further construction of dwelling units or nonresidential
structures until compliance is achieved or a revised phasing program is
submitted and approved.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
1268.26  ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY FOR FAILURE TO CONFORM TO FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN
   Whenever the Planning Commission finds, in the case of an approved final
development plan, that any term, condition or restriction incorporated into the
plan is not being complied with or performed, the Planning Commission may
rescind and revoke such approval. Notice of intent to revoke shall be served
upon the owner(s) by certified mail, return receipt requested and by regular
first-class mail, giving opportunity for a hearing before the Planning
Commission. Following opportunity for a hearing, revocation may be certified by
the Chairman of the Planning Commission upon authorization by a majority of the
Commission's membership. Notice of certification of such revocation shall be
promptly recorded in the land records of Butler County. This administrative
remedy is in addition to all other remedies and penalties for violation of this
Zoning Code that are provided for herein or otherwise as a matter of law.
(Ord. 16-2003.  Passed 5-1-03.)
CHAPTER 1270
Access Management Regulations for Nonresidential and Multi-Family Uses
1270.01   Intent and purpose.
1270.02   Scope of applicability and review.
1270.03   General access connection and driveway design.
1270.04   Joint access and cross access design standards.
1270.05   Internal service road design standards.
1270.06   Unified access and circulation design standards.
1270.07   Corner clearance design standards.
1270.08   Shared parking standards.
1270.09   Number of permitted driveways.
1270.10   Deviations from access spacing requirements.
1270.11   Traffic impact study requirements.
1270.01  INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   The primary objectives of these access management regulations are to promote
traffic safety and efficiency, preserve future rights-of-way, maintain proper
traffic capacity and traffic flow, reduce interferences with public travel,
protect the public's interest in its rights-of-way, and to provide for the
efficient and uniform administration of the public road rights-of-way.  These
regulations further the orderly layout and use of land, and can serve to
protect the Trenton community character and natural resources by promoting
well-designed road and access systems and discouraging the unplanned
development and re-development of land.  Specific purposes are as follows:
   (a)   To protect the safety of motorists traveling on city roads and their
crossroad intersections and preserve the efficiency of traffic flow along
roadways.
   (b)   To protect the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists and provide for
pedestrian facilities in appropriate locations.
   (c)   To encourage development on the corridor that is compatible with or
does not detract from the aesthetic character or natural beauty of the
surrounding area.
   (d)   To preserve and enhance development options by promoting consolidation
of small, irregular lots into larger, more developable properties and promoting
development of unified access and circulation systems that serve more than one
property.
   (e)   To assure that driveways and street connections to city roads are
designed according to standards, have adequate sight distance for safe entry
and exit, and are adequately spaced in accordance with the access spacing
requirements set forth in these regulations.
(Ord. 01-2018.  Passed 1-18-18.)
1270.02  SCOPE OF APPLICABILITY AND REVIEW.
   These access management regulations shall apply to the location and design
of any public roadway and any private street and driveway proposed to access
the City of Trenton public roadway system unless roadway jurisdiction is
provided to another reviewing agency per the Ohio Revised Code.  These access
management regulations shall also apply to other development and redevelopment
events as specified below.
   (a)   Relationship to Development Applications.
      (1)   Major and Minor Subdivisions.  These access management regulations
shall apply to both major subdivision and minor subdivision applications.
      (2)   Site Plans.  These access management regulations shall apply to any
site plan review of a nonresidential or multi-family development project.
   (b)   Change in Use.
      (1)   Properties that do not meet these access management requirements
shall be brought into compliance with the regulations contained herein when
modifications to the roadway are made or when there is a significant change in
the use of the property.  For the purposes of this Chapter, a change of use
upon land or within a structure or a facility occurs when the vehicle trip
generation of the property is increased by 25% (either peak hour or daily) over
the vehicle trip amount generated by the prior use.  The change of use must
also generate a total of at least 100 trips per day.  One of the following
methods shall be used by the City Engineer to determine if a change of use has
occurred:
         A.   An estimation based on the latest edition of "Trip Generation" by
the Institute of Transportation Engineers for typical land uses; or
         B.   Traffic counts made at similar traffic generators located in the
area; or
         C.   Actual traffic monitoring conducted during the peak hour of the
adjacent roadway traffic for the property.
   (c)   Nonconforming Access.
      (1)   Any access to a public roadway which is legally in existence as of
the effective date of these access management regulations and does not conform
to these standards shall be considered a "nonconforming access."  A
nonconforming access may continue to be used indefinitely, but shall be
retrofitted or otherwise brought into conformance with all applicable
requirements of these access management guidelines when:
         A.   The lot is subdivided, re-subdivided, developed, or redeveloped;
         B.   A new or relocated access is requested;
         C.   There is a substantial enlargement, improvement, or change in the
use of the property consistent with the criteria set forth in Section
1270.02(b);
         D.   The principal use of the property is discontinued, abandoned or
otherwise out of service for a continuous period 180 days as provided for in
Chapter 1254;
         E.   Any new or modified land use that increases trip generation by
25% or more and exceeding at least 100 trips per day, as calculated from
traffic data or the current Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) "Trip
Generation Manual."
   (d)   Review of Access Management Regulations.
      (1)   The review and approval process for these access management
regulations shall take place during the minor or major subdivision application
review, a site plan application review or any other administrative review for
which these access management regulations shall apply.
      (2)   In the event there is a conflict between access management or
related regulations found in this Chapter and the Trenton Subdivision
Regulations, the respective conflicting regulation found in these access
management regulations shall prevail.
(Ord. 01-2018.  Passed 1-18-18.)
1270.03  GENERAL ACCESS CONNECTION AND DRIVEWAY DESIGN.
   (a)   The length of driveways or "Throat Length" shall be designed in
accordance with the anticipated storage length for entering and exiting
vehicles to prevent vehicles from backing up into the flow of traffic on the
public roadway or causing unsafe conflicts with onsite circulation.
   Figure 1:  Illustration depicting the measurement to determine throat length
of an access drive.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4377.jpg]
 
   (b)    Drive way access shall align with an exist ing oppo sing drive way or
roadw ay where ver possib le.  The creat ion of new offset driveway patters
shall be discouraged unless shown to be necessitated by unique topographical or
other site related features or conditions.
   Figure 2:  Offset driveway designs shall be discouraged.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4381.jpg]
 
   (c)   Driveway design shall conform to the City of Trenton Subdivision
Regulations construction standards.
   (d)   All access points along a public roadway must satisfy the sight
distance requirements per the ODOT Location & Design Manual, Volume One.
   (e)   The length of driveways or "Throat Length" shall be designed in
accordance with the anticipated storage length for entering and exiting
vehicles to prevent vehicles from backing up into the flow of traffic on the
public roadway or causing unsafe conflicts with onsite circulation.
   (f)   Driveway approaches must be designed and located to provide an exiting
vehicle with an unobstructed view.  Unless a connection spacing deviation
request is granted as provided for in Section
1270.10, construction of full access driveways along acceleration and
deceleration lanes and tapers is prohibited due to potential for vehicular
weaving conflicts and obstructing the public roadway.
(Ord. 01-2018.  Passed 1-18-18.)
1270.04  JOINT ACCESS AND CROSS ACCESS DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Adjacent commercial or office properties and compatible major traffic
generators (i.e. multi-tenant retail developments, office and industrial parks,
multi-family residential uses, mixed-use developments, etc.) shall provide a
cross access drive and pedestrian access way to allow circulation between sites
(see Figure 4).  This requirement shall also apply to a new building site that
abuts an existing developed property unless the Planning Commission finds that
this would be clearly impractical based upon a showing of unique topography or
other site specific condition.
      (1)   Property owners shall record a cross access easement and a joint
maintenance agreement with the Butler County Recorder's Office.
   Figure 4:  Illustration of common cross access easement and shared driveway
design.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/d6eddc9122a1374ccd5b552fffaaaeb90981c318/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4383.jpg]
 
   (b)   Nonconforming Connection Permit.  Property owners that provide for
joint and cross access may be granted a nonconforming connection permit, where
necessary, to provide reasonable access until such time as the joint use
driveway and cross access drives may be provided with adjacent properties.  All
necessary easements and agreements shall be recorded with the deed to the
property, including:
      (1)   An easement allowing cross access to and from the adjacent
properties;
      (2)   An agreement to close and eliminate any pre-existing driveways
provided for access in the interim after construction of the joint-use
driveway; and
      (3)   A joint maintenance agreement defining maintenance responsibilities
of property owners that share the joint use driveway and cross access system.
   (c)   Service drives providing cross access shall be designed and
constructed with a minimum total width of 20 feet to accommodate a 2-way travel
aisle and designed to accommodate automobiles, service vehicles and loading
vehicles.
   (d)   Stub streets and other design features shall be encouraged to make it
visually obvious that the abutting properties may be tied in to provide cross-
access via a service drive.
(Ord. 01-2018.  Passed 1-18-18.)
1270.05  INTERNAL SERVICE ROAD DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Internal service roads may be required to provide adequate access to
multiple lots.  In particular, the Planning Commission may require the
development of internal service roads where such facilities can provide access
to signalized intersections, where service drives may minimize the number of
driveways, and as a means to ensure that traffic is able to more efficiently
and safely ingress and egress. Internal service roads shall consist of either
"frontage roads" or "reverse frontage roads" including the driveways that
connect to adjacent streets or parking areas.  All internal service roads shall
be designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with the following
standards:
      (1)   Location - Frontage roads and reverse frontage roads shall
generally be parallel to the front property line and may be located either in
front of, or behind, principal buildings and may be placed in required yards. 
In considering the most appropriate alignment for an internal service road, the
Planning Commission shall consider the setbacks of existing and/or proposed
buildings and anticipated traffic flow for the site.
      (2)   Alignment - The alignment of the service road can be refined to
meet the needs of the site and anticipated traffic conditions, provided the
resulting terminus allows the drive to be extended through the adjacent site
(s).  This determination may require use of aerial photographs, GIS property
maps, topographic information and other supporting documentation as required
for the respective development application.
   Figure 5:  Illustration depicting the use of a reverse frontage road.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4387.jpg]
 
      (3)   Access Easement - An internal service road shall be wholly located
within an access easement permitting traffic circulation between properties. 
The easement shall be recorded with the Butler County Recorder's Office as a
condition of approval.
         A.   In any development containing commercial, retail, service related
uses or mixed use developments containing a residential land use component, an
internal service road shall have a minimum pavement width of 24 feet, measured
face to face of curb with an approach width of 36 feet at intersections.
         B.   The frontage road or service drive shall be constructed to meet
the City of Trenton public street construction standards for base and thickness
of asphalt or concrete.
         C.   In any development containing residential land uses exclusively,
a frontage road shall have a minimum pavement width of 20 feet.  The Planning
Commission may waive the request of curb and gutters for an internal private
service road.
      (4)   Maintenance Agreement - The applicant proposing any internal
service road intended to be owned and maintained as a private roadway shall
record a maintenance agreement at the time of recordation of the access
easement.  The maintenance agreement shall delineate the parcels included
within the maintenance agreement area and provide for the routine maintenance,
repair and upkeep of the private roadway infrastructure and any associated
facilities.  The maintenance agreement shall run with the property and be
wholly enforced upon subsequent property owners served by the internal service
road.  A copy of the maintenance agreement evidencing proof of recordation
shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator prior to any work commencing on
the project.
(Ord. 01-2018.  Passed 1-18-18.)
1270.06  UNIFIED ACCESS AND CIRCULATION DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   In the interest of promoting unified access and circulation systems,
development sites under the same ownership or consolidated for the purposes of
development and comprised of more than 1 building site shall be considered
unified parcels for the purposes of compliance with these access management
requirements.  This shall also apply to phased development plans when site plan
reviews or subdivision plats are required.  Accordingly, the following
requirements shall apply:
      (1)   The number of access connections permitted shall be the minimum
number necessary to provide reasonable access to the overall site and not the
maximum available for that frontage.
      (2)   All easements and agreements required under this Chapter shall be
provided.
      (3)   Access to outparcels shall be internalized using the shared
circulation system and designed to avoid excessive movement across parking
aisles or queuing across surrounding parking and driving aisles.
   (b)   Where abutting properties are in different ownership and not part of
an overall development plan, cooperation between the various owners in
development of a unified access and circulation system shall be sought.  The
cross access requirements set forth in Section
1270.04 shall be provided for in anticipation of future adjacent development
and change of use projects.  However, only the building site(s) under
consideration for development approval shall be subject to the requirements of
this Section at the time of review.  Abutting properties shall be required to
provide unified access and circulation along with connection to cross access
easements when an event listed in Section
1270.02 initiates the applicability of these access management regulations.
(Ord. 01-2018.  Passed 1-18-18.)
1270.07  CORNER CLEARANCE DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Corner clearance is the distance from an intersection to the closest
driveway or street, measured from the intersection radius to the inside edge of
the driveway or street (see Figure 7).  The purpose of corner clearance
requirements is to preserve safe and efficient traffic movement within the
functional area of an intersection.
      (1)   Corner clearance spacing for connections to the public roadway
shall meet or exceed the minimum street connection spacing requirement of 100
feet as set forth in the Trenton Subdivision Regulations.  This 100 foot
minimum spacing requirement shall apply to both new public streets and private
roadways and driveways. 
   (b)   Additional corner clearance may be required where the traffic impact
analysis indicates it is needed due to the specific trip characteristics of the
development or the typical length of standing queues on the abutting roadway.
   (c)   When a property cannot meet the minimum corner clearance requirements
of this section due to a physical impediment found on the lot or adjacent
right-of-way area, the Planning Commission may modify the corner clearance
standards where joint access is established with an abutting property, as
provided for in Section
1270.10.
   Figure 7:  Illustration of the corner clearance measurement determination.

(Ord. 01-2018.  Passed 1-18-18.)
1270.08  SHARED PARKING STANDARDS.
   (a)   Shared parking facilities and driveways shall be provided where
feasible and the parking space requirements reduced where shared parking is
designed to maximize complimentary use and it has been demonstrated to the
Planning Commission that sufficient parking will be available when it is needed
subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   Non-Overlapping Hours of Operation.  Two or more nonresidential
uses may jointly provide and use parking spaces when their peak hours of
operation do not normally overlap, provided that a written agreement is
submitted to the Zoning Administrator prior to the commencement of any
construction on the project.
      (2)   Overlapping Hours of Operation:  Two or more nonresidential uses
which do have overlapping peak hours of operation may jointly provide and use
parking spaces, with a reduction of their combined required number of spaces by
25%.  This is to encourage sharing of facilities, thus reducing the amount of
land devoted to parking facilities.  A written agreement between the joint
nonresident users shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator prior to the
commencement of any construction on the project.
(Ord. 01-2018.  Passed 1-18-18.)
1270.09  NUMBER OF PERMITTED DRIVEWAYS.
   (a)   The number of non-residential driveways permitted per principal
structure shall be the minimum necessary, as determined by the Planning
Commission, to provide reasonable access for regular traffic and emergency
vehicles, while preserving traffic operations and safety along the public
roadway.  Such determinations shall be based on the street frontage of the
parcel and the following:
      (1)   Where an existing site includes driveways that are not in
conformance with these access management standards, the Planning Commission may
require the closing 1 or more nonconforming driveways as part of any applicable
development approval as set forth in Section
1270.02.
      (2)   Where feasible, new vehicular access to a site shall be provided by
a shared driveway, cross access drive or internal service road.
      (3)   Additional driveways may be permitted where determined by the
Planning Commission to adequately accommodate traffic or ensure public safety.
   (b)   The Planning Commission may, as part of the site plan or subdivision
review process, require that existing driveways be moved, combined, re-aligned,
or eliminated to reduce the potential for accidents.
   (c)   Conditional Approval of Driveways and Curb Cuts.  As part of the site
plan or subdivision review process, the Planning Commission may approve a plan
with a specific driveway or curb cut location with the condition that an
agreement be first entered into between the property owner and the city,
requiring that if an internal service road is constructed in the future, or if
the opportunity for a shared driveway should present itself with development of
adjacent property, 1 or more approved driveways or curb cuts shall be closed
and measurements taken to utilize such service road or shared drive.  Approval
of driveways or curb cuts may also include restrictions on turning movements,
locations, or other requirements to ensure safe and efficient traffic movement.
(Ord. 01-2018.  Passed 1-18-18.) 
1270.10  DEVIATIONS FROM ACCESS SPACING REQUIREMENTS.
   Deviation from access spacing standards may be permitted as follows:
   (a)   Minor Deviation Request.  Minor deviations of 10% or less of the
allowable connection spacing standard may be authorized by the Planning
Commission where a property is otherwise unable to meet the minimum connection
spacing standards and where this deviation would not create a safety problem on
the public roadway.  The Planning Commission may consider the request and may
approve, approve with conditions, or deny the minor deviation request. 
   (b)   Major Deviation Request.  Requests for major deviations of greater
than 10% shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission
shall request a review and technical recommendation from the City Engineer
relative to the deviation request to assist in the evaluation on the merits of
the request.  The Planning Commission shall consider the request and may
approve, approve with conditions, or deny the major deviation request based on
a showing of the standard of review in Section
1270.10(B)(2) herein.
      (1)   Application Requirements.  Applicants requesting a major deviation
from these access spacing standards must submit an access management plan to
the Planning Commission for consideration and a traffic impact study shall be
required at the expense of the applicant to assist in these determinations.  At
a minimum, the access management plan must:
         A.   Encompass a study area defined by the length of the site's
frontage plus the distance of the applicable connection spacing standard,
measured from the property lines.
         B.   Include a review of both existing and future access for all
properties within the study area.
         C.   Include a justification for the requested deviation.  The
justification must address how the proposed plan advances the principles of
access management consistent with the stated goals and intent of these access
management regulations and, where a major deviation is being sought, the
justification must clarify why development of a unified or shared access and
circulation system is impractical.
      (2)   Access Spacing Modification Requirements.  After a review of the
applicant's request for a Major Deviation Request, the Planning Commission may
modify access spacing requirement if all of the following conditions have been
met:
         A.   A shared use driveway will be constructed to serve 2 or more
abutting building sites;
         B.   The building site is designed to provide cross access and unified
circulation with abutting sites with cross access easements provided in
accordance with Section
1270.04; and
         C.   The property owner executes an agreement to close any pre-
existing curb-cuts that do not meet the requirements of these access management
regulations after the construction of both sides of the shared use driveway,
and agrees to enter into a joint maintenance agreement defining maintenance
responsibilities of property owners that share the joint use driveway and cross
access system.
(Ord. 01-2018.  Passed 1-18-18.)
1270.11  TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Intent and Purpose.  A Traffic Impact Study (TIS) is a document that
analyzes the impact of a specific development to the area roadway system,
identifies any improvements necessary to maintain a satisfactory level of
service, and addresses potential safety concerns.  The Traffic Impact Study
will also help to determine the appropriate location, spacing, and design of
the access system for the proposed development to ensure compliance with the
access management regulations set forth in this Zoning Code as well as evaluate
the internal circulation and connectivity systems of the proposed development
to provide safe and efficient internal traffic flow and access to/from the
adjacent and nearby roadway system.
   (b)   Traffic Impact Study Applicability.  A Traffic Impact Study will be
required when any of the below conditions are met:
      (1)   A proposed development generating 100 or more trip ends (entering
plus exiting traffic) in the highest peak hour.
      (2)   A change in the use of an existing parcel whereas the new use will
generate 100 more trip ends in the highest peak hour.
      (3)   At the discretion of the City Engineer, uses generating less than
100 trips in the hour but whose access location or generated volumes could
still have a detrimental impact to the operation of the adjacent roadway.
      (4)   Where the proposed development is near a location that has
experienced a high number of vehicular accidents.
   (c)   These trip ends shall be calculated using the latest edition of the
Trip Generation Manual as published by the Institute of Transportation
Engineers.
   (d)   The City Engineer may require the applicant to provide counts from a
similar development in the absence of available information from the ITE Trip
Generation Manual.  Any data other than that derived from the ITE Trip
Generation Manual must be approved by the City Engineer prior to its use in any
Traffic Impact Study.
   (e)   Traffic Impact Study Contents.  Prior to commencing the preparation of
a Traffic Impact Study, the preparer shall contact the City Engineer to
determine the scope of the study.  Traffic impact studies shall include
analysis of the typical weekday morning and afternoon peak hours, unless
otherwise modified by the City Engineer.  The City Engineer may require other
hours of analysis based on the characteristics of the proposed development. 
The Traffic Impact Study shall include the following contents:
      (1)   Title Page.
      (2)   Development name and location.
      (3)   Name of applicant.
      (4)   Name and contact information of preparer.
      (5)   Date.
      (6)   Purpose and study objectives.
      (7)   Description of proposed development.
      (8)   Summary of Area Conditions.

health or water pollution abatement restrictions so long as such requirements
are consistent with, or more stringent than the stated purpose of this Zoning
Code.
   (b)   Administration.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the Zoning
Administrator or his or her designee shall administer, implement, and enforce
the provisions of this section.
   (c)   Notice of Violation.
      (1)   Any person found in violation of any provisions of this section or
any order, requirement, rule or regulation issued under the authority of this
section will be served with a written notice stating the nature of the
violation and providing reasonable time for compliance; provided however,
written notice of violation may be dispensed with under the conditions
described in division (i)(2) of this section, and provided further, that if the
Zoning Administrator has previously promulgated a schedule of compliance or
issued an order addressing the same type of or a similar violation and the time
for compliance has passed, the Zoning Administrator may dispense with
establishing another time period for compliance.
      (2)   The notice shall be served in the manner provided by law for the
service of civil process. Where the address of the violator is unknown, service
may be made upon the owner of the property involved at the tax-mailing address
of the owner as shown on the County tax record.
   (d)   Inspections.  Subject to applicable provisions of law, the Zoning

1404.04  UNSAFE BUILDINGS.
   (a)   Declaration of Unsafe Buildings or Structures.  All buildings or
structures, for the purpose of this section, are declared to be unsafe
buildings or structures:
      (1)   Insecure, unsafe or structurally defective;
      (2)   Not provided with adequate exits;
      (3)   Dangerous to human life; or
      (4)   Creating a hazard to safety or health by reason of inadequate
maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, collapse, partial collapse or
abandonment.
   (b)   Declaration of Nuisance.  All such unsafe buildings and structures are
hereby declared to be public nuisances, which shall be abated by repair,
rehabilitation, removal and/or demolition.
   (c)   Notice to Owner.
      (1)   The City Manager or designee (hereinafter “Inspector”) shall
examine or cause to be examined every building or structure or portion thereof
reported as dangerous or damaged, and if found to be an unsafe building or
structure as defined in division (a) hereof, shall give to the owner of such
building or structure and holders of equitable and/or legal lien(s)
(hereinafter “lien holders”) of record written notice stating the defects
thereof. This notice shall require the owner, within 30 days, to apply for and
receive the proper building authorizations and zoning certificates from the
City for the defects thereof, if applicable, and then commence either the
required repairs, improvements or demolition and removal of the building or
structure or portions thereof. This notice shall also state the City's
intention with respect to removal, demolition, repair, and/or any other action
relative to the unsafe building(s) or structure(s).  If necessary, such notice
shall also require the building, structure or portion thereof to be vacated
forthwith and not reoccupied until the required repairs, removal, demolition
and/or improvements are completed, inspected and approved by the Inspector.
      (2)   Service of such notice shall be by certified mail upon the owner(s)
and lien holder(s) of record. The 30-day period within which such owner is
required to comply with the order of the Inspector shall begin on the earliest
of the following events: receipt of notice, constructive notice, or three days
following notice being sent via certified mail.
      (3)   Emergency work:
         A.   In case there shall be actual and immediate danger of failure,
fire or collapse of a building or structure or any part thereof so as to
endanger life or property, the Inspector shall cause the necessary work to be
done to render the building or structure or part thereof temporarily safe. If
the building or structure is in a state of decay such that it is impracticable
to be repaired or made temporarily safe, the Inspector may order the building
or structure razed or demolished. Action may be taken whether the procedure
elsewhere in this chapter has been instituted or not.
         B.   For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section,
the Inspector may employ such supervisors, workmen, equipment, materials or
contractors as may be necessary.
   (d)   Equitable Remedy.  Upon the failure of an owner to comply with a
notice issued pursuant to division (c) hereof, the Inspector shall notify
Council of such failure and thereupon Council may order the repair,
improvement, demolition or removal of the building or structure, or portions
thereof. The cost of the repair, improvement, demolition or removal shall be
borne by the owner(s). Upon his or her failure to pay such cost upon completion
of the work, the cost shall be certified to the County Auditor for collection
as other taxes and shall be a lien upon the premises of the owner thereof. Such
improvement may, at the discretion of Council, be done by the City or by
advertising for contracts as otherwise provided by law.
   (e)   Unsafe Buildings to be Removed or Repaired.  No insurance company(ies)
doing business in the State of Ohio shall pay a claim of (a) named insured(s)
or lienholder(s) for fire damage to a building or other structure located
within the City where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the building
or other structure under all insurance policies exceeds five thousand dollars
($5,000.00) and the loss equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of
liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure unless there
is compliance with the following procedures:
      (1)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured(s) or lienholder
(s) and the insurance company(ies) equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure,
the insurance company(ies) in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26(F), shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Treasurer in the aggregate of two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for each fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00),
and each fraction of that amount, of a claim, or if at the time of a proof of
loss agreed to between the named insured(s) or lienholder(s) and the insurance
company(ies) the named insured(s) or lienholder(s) have submitted a
contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing, or securing
the building or other structure, shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the
amount specified in the estimate.
      Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies
insuring the building or structure. Policy proceeds remaining after the
transfer to the City may be disbursed in accord with the policy terms.
      The named insured(s) or lienholder(s) may submit a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing, or securing the building or other
structure after the transfer, and the Treasurer shall return the amount of the
funds in excess of the estimate to the named insured(s) or lienholder(s),
provided that the City has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the
building or other structure.
      (2)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the City as authorized by this section,
the Treasurer shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as
security against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing the building
or structure incurred by the City, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261 and the
provisions of this chapter.
      When transferring the funds as required in this division (d), the
insurance company(ies) shall provide the City with the name and address of the
named insured(s) or lienholder(s), whereupon the City shall contact the named
insured(s) or lienholder(s), certify that the proceeds have been received by
the City and notify them that the following procedure will be followed: The
funds shall be returned by the Treasurer to the named insured(s) or lienholder
(s) when repairs, or removal or securing of the building or other structure
have been completed and the required proof has been received by the Director of
Public Services, provided that the City has not incurred any costs for repairs,
removal or securing. However, the funds shall be returned to the named insured
(s) or lienholder(s) no later than 60 days after the Public Services Director
receives the required proof. If the City has incurred any costs for repairs,
removal or securing of the building or other structure, such costs shall be
paid from the fund, and if excess funds remain, the City shall transfer, no
later than 60 days after all such costs have been paid, the remaining funds to
the named insured(s) or lienholder(s) after repair, rebuilding, or removal has
been completed. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability
of the City to recover any deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261.
      Nothing in Ohio R.C. 3929.86(C), as adopted by this division (d), shall
be construed to prohibit the City and the named insured(s) or lienholder(s)
from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named
insured(s) or lienholder(s) if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged
property has been negotiated.

family dwelling or equivalent residential unit, such as condominiums, duplexes
and apartments, with the fee to be multiplied by the number of units. The
impact fee shall be due and payable at the time of application for a building
permit for the construction of any residential unit and as a condition of
approval.
   (b)   Funds derived from the impact fees shall be deposited to the Parks and
Recreation Fund.

budgetary process to determine if the fee meets the additional needs created by
the residential units and for the purpose of determining whether such fee
should be increased or decreased to meet current and anticipated needs.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
1430.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of
Trenton, State of Ohio, does ordain the following regulations.
(Ord. 14-2010.  Passed 10-7-10.)
1430.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 14-2010.  Passed 10-7-10.)
1430.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 14-2010.  Passed 10-7-10.)
1430.04  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 14-2010.  Passed 10-7-10.)
1430.05  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City as identified in Section
1430.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City.

1430.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 14-2010.  Passed 10-7-10.)
1430.10  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the

validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 14-2010.  Passed 10-7-10.)
1430.11  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory structure” means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.  The base flood may also be referred to
as the one percent chance annual flood or 100-year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-year) flood elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from one to three feet).
   (e)   “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure below the lowest floor.”  See “Lowest floor.”
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management),” issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no Federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” is the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “Flooding” means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM),” usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   “Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)” is an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood insurance risk zones” are zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood insurance study (FIS)” is the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood protection elevation (FPE)” is the base flood elevation plus
one foot of freeboard.  In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway” is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized
by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” is an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of map change (LOMC)” is an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary
and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies.  LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   “Letter of map amendment (LOMA)” is a revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area.  A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate
map and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood
hazard area.
      (2)   “Letter of map revision (LOMR)” is a revision based on technical
data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   “Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR)” is a formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria.  A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a recreational vehicle.  For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park,” as specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue
purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure
used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land
that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are
for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the
lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured
homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)” is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction” means structures for which the “start of
construction” commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of
Trenton Flood Insurance Rate Map, December 25, 1981, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   “Person” includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, State college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or State community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (cc)   “Registered professional architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C.
4703.01 to 4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered professional engineer” means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered professional surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special flood hazard area,” also known as “areas of special flood
hazard,” it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood
insurance studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary
maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99.  Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction” is the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation.  Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial damage” is damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.  Substantial damage also means flood-related damage
sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for
which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average,
equals or exceeds twenty-five percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement.  This term includes structures, which have
incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction;”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of an “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   (kk)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.

1430.40  DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, State, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and/or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections
1430.70 through
1430.75.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 14-2010.  Passed 10-7-10.)
1430.41  SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in Floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1430.39(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Mayor and the chief executive officer of any
other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (b)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Paragraph (a)(2), items A. and C. through E. hereof.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1430.39(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file,
within ten days of the date of such notice and order, or other official action,
a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any
item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such
appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 14-2010.  Passed 10-7-10.)
1430.73  VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City.
   (b)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (c)   Variances Shall Only be Issued Upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property. 
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in paragraph (b)(1) to (11) hereof
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 14-2010.  Passed 10-7-10.)
1430.74  PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.

1482.01  APPLICATION OF CODE.
   The provisions of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code shall apply to all
premises and structures within the City of Trenton used for human habitation,
commercial purposes or industrial purposes which are now or may become in the
future substandard with respect to structure, maintenance, proper drainage and
sanitary conditions, or other similar conditions which otherwise constitute a
public nuisance. The existence of such conditions, factors or characteristics
adversely affects public health, safety, morals and general welfare and leads
to the continuation, extension and aggravation of blight and its attendant
negative effect on surrounding property values. Therefore, adequate protection
of the public requires the establishment and enforcement of these property
maintenance standards.
(Ord. 1-95. Passed 1-5-95.)
1482.02  COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   Every portion of a building or premises used or intended to be used for
residential, commercial or industrial purposes shall comply with the provisions
of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code, irrespective of when such building
has been constructed, altered or repaired, or when such premises were occupied,
except as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 1-95. Passed 1-5-95.)
1482.03  CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   In any case where a provision of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code is
found to be in conflict with a provision of any zoning, building, fire, safety,
health or other regulation, the provision which establishes the higher standard
for the promotion and protection of the safety and health of the people shall
prevail.
(Ord. 1-95. Passed 1-5-95.)
1482.04  EXISTING REMEDIES.
   Nothing in this Exterior Property Maintenance Code shall be deemed to
abolish, impair or prevent the execution of any existing remedies of the City
of Trenton or its officers or agents relating to the abatement of a public
nuisance.
(Ord. 1-95. Passed 1-5-95.)
1482.05  SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this
Exterior Property Maintenance Code is declared invalid for any reason
whatsoever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this
Exterior Property Maintenance Code, which shall continue in full force and
effect, and to this end the provisions of this Exterior Property Maintenance
Code are hereby declared to be separable.
(Ord. 1-95. Passed 1-5-95.)
1482.06  SAVING CLAUSE.
   This Exterior Property Maintenance Code shall not affect violations of any
other resolution, ordinance, code or regulation existing prior to the effective
date of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code, and any violation of such
shall be governed and shall continue to be punishable to the full extent of the
law under the provisions of those resolutions, ordinances, codes or regulations
in effect at the time the violation was committed.
(Ord. 1-95. Passed 1-5-95.)

be personally liable for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a
result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his or her duties

1482.08  INSPECTIONS.
   The Enforcement Officer is hereby authorized to make inspections of building
exteriors and premises located within the City of Trenton for purposes of
enforcing the provisions of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code. For the
purpose of making such inspections, and upon showing appropriate
identification, the Enforcement Officer is hereby authorized to examine and
survey at any reasonable hour all residential, commercial, industrial and other
premises.
(Ord. 1-95. Passed 1-5-95.)

no more than thirty days from the date the petition was filed. At such hearing,
the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to be heard and to show cause why
any item appearing on such notice and order should be modified or withdrawn.

of violation, the property was being maintained in violation of specific
provisions of the City of Trenton Exterior Property Maintenance Code and/or
conditions imposed by the Appeals Board as a prerequisite to the modification
of a previous compliance order.

1482.11  PROSECUTION.
   In case any violation order is not promptly complied with, the Enforcement
Officer may request the City Attorney to institute an appropriate action or
proceeding at law to exact the penalty provided in Section

or in equity against the person responsible for the violation for the purpose
of ordering him or her to abate such nuisance.
(Ord. 1-95. Passed 1-5-95.)

   Should the nuisance not be abated at the expiration of the time stated in
the notice or order of the Enforcement Officer, or at the expiration of any
extension granted, or at the expiration of such additional time as the Exterior
Property Code Appeals Board may grant, the Enforcement Officer shall be
authorized at any time thereafter to request a court to authorize entry to take
such action as deemed appropriate to abate the nuisance, in addition to any
remedies provided elsewhere in this Exterior Property Maintenance Code. In
abating such nuisance, the Enforcement Officer may call on any department,
division or contractor of the City for whatever assistance may be necessary to

and the cost of the contract will be paid for from City funds. All costs for
abating such nuisance shall be recovered in the following manner:

interest of public safety, health and welfare, to adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations to implement the provisions of this Code, to secure the intent
thereof and to designate requirements applicable because of local climatic or
other conditions, but such rules shall not have the effect of waiving working
stresses or fire protection requirements specifically provided in this Code or
violating approved practice involving public safety.

farming shall be generally exempt from the requirements set forth in (a) and
(b) above.  However, grass and weeds within thirty feet of any street right-of-
way line shall be maintained at a height not to exceed twenty-four inches,
except grass and weeds located between a curb and sidewalk shall be maintained
at a height not to exceed eight inches.  Further, trees, plants and weeds which
have been identified as noxious or invasive located within thirty feet of the
property line of any developed lot or parcel shall be eradicated within thirty
days after their discovery and identification.
      (4)   Platted but undeveloped lots.  Each owner of an undeveloped lot
within a platted subdivision shall maintain grass and weeds at a height not to
exceed twelve inches, except grass and weeds located between a curb and
sidewalk shall be maintained at a height not to exceed eight inches.  Further,
trees, plants and weeds which have been identified as noxious or invasive
located within thirty feet of the property line of any developed lot or parcel
shall be eradicated within thirty days after their discovery and
identification. For the purpose of the preceding subsections (3) and (4),
"developed lot or parcel" means any land on which there is a building designed
for or suitable for residential use.
   (d)  Obstructions to lawful maintenance.  Regardless of its use, no parcel
or platted lot shall be altered so as to increase the accumulation of surface
water or to divert any accumulation of water onto adjacent properties except in
conformance with a drainage plan approved by the City.  Further, no owner of
any parcel or platted lot shall permit any soil, rocks, refuse or construction
debris to be deposited or remain which obstructs its being maintained in
conformance with the requirements of this section, except during the period of
active construction.  A lot or parcel shall be considered "actively under
construction" only during that period commencing with the issuance of the City
building permit for the principal structure and concluding with the issuance of
the City occupancy permit for that structure. 
(Ord. 13-2012.  Passed 6-21-12.)
1490.04  ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES
   (a)   No person described in Section
1490.01 shall be charged with a violation of this Section without first being
actually or constructively notified in writing of such violation by the City
Manager or his designee.
   (b)   Upon becoming aware of an alleged violation, the City Manager or his
designee shall cause written notice thereof (hereinafter "the notice") to be
served upon the property owner(s) of record at their county-listed real estate
tax mailing address by first class mail.  This mailing shall be evidenced by a
certificate of mailing issued by the U.S. Postal Service and shall be deemed
"constructively received" by the owner or owners on the third day after
mailing, not including the date of mailing. 
      (1)   Alternatively, the City Manager or his designee shall cause the
notice to be served upon the owner(s) by personal service.  Such "actual
receipt" shall be evidenced by a "return of service" signed by the server.   
      (2)   The notice shall be dated, generally describe the alleged violation
(s) (hereinafter "the nuisances"), identify the regulation or regulations
invoked, and require the owner to correct the violations within seven days. 
The notice shall offer the opportunity to appeal the allegations in the notice
to the City Manager.  It shall also provide information to assist the recipient
in filing his appeal with the City Manager. 
   (c)   Upon actual or constructive receipt of the notice, whichever first
occurs, the owner shall cause the identified nuisances to be corrected within
seven days thereafter.  However, any owner or owner's authorized agent may,
within this seven day compliance period, appeal the alleged violation to the
City Manager on the basis that one or more of the alleged nuisances do not
exist.  Failure to appeal to the City Manager shall constitute a failure to
exhaust administrative remedies and shall preclude any appeal to the courts.
   (d)   An appeal filed with the City Manager during the seven day appeal
period described in (c) above shall stay all proceedings until the City Manager
confirms or overrules the nuisance allegations.  Following such an appeal, the
City Manager or his designee shall cause written notice of his decision
(hereinafter "the decision") to be served upon the property owner(s) of record
at their county-listed real estate tax mailing address by first class mail. 
This mailing shall be evidenced by a certificate of mailing issued by the U.S.
Postal Service and shall be deemed "constructively received" by the owner or
owners on the third day after mailing, not including the date of mailing. 
      (1)   Alternatively, the City Manager or his designee shall cause the
decision to be served upon the owner(s) by personal service.  Such "actual
receipt" shall be evidenced by a "return of service" signed by the server.   
      (2)   In the event that any nuisance is found by the City Manager, the
owner shall cure the nuisance within seven days after actual or constructive
receipt of the City Manager's decision.
(Ord. 13-2012.  Passed 6-21-12.)
1490.05  MUNICIPAL  INTERVENTION AND COLLECTION OF COSTS
   (a)   In the event that all the remaining identified nuisances have not been
cured within seven days following mailing of the notice, and the owner has not
filed an appeal with the City Manager, the City may at any time thereafter
enter onto the property and cure all remaining previously-identified
nuisances. 
   (b)   In the event that the owner has appealed the notice to the City
Manager, and after the City Manager finds that one or more of the cited
nuisances continue to exist after the extended compliance period, the City may,
at its option, within seven days after the violator's actual or constructive
receipt of the City Manager's decision, enter upon the property and cure all
nuisances cited in the original notice which remain.
   (c)   In the event that the City elects to enter onto the property to cure
nuisances as authorized in subsection (a) or (b) above, the City may, at its
option, and without further notice to the owner, lessee, agent, tenant,
occupant or other person having possession or charge of such property, continue
to enter upon the property from time to time in order to maintain control of
the identified nuisances, so long as the property remains titled in the name of
the originally-notified owner in the official records of the Auditor of Butler
County, Ohio. This right shall continue for the entire calendar year.
   (d)   The City shall not be responsible for any damage done to the premises
under the authorization provided in subsections (a), (b) and (c) above and
shall have the right to invoice the owner for all such work performed at the
liquidated cost of $120.00 per on-site man-hour, including all equipment,
equipment maintenance, supplies, and overhead costs, with a minimum charge of
$300.00. 
   (e)   If the owner does not pay for the work performed by the City pursuant
to the above subsections (a), (b) or (c) within thirty days following the
mailing of each invoice, the City may without further notice recover the
amounts authorized by the above subsection (d) using the collection procedures
set forth in Ohio R.C. 715.261 or any other legal means of collection.

property.  A certificate of service dated and signed by the City employee who
mailed and posted such notice shall be attached to and placed in the
appropriate City file with each notice; and
   (b)   Any subsequent violation within the same 365 day period shall be
reviewed by the City Manager to determine if the property is a chronic nuisance
property.
(Ord. 09-2017.  Passed 6-1-17.)

Trenton under subsection (b) hereof, stipulating that the amount must be paid
in full to the City's Department of Finance within thirty days after the date
of the violation notice;
      (7)   A prominent notice that failure to pay the civil penalty within
thirty days of the date of the violation notice will result in the penalty
amount, with statutory interest, to be certified to Butler County Auditor's
Office for collection with the real estate taxes;
      (8)   The date by which the owner is required to abate the violation to
prevent another civil penalty from being assessed as provided by Section
1802.06, Abatement; and
      (9)   A prominent notice that subsequent violations of the same City Code
on the same property may result in additional civil penalties as provided by
subsection (b) hereof.

to any other fines or penalties allowed by law for the same offence.
      (1)   First violation of this chapter - fifty dollars ($50.00).

dollars ($250.00) within 365 days after the second violation of this chapter.
      (4)   Fourth violation and all subsequent violations of this chapter -
additional five hundred dollars ($500.00).
      (5)   After one year without a repeat violation of this chapter, the
property shall no longer be designated a chronic nuisance property, but instead
shall be treated as if it had not been previously designated as such.
(Ord. 09-2017.  Passed 6-1-2017.)
1802.05  DUE PROCESS AND DEFENSES.
   (a)   Civil penalties shall be assessed against the person or persons listed

may appeal the violation notice to the City Manager who shall offer a hearing
to such owner(s).
   (c)   If at such hearing, the owner(s) provide reliable documentation that
such owner(s) did not own the property at the time of one or more of the
violations supporting the violation notice, the City Manager shall waive any
civil penalty(s) imposed by this chapter and have the City's property file
corrected to reflect his determination of the facts.
   (d)   If at such hearing, the owner(s) provide reliable documentation that
they are actively and lawfully evicting the tenants who committed the nuisance
activity in question, the City Manager may agree to delay further enforcement,
delay with conditions, or decline to delay.  Any delay shall be for a specified
period not to exceed ninety days after such decision, unless subsequently

following:
      (1)   Immediate. When the violation poses an immediate and significant
threat to human life, health, safety or the natural environment. This notice

made within a sufficient time to eliminate the threat, the City may, at its
discretion, abate the violation to the best of its ability.

or appropriate time requirements may be mandated for the owner(s) of the
property to abate the notified nuisance.

be invoiced to the property owner(s).  Payment shall be due thirty days after
the issuance of the invoice. The owner(s) shall be jointly and severally liable
for payment.
   (c)   Abatement of the nuisance by the City does not affect civil penalties
previously imposed or any other applicable fines or legal rights of the City.

1802.07  OTHER REMEDIES.

which has an unabated violation, unpaid fines or unpaid civil penalties shall
not qualify for occupancy permits or zoning certificates until all violations

penalties, suspension or revocation of permits, an order to abate a nuisance,

affect or limit the City's right or authority to bring a criminal prosecution
or other legal action against the property owner for these violations or any
other City ordinances or for civil damages; or under the Ohio Revised Code,
including but not limited to, those actions and remedies provided by Ohio R.C.
