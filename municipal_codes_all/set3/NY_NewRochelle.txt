This policy is consistent with the State Technology Law, Section 208 as
added by Chapters 442 and 491 of the laws of 2005. This policy requires

the notification impedes a criminal investigation. In such case, notification
will be delayed only as long as needed to determine that notification no
longer compromises any investigation.

The City will notify the affected individual. Such notice shall be directly
provided to the affected persons by one of the following methods:

shall be deemed to have been amended automatically at that time,
without the need for redrafting, in order to reflect and be consistent
with DOT's regulations. In such case, the City reserves the right to
apply the amended requirements immediately, and without giving prior
notice to drivers and/or applicants, unless such notice is required by

Each Construction Contractor shall take the following steps in
the following order, in an effort to employ Targeted Workers
to perform at least 20% of the work hours on the project or
contract.
(a)
(1)
A.
§ 31-3 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 31-4
30:88
Step One: utilize the Construction Contractor's discretion
to assign to perform project work to any current
employees who are Targeted Workers;
[1]
Step Two: If the Construction Contractor utilizes a union
hiring hall to retain workers, utilize name call, rehire,
similar procedures in the relevant collective bargaining
agreement, and an explicit request, to retain Targeted
Workers;
[2]
Step Three: If the above steps have not enabled
employment of Targeted Workers to perform at least 20%
of the work hours on the project or contract, request
referral of Targeted Workers from the First Source Center;
and
[3]
Step Four: Reasonably consider workers that have been
referred by the First Source Center within five business
days of request therefor.
[4]
If the Construction Contractor has not filled available jobs
with Targeted Workers through the steps set forth above, it
may recruit and hire workers through any mechanism, and
shall continue to reasonably consider workers that have been
referred by the First Source Center for up to 15 days after
initial notification. Employers that need to hire on an
emergency basis in order to maintain operations may hire from
any source immediately, but still shall notify the First Source
Center about available positions, and reasonably consider any
candidates referred before hiring is complete.
(b)
New apprentice employment requirements for Prime Contractors.
For each 20,000 construction work hours performed by a Prime
Contractor and its subcontractors of any tier, such Prime
Contractor and/its subcontractors of any tier shall act as a
Subscribing Employer for at least one individual newly enrolled
as an apprentice in an apprenticeship program registered with

Nonconstruction employment. Each Employer shall undertake the
following steps in the following order, in an effort to hire Targeted
Workers to fill at least 25% of available jobs on the project or contract.
Step One: Notification of job opportunities. When an Employer
has an opening for an on-site job available, the Employer shall
notify the First Source Center of the job opening and provide
a description of job responsibilities and qualifications. Job
qualifications shall be limited to qualifications directly related to
performance of job duties.
(1)
B.
§ 31-4 DRUG TESTING § 31-4
30:89
§ 31-5. Business opportunities.
Step Two: Consideration of Targeted Workers. The Employer shall
then use standard hiring practices, including interviews, to
consider all Targeted Workers referred by the First Source Center
and meeting the qualifications described in the referral request
during a five-day period after initial notification, or until all open
on-site jobs are filled, whichever is sooner. The Employer shall
make good-faith efforts to fill all available on-site jobs with
Targeted Workers. If at the conclusion of the five-day period the
Employer has been unable to fill all openings for on-site jobs with
Targeted Workers, the Employer may use other recruitment
methods. Employers that need to hire on an emergency basis in
order to maintain operations may hire from any source
immediately, but still shall notify the First Source Center about
available positions, and reasonably consider any candidates
referred before hiring is complete.
(2)
Hiring discretion. Nothing in this policy requires that any Construction
Contractor or Employer hire any particular individual; each
Construction Contractor shall have the sole discretion to judge the
qualification of and to hire or decline to hire any individual referred by
the First Source Center or any other source. In order to improve the
first source system and the City's job training pipeline, each Employer
that declines to hire all first source referrals for an available position
shall provide to the First Source Center a written account of reasons
for rejecting such candidates.
C.
First Source Center.
Role and responsibilities. The City shall designate a First Source
Center, which shall refer qualified and/or trained workers to
employers pursuant to this policy. The First Source Center shall

the integrity of the City of New Rochelle government. To that extent,
the following City officers and elected officials shall file with the Board
of Ethics of the City of New Rochelle annually, on or before February
28 of every year following the enactment of this article during the term
of their office, a statement of their financial holdings, assets, liabilities
and net worth. The time for filing such statement may be extended,
pursuant to the rules of the Board of Ethics, for justifiable cause and
for undue hardship upon application to the Board of Ethics pursuant to
the rules and regulations set forth in this article and, if applicable, to

statement, due to justifiable cause or undue hardship. Such rules
and regulations shall provide for a date beyond which in all cases
of justifiable cause or undue hardship no further extension of time
will be granted. The Board of Ethics may utilize or modify such

Permit any person required to file a financial disclosure statement
to request an exemption from any requirement to report one or
more items of information which pertain to such person's spouse

individual's spouse, on his or her own behalf or on behalf of an

bearing on the discharge of the reporting person's official duties.

shall provide for exemptions to be granted either on the application
of the individual or on behalf of persons who share the same job
title or employment classification which the Board of Ethics deems
to be comparable for purposes of this section. Such rules and
regulations may permit the granting of an exemption where, in
the discretion of the Board of Ethics, the public interest does not
require disclosure and the applicant's duties do not involve the

filed with the Board of Ethics to ascertain whether any person subject
to the reporting requirements of this article, a Code of Ethics, local law,

§ 33-14. Penalties for offenses.
A reporting individual who knowingly and willfully fails after notice to file
an annual statement of financial disclosure or who knowingly and willfully

filed pursuant to this article shall be assessed a civil penalty in an amount
not to exceed $10,000. Assessment of a civil penalty hereunder shall be
made by the Board of Ethics with respect to the persons subject to its
jurisdiction. For a violation of this article other than for conduct which
constitutes a violation of Subdivision 12 of § 73 of the Public Officers Law,
the Board of Ethics may, in lieu of a civil penalty, refer a violation to the
appropriate prosecutor and, upon conviction after such a referral, violation
shall be punishable as a Class A misdemeanor. A civil penalty for false filing
may not be imposed hereunder in the event that a category of value or
amount reported hereunder is incorrect unless such reported information is
falsely understated. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to
the contrary, no other penalty, civil or criminal, may be imposed for a failure
to file or for a false filing of such statement, except that the City Council
of the City of New Rochelle may impose disciplinary action as otherwise
provided by law. The Board of Ethics shall be deemed to be an agency within
the meaning of Article 3 of the State Administrative Procedure Act and
shall adopt rules governing the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings and
appeals relating to the assessment of civil penalties herein authorized. Such
rules, which shall not be subject to the approval requirements of the State
Administrative Procedure Act, shall provide for due process procedural
local law, ordinance or resolution or the Board of Ethics receives a
sworn complaint alleging such a violation or if the Board of Ethics
determines on its own initiative to investigate a possible violation, the
Board of Ethics shall notify the reporting person in writing, describe the
possible or alleged violation of such Code of Ethics, local law, ordinance
or resolution or this article and provide the person with a fifteen-day
period in which to submit a written response setting forth information
relating to the activities cited as a possible or alleged violation of law.
If the Board of Ethics thereafter makes a determination that further
inquiry is justified, it shall give the reporting person an opportunity to
be heard. The Board shall also inform the reporting individual of its
rules regarding the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings and appeals
and the due process procedural mechanisms available to such
individual. If the Board determines at any stage of the proceeding
that there is no violation or that any potential conflict of interest
violation has been rectified, it shall so advise the reporting person
and the complainant, if any. All of the foregoing proceedings shall be
confidential.
If the Board determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that a
violation has occurred, it shall send a notice of reasonable cause to the
reporting person, to the complainant, if any, and to the City Council of
the City of New Rochelle.

reporting individuals in a proceeding commenced against the Board of

of the Board of Ethics, the Board of Ethics shall render advisory opinions
on the requirements of said provisions. An opinion rendered by the Board
of Ethics, until and unless amended or revoked, shall be binding on the
Board of Ethics in any subsequent proceeding concerning the person who
requested the opinion and who acted in good faith, unless material facts
were omitted or misstated by the person in the request for an opinion. Such
opinion may also be relied upon by such person and may be introduced and
shall be a defense in any criminal or civil action. Such requests shall be
confidential, but the Board of Ethics may publish such opinions, provided
that the name of the requesting person and other identifying details shall
not be included in the publication.
§ 33-17. Additional powers and duties of Board of Ethics.

as shall be convenient to the department head. For the purpose of
having vacation schedules conform to departmental convenience,
vacation may be granted, in any year, in advance of its being fully
earned.

B.
§ 52-19 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 52-20
41:144
For the earning of annual leave credits, the time recorded on the
payroll at the full rate of pay shall be considered as time in service
by an employee. Properly approved absences with pay shall not
affect an employee's entitlement to accrue annual vacation leave
credits.
(3)
Up to one year's unused vacation allowance may be carried forward
from one year to the following year upon the recommendation
of the employee's department head and the approval of the City
Manager based upon a request in writing submitted by the
employee not later than October 1 of the calendar year for which
such leave accrued.
(4)
Vacation upon separation from service.
In any calendar year in which a nonrepresented employee resigns
or retires, he shall be entitled to take or to be paid for such pro
rata share of annual vacation leave for that same year as he earns
up to the date of resignation or retirement. However, any employee
who was originally appointed to the City's service prior to January
1, 1962, shall be entitled to his full annual vacation leave for the
year of his retirement regardless of the date of his retirement.
(1)
Upon resignation or retirement a nonrepresented employee may

time and in case of death in service the beneficiaries of such
deceased employees may receive the same.

resignation or retirement shall not exceed the total accumulated in
the year of resignation or retirement and the one year preceding
separation from service.

end of the vacation year for which carryover authorization has not

D.
§ 52-20 INSURANCE § 52-21
41:145
§ 52-21. Sick leave.
Sick leave allowance shall be 12 days a year computed at the rate of
one day per month for each month of work performed by the employee
diminished by any sick leave taken by any employee. The rate of sick
leave allowance accrual for part-time employees shall be prorated in
accordance with the actual work schedule of such part-time employees.
Employees hired on a per diem, temporary or seasonal basis shall not
be entitled to any sick leave allowance. The minimum charge against
sick leave shall be 1/2 working day. Any regular sick leave allowance
accrued at the end of any calendar year shall be carried over to the next
year, but not in excess of 200 days.
A.
Sick leave control and certification.
The granting of sick leave with pay shall lie within the discretion of
the employee's department head or, in case of a department head,
in the discretion of the City Manager.
(1)
Accumulated or unused sick leave shall not form the basis for
granting extra pay or for extension of vacation periods. Such sick
leave may be consumed only by absences from work caused by
sickness or disability.
(2)
Upon becoming ill or disabled, the employee or some person acting
in his behalf shall give prompt notice at the beginning of the first
day of absence to the employee's department head or, in the case
of a department head, to the City Manager.
(3)
Where employees are absent from work only infrequently and there
is no record of unusual or recurring use of sick leave privilege,
the department head may allow absences up to two consecutive
working days without a doctor's certificate. An absence of three
or more consecutive working days must be substantiated by a
certificate either from the City physician or the employee's private
physician attesting to the fact that the absence was necessitated
by a legitimate sickness or disability. An absence commencing
on the last working day of a week and continuing through the
first working day of the following week shall require a certificate
as described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a department
head who from the record feels that an employee is making
improper, excessive or recurrent use of accrued sick time shall
report such absence to the City physician who shall make such
investigation of the alleged illness or disability, as he deems proper.
The City physician shall promptly transmit to the employee's
department head his finding as to whether or not the sick leave
privilege is being abused. Employees whose absences require
certification shall not be entitled to sick leave with pay without
furnishing such certification either from the City physician or his
private physician.
(4)
B.
§ 52-21 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 52-21
41:146
§ 52-22. Paid holidays.
A record of frequent absences shall be cause for investigation of
each subsequent absence by the City physician at the request of the
department head. The City physician shall report to the department
head whether or not each such absence justifies the use of sick
leave. Employees whose absences are found to be not certifiable as
being caused by sickness or disability shall not be entitled to sick
leave with pay.
(5)
Sick leave extension. Where an employee, because of sickness or
disability, is required to remain away from his employment beyond the
maximum normal sick leave entitlement accrued to his credit, such
an employee may be granted additional sick leave extension at 1/2
pay up to but not in excess of 60 calendar days. Such sick leave
extension may be granted upon certification by the City physician
or the employee's private physician, specifying the additional time
required by such employee at the request of the employee or any
person on his behalf in writing. Such request for additional sick leave
extension, together with the doctor's certification, shall be filed with
the employee's department head and approved by the City Manager
before such extension is granted. Prior to the use of sick leave granted
by any extension, charge will be made against any vacation, personal
or other leave balances credited to the individual. In no event shall the
total sick leave with pay exceed 180 days in any one calendar year.
C.
The following regular holidays with pay shall apply to nonrepresented
permanent employees: [Amended 7-15-2008 by Ord. No. 144-2008]

employees shall be granted such other day of leave with pay as may be
convenient to the department head.
Any employee who is absent from duty because of occupational injury
or disease, as defined by the Worker's Compensation Law, may, pending
ajudication of his case, be granted leave with full pay, commencing
from the first day of disability, for a period not to exceed cumulatively
six months (130 working days) without charge against the employee's
accumulated sick, vacation or personal leave credits.
A.
Notice of occupational injury or disease should be given to the
employee's department head or, in case of a department head, to the
City Manager within 48 hours after the accident causing such injury or
illness, or within 48 hours after the employee should reasonably have
discovered such injury or illness.
B.
If approval for leave at full pay is not granted, the employee's absence
from work due to alleged occupational injury or illness shall be charged
against accrued sick leave, personal leave and vacation leave, in that
order. If the Worker's Compensation Board subsequently finds in favor
of the employee, then accrued sick leave, personal leave or vacation
leave credits used by the employee to cover the absence shall be
restored to him.
C.
Sick and vacation leave credits shall not be earned for periods that an
employee is on worker's compensation leave without pay.

be granted upon the approval of the department head or, in the case
of a department head, approval of the City Manager a leave of up
to four workdays with pay on account of each death of a member of
the employee's immediate family. The "immediate family" is defined as
follows: grandparent, brother, sister, spouse, child, father or mother of
the employee or of his spouse or any relative of the employee or his
spouse living in the same dwelling with the employee.
A.
In the event of critical or serious illness of a member of an employee's
immediate family, leave with pay up to four consecutive working days
may be granted upon certification by the employee's private physician
or the City physician that the employee's presence at the bedside
of the critically or seriously ill member of the immediate family was
absolutely essential to the treatment, care and possible recovery of the
ill person from a medical or therapeutic standpoint. Such certification
may be approved by the employee's department head or, in the case of
a department head, by the City Manager. Such period of leave with pay
may be extended to a maximum of 10 working days, provided that any

so affected. Employees granted jury leave shall pay the City all earnings
received for jury duty.

Section 104-b of the General Municipal Law requires the governing
body of every municipality to adopt a procurement policy for all goods
and services which are not required by law to be publicly bid.
A.
Every purchase to be made must be initially reviewed to determine
whether it is a purchase contract or a public works contract. Once that
determination is made, a good faith effort will be made to determine
whether it is known or can reasonably be expected that the aggregate
amount to be spent on the item of supply or service is not subject
to competitive bidding, taking into account past purchases and the
aggregate amount to be spent in a year. Such determination must be
documented. The following items are not subject to competitive bidding
pursuant to § 103 of the General Municipal Law:
Purchase contracts under $20,000 and public works contracts
under $35,000.
(1)
(2) Emergency purchases.
(3) Perishable items of food.
Goods purchased from agencies for the blind or severely
handicapped.
(4)
(5) Goods purchased from correctional institutions.
Purchases under state, county, or any political subdivision
contracts.
(6)
Surplus and secondhand purchases from another governmental
entity.
(7)
Purchases under certain Federal General Services contracts as
defined in GML §§ 103-1-b and 104-2.
(8)
Purchases under certain Cooperative or buying group contracts as
defined in GML § 103-16.

must include an explanation of how the award will achieve savings or how
the offeror was not responsible.
§ 62-4. Exceptions.
Pursuant to General Municipal Law § 104-b2f, the procurement policy may
anticipate circumstances when or types of procurements for which, in
the sole discretion of the governing body, the solicitation of alternative
proposals or quotations will not be in the best interest of the municipality.
The determination that such circumstances exist shall, in each case, only
be made by either the City Manager or by resolution of the City Council of
the City of New Rochelle. In the following circumstances it may not be in
the best interests of the City of New Rochelle to solicit quotations. Written
documentation of such determination and approval must be maintained for
each procurement:
§ 62-5. Standardization of purchase.
Standardization of a particular type of material or equipment must be
approved by a City Council resolution setting forth all of the reasons for a
need for standardization as defined in General Municipal Law § 103. The
adoption of a resolution by City Council requires a vote of at least 3/5
of all members of the City Council. Such resolution shall state reasons of
efficiency or economy.
§ 62-6. Professional services.
As defined in GML § 104-b, professional services are not subject to
competitive bidding. The City Manager or Commissioner of Finance may
Emergency purchases pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 4, of the General
Municipal Law. Due to the nature of this exception, these goods or
services must be purchased immediately, and a delay in order to seek
alternate proposals may threaten the life, health, safety or welfare of
the residents. This subsection does not preclude alternate proposals
if time permits. Emergency procurements require approval of the City
Manager through either the Department Head or City Manager, when
circumstances allow.
A.
Purchases of surplus and secondhand goods from any source. If
alternate proposals are required, the City is precluded from purchasing
surplus and secondhand goods at auctions or through specific
advertised sources where the best prices are usually obtained. It is also
difficult to try to compare prices of used goods, and a lower price may
indicate an older product. Therefore, as set forth in this § 62-6, such
purchases may be authorized.
B.
Sole Source procurement may be entered into without a competitive
process, based on written documentation that only one known source
exists or that there are no other reasonable alternative sources that can
fulfill the requirements and where competition is not feasible.
C.
§ 62-3 POLICE, AUXILIARY § 62-6
56:165
determine in the best interest of the City that the issuance of a formal
Request for Proposal for professional services is required in certain
circumstances.
§ 62-7. Authorized purchasers.
The City Manager, the Commissioner of Finance or the Purchasing Manager
are authorized to make purchases of goods and services on behalf of the
City. The names of the individuals holding these positions will be set forth
in the annual Omnibus legislation.

information and detailed statements have been filed complying with
all the pertinent requirements of this article and upon finding that
any excavation or construction of footings and foundations undertaken

all due diligence with the completion of the work for which any
excavation or construction of footings and foundations is made
pursuant to any temporary permit issued under the provisions of
this section.

be possible, which said bond shall be in a form satisfactory to and
approved by the Department of Law. The finding of the Building

judgment, good cause is shown and the public health, safety and
welfare of the City will not be jeopardized, extend such permit for
one further period not to exceed an additional six months.
(5)
Revocation of temporary permits. Any temporary permit issued

Building Official upon a finding that any of the conditions affixed
thereto have not been complied with or upon a finding that the

by the actions of the applicant subsequent to the issuance of such
permit or upon the failure of the applicant to proceed with due
diligence in the obtaining of further necessary approvals or permits
for the completion of the construction for which said temporary
permit was issued within six months from the date of issuance
or extension thereof. The failure of the applicant to whom the
temporary permit has been issued to obtain any and all necessary
approvals and permits for the further progress of the work for
which the temporary permit is issued within a period of six months
from the date of issuance thereof shall be deemed prima facie

the permit holder a certification of the as-built elevation of
the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, in relation to mean
sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by or under the
direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or professional
engineer and certified by same. For manufactured homes, the
permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation upon
placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of elevation
must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains
on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully
licensed and ready for highway use).
(a)
In Zones V1-V30 and VE, and also Zone V if base flood elevation
data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor of a new
or substantially improved structure, the permit holder shall
submit to the Local Administrator a certificate of elevation,
in relation to mean sea level, of the bottom of the lowest
structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and
columns). For manufactured homes, the permit holder shall
submit the certificate of elevation upon placement of the
structure on the site. An elevation certificate must also be
submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a site 180
consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed and ready
for highway use).
(b)
Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval
of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The
Local Administrator shall review all data submitted.
Deficiencies detected shall be cause to issue a stop work order
for the project unless immediately corrected.

to structures located in areas of special flood hazard shown as Zone
V1-V30, VE or V on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map
designated in § 111-32B:
Elevation. New construction and substantial improvements shall be
elevated on pilings, columns or shear walls such that the bottom
of the lowest horizontal structural member supporting the lowest
elevated floor (excluding columns, piles, diagonal bracing attached
to the piles or columns, grade beams, pile caps and other members
designed to either withstand storm action or break away without
imparting damaging loads to the structure) is elevated to or above
two feet above base flood level so as not to impede the flow of
water.
(1)
D.
§ 111-34 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 111-34
108:276
Determination of Loading Forces. Structural design shall consider
the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously during
the base flood on all building components.
The structural design shall be adequate to resist water forces
that would occur during the base flood. Horizontal water loads
considered shall include inertial and drag forces of waves,
current drag forces, and impact forces from waterborne storm
debris. Dynamic uplift loads shall also be considered if
bulkheads, walls, or other natural or man-made flow
obstructions could cause wave run-up beyond the elevation of
the base flood.
(a)
Buildings shall be designed and constructed to resist the forces
due to wind pressure. Wind forces on the superstructure
include windward and leeward forces on vertical walls, uplift
on the roof, internal forces when openings allow wind to enter
the house, and upward force on the underside of the house
when it is exposed. In the design, the wind should be assumed
to blow potentially from any lateral direction relative to the
house.
(b)
Wind loading values used shall be those required by the
building code.
(c)
(2)
Foundation Standards.
The pilings or column foundation and structure attached
thereto shall be adequately anchored to resist flotation,
collapse or lateral movement due to the effects of wind and
water pressures acting simultaneously on all building
components. Foundations must be designed to transfer safely
to the underlying soil all loads due to wind, water, dead load,
live load and other loads (including uplift due to wind and
water).
(a)
Spread footings and fill material shall not be used for
structural support of a new building or substantial
improvement of an existing structure.
(b)
(3)
Pile Foundation Design.
The design ratio of pile spacing to pile diameter shall not
be less than 8:1 for individual piles (this shall not apply to
pile clusters located below the design grade). The maximum
center-to-center spacing of wood piles shall not be more than
12 feet on center under load-bearing sills, beams, or girders.
(a)
Pilings shall have adequate soil penetration (bearing capacity)
to resist the combined wave and wind loads (lateral and uplift)
associated with the base flood acting simultaneously with
typical structure (live and dead) loads, and shall include
(b)
(4)
§ 111-34 (RESERVED) § 111-34
108:277
consideration of decreased resistance capacity caused by
erosion of soil strata surrounding the piles. The minimum
penetration for foundation piles is to an elevation of five feet
below mean sea level (msl) datum if the BFE is +10 msl or less,
or to be at least 10 feet below msl if the BFE is greater than
+10 msl.
Pile foundation analysis shall also include consideration of
piles in column action from the bottom of the structure to the
stable soil elevation of the site. Pilings may be horizontally or
diagonally braced to withstand wind and water forces.
(c)
The minimum acceptable sizes for timber piles are a tip
diameter of eight inches for round timber piles and eight
inches by eight inches for square timber piles. All wood piles
must be treated in accordance with requirements of EPEE-C3
to minimize decay and damage from fungus.
(d)

safety of the overall structure at the point of wall failure be
confirmed using established procedures. Grade beams shall be
installed in both directions for all piles considered to carry the
breakaway wall load. Knee braces are required for front row
piles that support breakaway walls.
(a)
Use of breakaway wall strengths in excess of 20 pounds per
square foot shall not be permitted unless a registered
professional engineer or architect has developed or reviewed
the structural design and specifications for the building
foundation and breakaway wall components, and certifies that
(1) the breakaway walls will fail under water loads less than
those that would occur during the base flood; and (2) the
elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation
system will not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other
structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads
acting simultaneously on all building components (structural
and nonstructural). Water loading values used shall be those
associated with the base flood. Wind loading values shall be
those required by the building code.

(6)
Conditions for Variances.
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre
or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided items
in Subsection A(4)(a) through (l) in § 111-35 have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(1)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
(a)
The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
(b)
(2)
Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and

Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification
of:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(b)
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
(c)
(6)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that the cost
of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from lowest floor elevation.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 127-1. Enactment.
Pursuant to the provisions of Article 34 of the New York State
Environmental Conservation Law and § 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law,
the City of New Rochelle, County of Westchester, State of New York, hereby
enacts by Local Law No. 2 of 1989, this chapter.
§ 127-2. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "City of New Rochelle
Coastal Erosion Hazard Area Law."
§ 127-3. When effective.
This chapter shall take effect 20 calendar days from its adoption and filing
pursuant to § 27 of the Municipal Home Rule Law or the date of filing the
official maps, whichever is later.
§ 127-4. Purpose.
The City of New Rochelle hereby assumes the responsibility and authority
to implement and administer a coastal erosion management program within
its jurisdiction pursuant to Article 34 of the New York State Environmental
Conservation Law. In addition, it is the purpose of this chapter to:
Establish standards and procedures for minimizing and preventing
damage to structures from coastal flooding and erosion and to protect
natural protective features and other natural resources.
A.
Regulate in coastal areas subject to coastal flooding and erosion land
use and development activities so as to minimize or prevent damage
or destruction to man-made property, natural protective features and
other natural resources and to protect human life.
B.
Regulate new construction or placement of structures in order to place
them a safe distance from areas of active erosion and the impacts
of coastal storms to ensure that these structures are not prematurely
destroyed or damaged due to improper siting, as well as to prevent
damage to natural protective features and other natural resources.
C.
Restrict public investment in services, facilities or activities which are
likely to encourage new permanent development in erosion hazard
areas.
D.
Regulate the construction of erosion protection structures in coastal
areas subject to serious erosion to assure that when the construction
of erosion protection structures is justified, their construction and
operation will minimize or prevent damage or destruction to man-made
E.
§ 127-1 CHRISTMAS TREES § 127-4

§ 127-5. Findings.
The City of New Rochelle finds that the coastal erosion areas:
§ 127-6. Definitions.
The following terms, as used in this chapter, shall have the meanings
indicated, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:
ADMINISTRATOR — The local official responsible for administering and
enforcing this chapter. The powers and duties of this position are more
fully described in § 127-29. The Commissioner of Public Works shall be the
"administrator."
BEACH — The zone of unconsolidated earth that extends landward from the
mean low-water line to the waterward toe of a dune or bluff whichever is
most waterward. Where no dune or bluff exists landward of a beach, the
landward limit of a beach is 100 feet landward from the place where there
is a marked change in material or physiographic form or from the line of
property, private and public property, natural protective features and
other natural resources.
Are prone to erosion from action of the Long Island Sound. Such
erosion may be caused by the action of waves, currents running along
the shore and wind-driven water and ice. Such areas are also prone to
erosion caused by the wind, runoff of rainwater along the surface of the
land or groundwater seepage, as well as by human activities such as
construction, navigation and certain forms of recreation.
A.
Experience coastal erosion which causes extensive damage to publicly
and privately owned property and to natural resources as well as
endangering human lives. When this occurs, individuals and private
businesses suffer significant economic losses, as do the City and state
economies, either directly through property damage or indirectly
through loss of economic return. Large public expenditures may also
be necessitated for the removal of debris and damaged structures and
replacement of essential public facilities and services.
B.
Experience erosion-related problems that are often contributed to by
man's building without considering the potential damage to property,
by undertaking activities which destroy natural protective features
such as dunes or vegetation, by building structures intended for erosion
prevention which may exacerbate erosion conditions on adjacent or
nearby property and by water action produced by wakes from boats.
C.
Are the subject of programs which foster erosion protection structures,
either with private or public funds, which are costly, often only partially
effective over time and may even be harmful to adjacent or nearby
properties. In some sections of the City, major erosion protection
structures of great length would be required to effectively reduce
future damages due to erosion.
D.
§ 127-4 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 127-6
125:314
permanent vegetation, whichever is most waterward. Shorelands subject
to seasonal or more frequent overwash or inundation are considered to be
beaches.
BLUFF — Any bank or cliff with a precipitous or steeply sloped face
adjoining a beach or a body of water. The waterward limit of a bluff is the
landward limits of it waterward natural protective features. Where no beach
is present, the waterward limit of a bluff is mean low water. The landward
limit is 25 feet landward of the receding edge or, in those cases where there
is no discernible line of active erosion, 25 feet landward of the point of
inflection on the top of the bluff. (The point of inflection is that point along
the top of the bluff where the trend of the land slope changes to begin its
descent to the shoreline.)
COASTAL EROSION HAZARD AREA MAP — The final map and any
amendments thereof issued by the Commissioner of the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation, which delineates boundaries of
coastal erosion hazard areas subject to regulation under this chapter.
COASTLINE and COASTAL WATERS — The lands adjacent to the City's
"coastal waters" is the "coastline." "Coastal waters" are the Long Island
Sound and its connecting water bodies, bays, harbors, shallows and
marshes.
DEBRIS LINE — A linear accumulation of waterborne debris deposited on a
beach by storm-induced high water or by wave action.
DUNE — A ridge or hill of loose, windblown or artificially placed earth, the
principal component of which is sand.
EROSION — The loss or displacement of land along the coastline due to
the action of waves, currents, wind-driven water, waterborne ice or other
impacts of storms. It also means the loss or displacement of land due to the
action of wind, runoff of surface waters or groundwaters or groundwater
seepage.
EROSION HAZARD AREA — An area of the coastline which is a structural
hazard area or a natural protective feature area.
EROSION PROTECTION STRUCTURE — A structure specifically designed
to reduce or prevent erosion such as a groin, jetty, revetment, breakwater
or artificial beach nourishment project.
EXISTING STRUCTURE — A structure and appurtenances in existence or
one where construction has commenced or one where construction has not
begun but for which a building permit has been issued prior to November
19, 1989, which is the effective date of this chapter.
GRADING — A redistribution of sand or other unconsolidated earth to effect
a change in profile.
MAJOR ADDITION — An addition to a structure resulting in a twenty-fivepercent
or greater increase in the ground area coverage of the structure
other than an erosion protection structure or a pier, dock or wharf. The
increase will be calculated as the ground area coverage to be added,
§ 127-6 CHRISTMAS TREES § 127-6
125:315
including any additions previously constructed under a coastal erosion
management permit, divided by the ground area coverage of the existing
structures as defined herein.
MEAN LOW WATER — The approximate average low water level for a given
body of water at a given location, determined by reference to hydrological
information concerning water levels or other appropriate tests.
MODIFICATION — Modification means a change in size, design or function.
MOVABLE STRUCTURE — A structure designed and constructed to be
readily relocated with minimum disruption of the intended use. Mobile
homes and structures built on skids or piles and not having permanent
foundation are examples of "movable structures."
NATURAL PROTECTIVE FEATURE — A nearshore area, beach, bluff,
primary dune, secondary dune or marsh and their vegetation.
NATURAL PROTECTIVE FEATURE AREA — A land and/or water area
containing natural protective features, the alteration of which might reduce
or destroy the protection afforded other lands against erosions or high
water or lower the reserve of sand or other natural materials available to
replenish storm losses through natural processes.
NEARSHORE AREA — Those lands under water beginning at the mean lowwater
line and extending waterward in a direction perpendicular to the
shoreline to a point where mean low-water depth is 15 feet or to a horizontal
distance of 1,000 feet from the mean low-water line, whichever is greater.
NORMAL MAINTENANCE — Periodic replacement or repair of same-kind
structural elements or protective coatings which do not change the size,
design or function of a functioning structure. A functioning structure is one
which is fully performing as originally designed at the time that normal
maintenance is scheduled to begin. Normal maintenance of a structure does
not require a coastal erosion management permit.
PERSON — Any individual, public or private corporation, political
subdivision, government agency, public improvement district, partnership,
association, firm, trust, estate or any other legal entity whatsoever.
PRIMARY DUNE — The most waterward major dune where there are two
or more parallel dunes within a coastal area. Where there is only one
dune present, it is the primary one. Occasionally, one or more relatively
small dune formations exist waterward of the "primary dune." These smaller
formations will be considered to be part of the "primary dune" for the
purposes of this chapter. The waterward limit of a "primary dune" is the
landward limit of its fronting beach. The landward limit of the "primary
dune" is 25 feet landward of its landward toe.
RECEDING EDGE — The most landward line of active erosion, or in cases
where there is no discernable line of active erosion, it is the most waterward
line of permanent vegetation.
RECEDING RATE — The rate, expressed in feet per year, at which an
eroding shoreline moves landward.
§ 127-6 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 127-6
125:316
RESTORATION — The reconstruction without modification of a structure,
the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the estimated full replacement
cost of the structure at the time of restoration. Modifications, however, may
be allowed if they do not exceed preexisting size limits and are intended to
mitigate impacts to natural protective features and other natural resources.
SECONDARY DUNE — The major dune immediately landward of the
primary dune. The waterward limit of a "secondary dune" is the landward
limit of its fronting primary dune. The landward limit of a "secondary dune"
is 25 feet landward of its landward toe.
SIGNIFICANT FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT — Those habitats which are
essential to the survival of a large portion of a particular fish or wildlife
population; support rare or endangered species; are found at a very low
frequency within a geographic area; support fish or wildlife populations
having significant commercial or recreational value; or would be difficult or
impossible to replace.
STRUCTURAL HAZARD AREA — Those shorelands located landward of
natural protective features and having shorelines receding at a long term
average recession rate of one foot or more per year. The inland boundary
of a "structural hazard area" is calculated by starting at the landward
limit of the fronting natural protective feature and measuring along a line
perpendicular to the shoreline a horizontal distance landward which is 40
times the long-term average annual recession rate.
STRUCTURE — Any object constructed, installed or placed in, on or under
land or water, including but not limited to a building; permanent shed;
deck; in-ground and aboveground pool; garage; mobile home; road; public
service distribution, transmission or collection system; tank; dock; pier;
wharf; groin, jetty or seawall; bulkhead; breakwater; revetment; artificial
beach nourishment; or any addition to or alteration of the same.
UNREGULATED ACTIVITY — Excepted activities which are not regulated
by this chapter, including but not limited to elevated walkways or stairways
constructed solely for pedestrian use and built by an individual property
owner for the limited purpose of providing noncommercial access to the
beach; docks, piers, wharves or structures built on floats, columns, open
timber piles or other similar openwork supports with a top surface area
of less than 200 square feet or which are removed in the fall of each
year; normal beach grooming or cleanup; maintenance of structures when
normal and customary and/or in compliance with an approved maintenance
program; planting vegetation and sand fencing so as to stabilize or entrap
sand in primary dune and secondary dune areas in order to maintain or
increase the height and width of dunes; routine agricultural operations,
including cultivation or harvesting, and in a soil and water conservation
plan as defined in § 3(12) of the Soil and Water Conservation Districts
Law; provided, however, that agricultural operations and implementation
of practices will not be construed to include any activity that involves the
construction or placement of a structure.
§ 127-6 CHRISTMAS TREES § 127-6
125:317
VEGETATION — Plant life capable of surviving and successfully
reproducing in the area or region and which is compatible with the
environment of the coastal erosion hazard area.
TOE — The lowest surface point on a slope face of a dune or bluff.

125:318
ARTICLE II
Standards and Restrictions
§ 127-7. Areas established; boundaries.
The coastal erosion hazard area is hereby established to classify land and
water areas within the City of New Rochelle based upon shoreline recession
rates or the location of natural protective features. The boundaries of the
area are established on the final map prepared by the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation under § 34-0104 of the New
York State Environmental Conservation Law and entitled "Coastal Erosion
Hazard Area Map of the City of New Rochelle," including all amendments
made thereto by the Commissioner of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation pursuant to § 34-0104 of the New York State
Environmental Conservation Law.
§ 127-8. Permit required for regulated activities.
No person may engage in any regulated activity in an erosion hazard area
as depicted on the Coastal Erosion Hazard Area Maps of the City of New
Rochelle, as amended, without first obtaining a coastal erosion management
permit. No coastal erosion management permit is required for unregulated
activities.
§ 127-9. General standards.
A coastal erosion management permit will be issued only with a finding by
the administrator that the proposed regulated activity meets the following
requirements:
§ 127-10. Structural hazard area restrictions.
The following restrictions apply to regulated activities within structural
hazard areas:
It is reasonable and necessary, considering reasonable alternatives to
the proposed activity and the extent to which the proposed activity
requires a shoreline location.
A.
It is not likely to cause a measurable increase in erosion at the proposed
site and at other locations.
B.
It prevents, if possible, or minimizes adverse effects on natural
protective features and their functions and protective values, existing
erosion protection structures and natural resources.
C.
A coastal erosion management permit is required for the installation of
public service distribution, transmission or collection systems for gas,
electricity, water or wastewater. Systems installed along the shoreline
must be located landward of the shoreline structures.
A.
§ 127-7 CHRISTMAS TREES § 127-10
125:319
§ 127-11. Nearshore area restrictions.
The construction of nonmovable structures or placement of major
nonmovable additions to an existing structure is prohibited.
B.
Permanent foundations may not be attached to movable structures, and
any temporary foundations are to be removed at the time the structure
is moved. Below-grade footings will be allowed if satisfactory provisions
are made for their removal.
C.
No movable structure may be located closer than 25 feet to the
landward limit of a bluff.
D.
No movable structure may be placed or constructed such that,
according to accepted engineering practice, its weight places excessive
groundloading on a bluff.
E.
Plans for landward relocation of movable structures must be included
with each application for a permit. Movable structures which have been
located within a structural hazard area pursuant to a coastal erosion
management permit must be removed before any part of the structure
is within 10 feet of the receding edge. The last owner of record,
as shown on the latest assessment roll, is responsible for removing
that structure and its foundation, unless a removal agreement was
attached to the original coastal erosion management permit. With the
attachment of a removal agreement to the coastal erosion management
permit, the landowner or the signator is responsible for the landward
relocation of movable structures. Removal agreements may be made
when the last owner of record and the owner of the structure are
different with the approval of the City at the time the permit is issued.
F.
Debris from structural damage which may occur as a result of sudden
unanticipated bluff edge failure, dune migration or wave or ice action
must be removed within 60 days of the damaging event.
G.
Any grading, excavation or other soil disturbance conducted within a
structural hazard area must not direct surface water runoff over a bluff
face.
H.
Nearshore areas dissipate a substantial amount of wave energy before
it is expended on beaches, bluffs or dunes by causing waves to collapse
or break. Nearshore areas also function as reservoirs of sand, gravel
and other unconsolidated material for beaches. Sandbars which are
located in nearshore areas control the orientation of incoming waves
and promote the development of ice cap formations which help protect
shorelines during winter storms. The roots of aquatic vegetation in
nearshore areas bind fine-grained silts, clays and organic matter to
form a fairly cohesive bottom that resists erosion.
A.
The following restriction shall apply to regulated activities in nearshore
areas:
B.
§ 127-10 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 127-11
125:320
§ 127-12. Beach area restrictions.
§ 127-13. Dune area restrictions.
Excavating, grading, mining or dredging which diminishes the
erosion protection afforded by nearshore areas is prohibited,
except construction or maintenance of navigation channels,
bypassing sand around natural and man-made obstructions and
artificial beach nourishment, all of which require a coastal erosion
management permit.
(1)
Clean sand or gravel of an equivalent or slightly larger grain size is
the only material which may be deposited within nearshore areas.
Any deposition will require a coastal erosion management permit.
(2)
All development is prohibited within nearshore areas unless
specifically provided for by this chapter.
(3)
Beaches buffer shorelands from erosion by absorbing wave energy that
otherwise would be expended on the toes of bluffs or dunes. Beaches
that are high and wide protect shorelands from erosion more effectively
than beaches that are low and narrow. Beaches also act as reservoirs of
sand or other consolidated material for longshore littoral transport and
offshore sandbar and shoal formation.
A.
The following restrictions shall apply to regulated activities within
beach areas:
Excavating, grading or mining which diminishes the erosion
protection afforded by beaches is prohibited.
(1)
Clean sand or gravel of an equivalent or slightly larger grain size is
the only material which may be deposited within beach areas. Any
deposition will require a coastal erosion management permit which
may be issued only for expansion or stabilization of beaches.
(2)
Active bird nesting and breeding areas must not be disturbed
unless such disturbance is pursuant to a specific wildlife
management activity approved, in writing, by the Department of
Environmental Conservation.
(3)
All development is prohibited on beaches unless specifically
provided for by this chapter.
(4)
The restoration of existing structures on beaches that are damaged
or destroyed by events not related to coastal flooding and erosion
shall not be undertaken without a coastal erosion management
permit.
(5)
B.
Dunes prevent overtopping and store sand for coastal processes. High,
vegetated dunes provide a greater degree of protection than low,
unvegetated ones. Dunes are of the greatest protective value during
A.
§ 127-11 CHRISTMAS TREES § 127-13
125:321
conditions of storm-induced high water. Because dunes often protect
some of the most biologically productive areas as well as developed

COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION ENERGY PROGRAM
GENERAL REFERENCES
Sustainable Energy Loan Program — See Ch.
284.
§ 131-1. Legislative findings; intent and purpose; authority.
It is the policy of both the City of New Rochelle and the State of
New York to reduce municipal operating costs while providing cost
certainty for the purpose of economic development, to promote deeper
penetration of energy efficiency and renewable energy resources such
as wind and solar, and wider deployment of distributed energy
resources as well as to examine the retail energy markets and increase
participation of and benefits for residential and small commercial
customers in those markets. Among the policies and models that may
offer benefits in New York is Community Choice Aggregation ("CCA"),
which allows local governments to determine the default supplier of
electricity and natural gas on behalf of its residential and Small
Commercial customers.
A.
The purpose of this CCA Program is to allow participating local
governments including the City of New Rochelle to procure energy
supply service for their residential and small commercial customers,
who will have the opportunity to opt out of the procurement, while
maintaining transmission and distribution service from the existing
distribution utility. This chapter establishes a program that will allow
the City of New Rochelle to put out for bid the total amount of natural
gas and/or electricity being purchased by local residential and small
commercial customers. Bundled customers will have the opportunity to
have more control to lower their overall energy costs, to spur clean
energy innovation and investment, to improve customer choice and
value, and to protect the environment; thereby, fulfilling the purposes
of this chapter and fulfilling an important public purpose.
B.
The City of New Rochelle is authorized to implement this Community
Choice Aggregation (Energy) Program pursuant to § 10(1)(ii)(a)(12)
of the New York Municipal Home Rule Law; and State of New York

Commission to Enable Community Choice Aggregation Programs
(issued December 15, 2104) to the extent that orders related to Case
No. 14-M-0224 enable actions by the City of New Rochelle not
otherwise permitted pursuant to orders related to Case 14-M-0564;

D.
A Community Choice Aggregation (Energy) Program is hereby
established by the City of New Rochelle, whereby the City of New
A.
§ 131-1 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 131-3
125:342
§ 131-4. Procedures for eligibility; customer data sharing.
Rochelle shall work together with Sustainable Westchester to
implement the CCA Program to the full extent permitted by the Order,
as set forth more fully herein. The City of New Rochelle's role under the
CCA Program involves the aggregating of the electric and/or natural
gas supply of its residents and the entering into a contract with one
or more suppliers for supply and services. Under the CCA Program,
the operation and ownership of the utility service shall remain with the
distribution utility.
The City of New Rochelle's purchase of energy supply through a CCA
Program constitutes neither the purchase of a public utility system,
nor the furnishing of utility service. The City of New Rochelle will not
take over any part of the electric or gas transmission or distribution
system and will not furnish any type of utility service, but will instead
negotiate with suppliers on behalf of participating residential and small
commercial customers.
B.
In order to implement the CCA Program, the City of New Rochelle will
adopt one or more measures that outline the process of and conditions
for participation in the CCA Program, including but not limited to
signing a contract for a compliant bid with one or more suppliers, all as
consistent with this chapter and the Order.
C.
The Public Service Commission supervises retail markets and
participants in these markets through legislative and regulatory
authority and the Uniform Business Practices, which includes rules
relating to the eligibility of participating ESCOs, the operation by which
ESCOs provide energy services, and the terms on which customers may
be enrolled with ESCOs.
D.
As permitted by the Order, the City of New Rochelle may request from
the distribution utilities aggregated customer information by fuel type
and service classification on a rolling basis.
A.
Sustainable Westchester, on behalf of the City of New Rochelle, shall
issue one or more requests for proposals to suppliers to provide energy
to participants and may then award a contract in accordance with the
CCA Program.
B.
Sustainable Westchester or the City of New Rochelle, if the City so
chooses, will then request individual customer data from the
distribution utility in accordance with the CCA Program.
C.
Sustainable Westchester or the City of New Rochelle, if the City so
chooses, and the selected supplier will then notify bundled customers of
the contract terms and their opportunity to opt out of the CCA Program.
D.
In accordance with and for purposes of the Order, the existing
distribution utility, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc.,
and/or New York State Electric and Gas Corporation, will provide to

FEES
Sustainable Westchester aggregate and customer-specific data
(including usage data capacity tag obligations, account numbers, and
service addresses) of all bundled customers in the City of New Rochelle
not currently enrolled with an ESCO.
Sustainable Westchester and the City of New Rochelle will protect
customer information as required by law, subject to the Order and the
limitations of the New York State Freedom of Information Law.
F.
The City of New Rochelle or in conjunction with the ESCO will notify
its residential and small commercial customers, by letter notice, of the
City of New Rochelle's decision to establish the CCA Program, of the
contract terms with an ESCO, and of the opportunity to opt out of the
CCA Program.
A.
The letter notice will be sent to each customer at the address provided
by the distribution utility and explain the CCA Program and the
material provisions of the ESCO contract, identify the methods by
which the customer can opt out of the CCA Program, and provide
information on how the customer can access additional information
about the CCA Program.
B.
C. The opt-out period shall be 20 days.
CCA Program bundled customers, upon enrollment, will receive a
welcome letter that will explain the customers' options for canceling
the enrollment if they believe they were enrolled incorrectly or
otherwise decide to withdraw from the CCA Program in favor of another
supplier. The welcome letter also will explain that residential customers
are entitled to the added protection of the mandated three-day
rescission period as detailed in Section 5(B)(3) of the Uniform Business
Practices.
D.
Sustainable Westchester shall be responsible for filing an annual report
with the Public Service Commission, which identifies the number of
customers enrolled in the CCA Program by municipality and customer
class, the number of customers who returned to utility service or
service with another supplier during the reporting period, and the
average cost of commodity supply by month for the reporting period.

construction in a designated historic district and no demolition in such
district or of a landmark shall be commenced without a certificate
of appropriateness having first been issued. The certificate of
appropriateness required by this section shall be in addition to and not
in lieu of any building, sign or other permit that may be required by any
state or local law or regulation. [Amended 11-18-2008 by Ord. No.

In passing upon an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the
Historical and Landmark Review Board shall not consider changes to
interior spaces, except in cases where the interiors of public buildings

Issuance of certificate.
Within 90 days after a complete application is filed, the Board shall
conduct a public hearing and shall then determine whether the
proposed material change will be appropriate to the preservation
of the district or the landmark in view of the purposes of this
chapter. In passing upon appropriateness, the Board shall consider,
in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and
architectural style, general design arrangement, texture, material
and color of the building component or sign involved and the
relationship thereof to other structures in the immediate
neighborhood or district. [Amended 11-18-2008 by Ord. No.
212-2008]
With respect to construction, the Board shall take into
consideration the visual relationship between the property in
question and existing structures either immediately adjacent
to or in the surrounding area and the character of the district
and the extent to which a new or altered structure would
be harmonious with or incongruous to the historic and
architectural qualities or distinctive aspects of the district.
(a)
With respect to demolition, in whole or in part, of a landmark
or building located in an historic district, the Board shall
consider whether:
The continued existence of the building as a landmark or
as part of an historic district prevents the owner from
realizing a reasonable return on the property as specified
in the hardship criteria in § 170-5 herein.
[1]
The building is of such architectural or historical interest
that its removal would be to the detriment of the public
interest.
[2]
The building is of such interest that it could be made into
an historic landmark.
[3]
The building is of such old and unusual or uncommon
design, texture and material that it could not be
reproduced or could be reproduced only with great
difficulty.
[4]
Retention of the building would help preserve and protect
an historic place or area of historic interest in the City.
[5]
Retention will promote the general welfare by maintaining
and increasing real estate values and encourage interest
in American history and architecture.

§ 170-5 (RESERVED) § 170-5
165:477
The Board shall, when applying design criteria guidelines to
determine whether certificates of appropriateness should be
granted, consider its previous applications and determination
of same so as to maximize fairness and equal treatment under
the law. However, exercise of discretion in favor of one confers
no right upon another to demand the same decision. The Board
may give weight to slight differences which may not be easily
discernible but provide a rational basis for distinguishing its
decision from contrary prior determinations. [Added
9-20-2001 by Ord. No. 190-2001]
(c)
If the Board approves the material change proposed, the Board
shall issue a certificate of appropriateness, which shall specify
the work to be done. In issuing such certificate, the Board may
prescribe any conditions that it deems to be necessary to carry
out the intent and purposes of this chapter. A certificate issued
pursuant to this section shall relate solely to proposed plans
accompanying the application or otherwise submitted to the Board
for official consideration prior to issuance of said certificate. It shall
be unlawful to deviate from the plans, including any modifications
required as a condition of the issuance of such certificate, unless
and until an amended certificate shall be applied for and issued.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board shall not issue any such
certificate if it has been advised by the Building Official that there
is an impediment to the issuance of any building, sign or other
permit, as may be required by applicable state or local law or
regulation, for said work. The official certificate of appropriateness
(or copy which was received from the Board upon approval of the
application must be prominently displayed at the property, and
it must be clearly visible to the public while work is underway.
[Amended 9-20-2001 by Ord. No. 190-2001]
(2)
With respect to an application to raze a landmark or a structure
located in an historic district, the Historical and Landmark Review
Board shall have the right to issue a delayed certificate of
appropriateness. Such certificate shall not permit demolition or
razing for a period of up to four months from the date of issuance
of the delayed certificate of appropriateness therefor, during which
time the Board and the applicant shall undertake serious and
continued discussion for the purpose of finding a method to save
such property. During such period, the applicant and the Board
shall cooperate in attempting to avoid demolition of the property. At
the end of this four-month period, if no mutually agreeable method
of saving the subject property bearing a reasonable prospect of
eventual success is underway or if no formal application for funds
from any government unit or nonprofit organization to preserve
the subject property is pending, the Building Official may issue the
permit to demolish the property without the approval of the Board.
If such mutually agreeable method for saving the subject property
is not successful or no such funds to preserve the subject property
(3)
§ 170-5 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 170-5
165:478
have been obtained and available for disbursement within a period
of two months following the end of such four-month period, the
Building Official may issue the permit to demolish the property
without the approval of the Board.
If the Board determines that a certificate of appropriateness should
not be issued or that a delayed certificate or a certificate
contingent upon specific structural performance should not be
issued, the Board shall notify the applicant, in writing, of such
determination and of the Board's reasons therefor and shall file
such notice with the City Clerk. Such notice shall advise the
applicant of his right to appeal such determination to a court of
competent jurisdiction in the State of New York within 30 days of
the filing of the written notice.
(4)
Unless the action of the Historical and Landmark Review Board is
reversed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Building Official
shall refuse to grant a building permit or sign or demolition or
other permit in an historic district or involving a landmark where a
certificate of appropriateness has been denied or where the grant
of such permit is not within the terms and conditions of such
certificate of appropriateness as has been granted.
(5)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board fails to issue a
certificate of appropriateness or notify the applicant of its
determination not to issue a certificate within 90 days after such
application therefor is filed, or within such additional time period
as the Board and the applicant may agree, such application shall be
deemed approved.
(6)
Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as authorizing
the Historical and Landmark Review Board, in acting with respect
to an application for a certificate of appropriateness or in adopting
regulations in relation thereto, to waive any regulation or laws relating
to zoning and planning of the City of New Rochelle. The Board may, in
exercising its powers and performing its functions under this chapter,
with reference to an historic district or a landmark, apply or impose,
with respect to the construction, reconstruction, alteration, demolition
or use of any structure or sign, determinations or conditions which
are more restrictive than those prescribed or made by or pursuant to
the applicable regulations contained herein or to any other applicable
provisions of law.
E.
Any certificate of appropriateness and any permit to raze a building
issued pursuant to these rules and regulations shall expire of its own
limitation 12 months from the date of issuance if the work authorized
thereby is not commenced by the end of such twelve-month period; and
further, any such certificate and permit shall also expire and become
null and void if such authorized work is suspended and abandoned for
a period of 12 months after being commenced. Any period or periods
of time during which the right to use any such certificate or permit is

Hardship criteria. An applicant whose certificate of appropriateness
has been denied may apply for relief from the strict criteria as
established for district or landmark designation on the grounds that
designation is working a hardship upon him. In order to prove the
existence of hardship, the applicant shall establish that:
The property is incapable of earning a reasonable return,
regardless of whether that return represents the most profitable
return possible;
(1)
The property cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by
the current owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a
reasonable return;
(2)
Efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the property and
preserving it have failed;
(3)
The cost of alterations or replacement according to strict
application of the design criteria is prohibitive in comparison with
the cost of a reasonably compatible alternative; or
(4)
The replacement of an existing feature on a building is necessary
for safety reasons.
(5)
A.
Hardship application procedure.
After receiving written notification from the Board of the denial of
a certificate of appropriateness, an applicant may commence the
hardship process. No building permit or demolition permit shall be
issued unless the Board makes a finding that a hardship exists.
(1)
The Board may hold a public hearing on the hardship application
at which an opportunity will be provided for proponents and
opponents of the application to present their views.
(2)
The applicant shall consult in good faith with the Board, local
preservation groups and interested parties in a diligent effort to
seek an alternative that will result in preservation of the property
and compatibility with the established design criteria.
(3)
All decisions of the Board shall be in writing. A copy shall be sent
to the applicant by registered mail and a copy filed with the City
Clerk's office for public inspection. The Board's decision shall state
the reasons for granting or denying the hardship application.

Review Board, the Building Official shall issue a stop-work order,
and all work shall immediately cease. No further work shall be
undertaken on the project as long as a stop-work order is in effect.
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued if it is found that the
completed work is not in compliance with the certificate of
appropriateness. [Amended 9-20-2001 by Ord. No. 190-2001]

Any person who shall fail to comply with a written order of the
Building Official within the time fixed for compliance therewith,

Abatement of violations. Appropriate actions and proceedings may be
taken at law or in equity to prevent unlawful construction or demolition

privately and publicly owned dwellings for the purpose of maintaining
interior portions thereof which, if not so maintained, may cause or tend
to cause the exterior portions of such improvements to deteriorate,
decay or become damaged or otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair.
In any case where the Building Official shall order or direct the
construction, removal, alteration or demolition of any improvement on
a landmark site or in an historic district for the purpose of remedying
conditions determined to be dangerous to life, health or property,
nothing contained herein shall be construed to make it unlawful for
any person, without prior issuance of a certificate of appropriateness,
to comply with such order or direction. The Building Official shall give
the Historical and Landmark Review Board notice of any such proposed
order or direction, and the Board shall have the power to require that
the work not materially change the exterior appearance where the
danger of life, health or property may be abated without detracting
from the exterior appearance.
B.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature of any
structure, whether a landmark or within an historic district or
otherwise, which does not involve a change in design, material, color or
outer appearance thereof.

§ 178-1. Purpose.
Natural, pervious surfaces have a direct relationship to the health, safety
and welfare of the community since the percolation of rainfall through
soils reduces erosion and flooding, contributes to the replenishment of
groundwater and groundwater ecosystems, provides for the removal of
pollutants contained in surface waters, reduces the need for the public
construction of storm drains, basins, and other off-site structures, provides
a medium for the planting and maintenance of groundcover and trees,
reduces heat and the need for air conditioning, absorbs air pollution, and
adds to the aesthetic quality of the community. The covering of natural
pervious surfaces with macadam, concrete, tiles, bricks, roofs, and other
impervious surfaces for the creation of subdivisions and for residential and
nonresidential development on private lots, even when dry-wells and other
on-site storage and treatment systems are utilized, contributes to higher
ambient temperatures and greater demand for energy, increased loss of
habitat for insects, birds, and other wildlife, covering of productive topsoil,
global warming and ozone depletion, water pollution, all of which adversely
affect the inhabitants of the City of New Rochelle. Trees are recognized as
being able to mitigate the negative effects described above.

neglects, refuses or fails to comply with any order or notice issued
hereunder shall be guilty of an offense punishable by a fine not to
exceed $250 or by imprisonment for a term not to exceed 15 days,
or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional offense or violation.

§ 178-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
APPLICANT — A person requesting a permit to create or increase
impervious surface by 200 square feet or greater from the City of New
Rochelle or a person to whom a permit has been given.
APPROVING AUTHORITY — The Planning Board in the case of site plan
and subdivision applications and the Building Official or his designee for all
other applications.
DESIGN PROFESSIONAL — A landscape architect, registered architect,
professional engineer, arborist, professional forester, or other licensed

PERSON — Any individual person, firm, partnership, association,
corporation, company, organization or legal entity of any kind, but not
including federal, state, county or municipal public agencies or
corporations.
§ 178-3. Creation or expansion of impervious surface.
On private property, no person who, by existing zoning or land development
regulations or by building code requirements, requires or will require a
building permit for new construction, building expansion, parking area,
driveway, swimming pool, or other structure shall be permitted to create
impervious surface or to expand any existing impervious surface by more
than 200 square feet, utilizing macadam, concrete, tiles or bricks with
mortar, asphalt shingles, slate, plastic, or other similar impervious material,
through the construction of buildings, carports, driveways, walkways,
patios, pools, roadways, sidewalks, or other similar structures without first
obtaining a permit from the Bureau of Buildings and without required
mitigation as approved by the approval authority as part of the building
permit process, in accordance with in § 178-5. The permit to create or
increase impervious surface by more than 200 square feet shall be part of
the existing building permit application and approval process. Where that
building permit approval process by Code requires prior approval by the
Planning Board, as in the case of site plans, subdivisions, and some special
permit uses, the Planning Board shall be the approval authority. In all
other cases, where a building permit is required by Code for construction,
demolition, site work, or development, the Building Official shall be the
approval authority.
§ 178-4. Granting of building permit for creating or expanding
impervious surface.
The applicant for such a building permit seeking approval to create or
expand in excess of 200 square feet of impervious surface shall include
§ 178-2 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 178-4
174:492
a schedule precisely calculating the increased area of impervious surface
on the parcel or lot for which the building permit is being sought, which
schedule shall be clear enough to allow verification by Bureau of Buildings
staff. The applicant shall also clearly calculate and summarize the total
additional diameter of trees proposed to be planted. Plans submitted with
the building permit application shall indicate where trees are proposed to
be planted and shall identify species and DBH of proposed trees to enable
Bureau of Buildings staff verification.
§ 178-5. Mitigation for creating or increasing impervious surface.
To mitigate the negative environmental impacts associated with the
creation or expansion of impervious surfaces, for every 200 square feet of
impervious surface created or expanded or part thereof in excess of the first
200 square feet, the property owner shall plant one tree with a minimum
DBH of two inches. Trees with a greater DBH may satisfy this requirement
in a mathematically proportionate manner, so that, for example, a tree
with four-inch DBH may be planted for 400 square feet of newly created
or expanded impervious surface beyond the first 200 square feet. In the
event trees are proposed to be removed and replaced under Chapter 301,
Trees and Shrubs, of the City Code, the greater required total DBH of
new trees between this chapter and Chapter 301 shall control. In lieu of
planting trees on site and only when technically impractical or impossible,
a fee shall be paid to the City Tree Fund to defray the City's costs for
acquisition maintenance and planting of trees elsewhere on City properties,
in accordance with Chapter 133 (Fees) of the City Code.
§ 178-6. Planting of trees.
The planting of tree(s) shall be in accordance with the specifications of
the landscape nursery from which the tree(s) is purchased or of a licensed
design professional. Lacking specifications, the planting of trees shall be as
follows:
For every inch of tree diameter planted, there shall be a minimum of
nine square feet of pervious soil surrounding the tree trunk, to allow
water and air to the tree roots. For a minimum two-inch-diameter tree,
therefore, there shall be a minimum of 18 square feet of pervious soil
surrounding the tree trunk.
A.
No tree shall be planted closer to another tree, existing or proposed,
with less than 20 feet of horizontal spacing from center of tree. In the
event that a landscape nursery from which the tree is purchased or
the design professional recommends a greater horizontal spacing, such
spacing shall govern.
B.
Trees shall be planted only during the period from September 1 to May
15.
C.
§ 178-4 HOUSING STANDARDS § 178-7
174:493
§ 178-7. Maintenance of trees planted. [Amended 7-20-2004 by Ord.
No. 148-2004]
Where the number of trees to be planted on the property exceeds 20,
a performance and maintenance bond, cash deposit or other surety
acceptable to Corporation Counsel shall be posted by the applicant to
guarantee the planting of trees and the maintenance of trees as shown
on the approved plans for a period of five years, in accordance with the
requirements described in § 331-119(4)(a) of the Zoning Code.
§ 178-8. Conformance with the Zoning Code and Land Development
Regulations.
Where the Zoning Code, Chapter 331, and Land Development Regulations,
Chapter A361, also require a specific number and distribution of trees in
conjunction with development of parking lots and other projects, the trees
required in this chapter may serve to partially satisfy those requirements.
However, in no event shall the total mitigation in terms of tree diameter
required by increasing impervious surfaces in this chapter or by removal
of trees in Chapter 301 of the City Code be reduced by zoning or land
development regulations. The planting of tree(s) shall be completed prior
to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy on the building lot for which a
building permit has been issued.

This amendment is designed to meet the public demand for safe and
unobstructed streets, sidewalks and other public places and to prevent
large numbers of people from gathering in places open to the public for
the purpose of conducting illegal activity. This amendment is also designed
to prevent people from gathering in restricted public places that are not
open to the general public. The City Council finds that in order to protect
public safety and preserve the character of the City's neighborhoods and
quality of life for its residents, it is necessary to adopt the following loitering
ordinance. While it is understood that public places are free to be used
by the public, it is also understood that individuals and groups shall not
stand or congregate in such areas in order to conduct illegal activity. It
is also understood that restricted public places are not open to the public
at large and should be restricted to persons utilizing the public facilities.
The City Council specifically finds that the New Rochelle train station, the
New Rochelle Public Library and the New Rochelle municipal garages are
facilities that should be so restricted in order to assure the safety and
comfort of persons utilizing these public facilities. The City Council hereby
resolves that it shall be a violation of the Code of the City of New Rochelle
to loiter in a public place for the purpose of conducting illegal activity. The
Council further resolves that it shall be a violation of the Code of the City
of New Rochelle to loiter within the New Rochelle train station, the New
Rochelle Public Library and the New Rochelle municipal garages.
No person shall loaf or loiter on any street or other public place for
the purpose of using illegal drugs, as defined under the Mental Hygiene
Law, drinking in public or any other offense punishable under the penal
law or the Code of the City of New Rochelle.
A.
No person shall loaf or loiter within the New Rochelle train station
except patrons of the train station, taxicab company, coffee shop or drycleaning
establishment. Due notice of this restriction shall be posted by
the Police Department.
B.
No person shall loaf or loiter within the New Rochelle Public Library.
Due notice of this restriction shall be posted by the Police Department.
C.
No person shall loaf or loiter within any New Rochelle municipal
parking garage. Due notice of this restriction shall be posted by the
Police Department.

(4)
C.
§ 215-9 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 215-9
213:542
impervious areas. If it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the Planning Board that retention basins or extended detention
facilities are not practical alternatives, other methods
recommended in the current NYSDEC Stormwater Management
Guidelines, such as reducing the impacts of stormwater runoff from
new development, may be used as substitutes. Substitutes may also
include the use of dry wells, swales, grit and/or oil separator and
filter strips. The basin and all the necessary appurtenances shall be
in accordance with the Department of Public Works requirements.
In addition, the applicant shall utilize the Westchester County Best
Management Practices Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control
to prepare a sediment control plan acceptable to the Building
Official. Oil/Grit separators or other water quality structures
designed to capture oils and sediments shall be constructed to
permit access for inspection and maintenance, and the owner shall
submit maintenance reports together with a signed and notarized
certification on a form supplied by the Building Official twice per
year, once between April 15 and May 30 and once between October
15 and November 30, certifying that the oil/grit separator or other
water quality structure was inspected and cleaned out during the
above-described time periods and that said separators or other
water quality structures are in working order. The owner shall
be further required to post a long-term maintenance bond with
respect to the performance of the maintenance required herein. If
the maintenance bond expires or is used by the City in order to
conduct the required inspection and cleaning in the event of default
by the owner, then the City may serve an abatement notice for
further expenses incurred by or on behalf of the City pursuant to
the procedures set forth in § 200 of the City Charter.
Applications requiring Planning Board approval that involve
disturbing more than one acre of land during construction must
satisfy the applicable requirements of the Phase II SPDES general
permit, and the standards of the NYSDEC for approval.
Documentation shall be provided to the Board demonstrating
that the following requirements have been met, which shall
be prepared by a professional engineer, landscape architect or
certified professional in erosion and sediment control:
Management of soil erosion and sediment control during
and after construction, in accordance with the
Westchester County Best Management Practices Manual
for Erosion and Sediment Control and NYSDEC
requirements, whichever is more restrictive.

§ 215-9 NOISE § 215-9
213:543
§ 215-10. Monitoring of discharges.
All soil erosion and sediment control plans, design of splitter
boxes, design of oil/grit separators, and water quality
treatment measures and detention shall conform to the
standards of the NYSDEC. Compliance shall be detailed on the
plans submitted to the Planning Board for approval.
(b)
Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater
discharges associated with industrial activity or construction activity.
A.
Access to Facilities.
The Building Official shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may
be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a
discharger has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
(1)
Facility operators shall allow the Building Official ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the
conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the
performance of any additional duties as defined by state and
federal law.
(2)
The Building Official shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or
sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
(3)
The Building Official has the right to require the discharger to
install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling
and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a
safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own
expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality
shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(4)
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access
to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the
Building Official and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing
such access shall be borne by the operator.
(5)
Unreasonable delays in allowing the Building Official access to a
permitted facility are a violation of a stormwater discharge permit
and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a
NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with Industrial
Activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized
enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for
(6)
B.
§ 215-9 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 215-10
213:544
the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by
this chapter.
If the Building Official has been refused access to any part of
the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is
able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be
a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/
or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency
may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.
(7)
Maintenance and Inspection Requirements.
During Construction. The applicant or developer of the land
development activity or his or her representative shall at all times
properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of
treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are
installed or used by the applicant or developer to achieve
compliance with the conditions of this chapter. Sediment shall
be removed from sediment traps or sediment ponds whenever
their design capacity has been reduced by 50%. The applicant
or developer or representative shall be on site at all times when
construction or grading activity takes place and shall inspect and
document the effectiveness of all erosion and sediment control
practices. Inspection reports shall be completed every seven days
and within 24 hours of any storm event producing 0.5 inch of
precipitation or more. Inspection reports shall be delivered to the
Stormwater Management Officer and copied to a site log book.
(1)
After Construction.
Prior to the issuance of any approval that includes permanent
stormwater management practices ("SMP"), the applicant or
developer must execute a maintenance easement agreement
that shall be binding on all subsequent landowners. The
easement shall provide for access to the premises at
reasonable times for periodic inspection by the City of New
Rochelle to ensure that the SMP is maintained in proper
working condition to meet design standards and any other
provisions established by this chapter. The easement shall be
recorded by the grantor in the office of the County Clerk after
approval by the Corporation Counsel.
(a)
The owner or operator of permanent SMP installed in
accordance with this chapter shall ensure that it is operated
and maintained to achieve the goals of this chapter. Proper
operation and maintenance also includes, as a minimum, the
following:

C.
§ 215-10 NOISE § 215-10
213:545
§ 215-11. Retention of expert assistance and reimbursement by
applicant.
A preventive/corrective maintenance program for all
critical facilities and systems of treatment and control (or
related appurtenances) which are installed or used by the
owner or operator to achieve the goals of this chapter.
[1]
Written procedures for operations and maintenance and
training new maintenance personnel.
[2]
Discharges from the SMPs shall not exceed design criteria
or cause or contribute to water quality standard violations.
[3]
Maintenance Agreements. The applicable approval authority shall
approve a formal maintenance agreement binding on all
subsequent landowners and recorded in the office of the County
Clerk as a deed restriction on the property prior to final plan
approval. The City of New Rochelle, in lieu of a maintenance
agreement, at its sole discretion may accept dedication of any
existing or future SMP, provided such facilities meet all of the
requirements of this chapter and includes adequate area, by
easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance.
(3)
The City may hire any consultant and/or expert necessary to assist
the City in reviewing and evaluating the SWPPP, including the cost
of inspections during construction and postconstruction maintenance
requirements under this chapter.
A.
An applicant shall deposit with the City funds sufficient to reimburse
the City for all reasonable costs of consultant and expert fees. The
initial deposit shall be $10,000, which shall be placed in an escrow
account at the time of submission of the application. The City's
consultants/experts shall invoice the City for their services in reviewing
the application or performing inspection/maintenance work. If at any
time during the process this escrow account has a balance less than
$1,000, the applicant shall immediately, upon notification by the City,
replenish said escrow account so that it has a balance of at least $3,000.
Such additional escrow funds shall be deposited with the City before
any further action or consideration is taken on the application. In the
event that the amount held in escrow by the City is more than the
amount of the actual invoicing for work performed through the date
of issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the remaining funds shall be
reimbursed to the applicant. The applicant shall, prior to the issuance
of the Certificate of Occupancy, submit a long-term bond in an amount
to be determined by the Commissioner of Public Works for maintenance
to be conducted by the City as required by this chapter.
B.
The total amount of the funds needed may vary with the scope and
complexity of the project, the completeness of the application or
certification and other information as may be needed to complete the

§ 215-12. Use of Best Management Practices to Prevent, Control,
and Reduce Stormwater Pollutants.
The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at its own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and
nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or
premises, which is, or may be, the source of an Illegal Discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and
nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be
deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be
part of a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) as necessary for
compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
§ 215-13. Watercourse Protection.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse,
so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or
physical integrity of the watercourse.
§ 215-14. Notification of Spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the Storm Drain
System, or water of the United States, said person shall take all necessary
steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release.
In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall
immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in
person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the Building Official within three business days of
the phone notice. If the illegal discharge of prohibited materials emanates
from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of
necessary review, analysis, inspection and maintenance as required by
this chapter.
§ 215-11 NOISE § 215-14
213:547
such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records
shall be retained for at least three years.
§ 215-15. Enforcement.
Notice of Violation.
Whenever the Building Official or Commissioner of Public Works'
representative finds that a person has violated a prohibition or
failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the authorized
enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of
violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require,
without limitation:
(a) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;

(1)
If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property
is required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which
such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice
shall further advise that, should the violator fails to remediate or
restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 200 of the City Charter.
(2)
Appeal of Notice of Violation. Any person receiving a Notice of
Violation may appeal the determination of the Authorized
Enforcement Agency. The notice of appeal must be received within
10 days from the date of the Notice of Violation. Hearing on the
appeal before the City Manager or his/her designee shall take place
within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The
decision of the municipal authority or its designee shall be final.
(3)

book by this section, and no charge shall be made or received by any

said ticket, note or memorandum so lost, and upon his giving to the
pawnbroker or collateral loan broker an exact description of the article
pawned, the pawnbroker or collateral loan broker shall issue a second
or stop ticket for the same. In case such pawner neglects to so apply
and examine said books and receive such memorandum or note in the
manner above-stated, the pawnbroker or collateral loan broker will
be bound to deliver the pledge to any person producing such ticket
for the redemption thereof. This section is not to be construed as in
any manner limiting or affecting such pawnbroker's or collateral loan
broker's common law liability in cases where goods are stolen or other
legal defects of title exist in the pledger.

ARTICLE III
Panhandling
[Adopted 1-20-2015 by Ord. No. 12-2015]
§ 231-5. Legislative intent.
This article is adopted in order to protect persons from threatening,
intimidating or harassing behavior, to keep public places safe and attractive
for use by all members of the community and to maintain and preserve
public places where all of the community can interact in a peaceful manner.
This legislation is also intended to provide for the free flow of pedestrian
and vehicular traffic on streets and sidewalks in the City, to promote tourism
and business and preserve the quality of urban life. The City Council finds
that aggressive acts associated with solicitation tend to interfere with the
free flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and intimidate persons in public
places, and can lead to disruption and disorder in public places. Aggressive
acts can also cause persons to avoid public places and lead to declining
patronage of commercial establishments and tourism. The City Council
further finds that solicitation in certain public places is inconsistent with
the use of those places, is inherently intimidating, targets persons who are
captive audiences or constitutes an invasion of privacy as persons are not
able to simply move on if they do not wish to speak to the person soliciting.
Solicitation in proximity to transportation centers, municipal parking
facilities, bank entrances, check-cashing businesses, automated teller
machines or other automated devices where a person is required to make a
payment by any means is inherently intimidating and should be restricted.
By this legislation, the Council intends to promote the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens and visitors to the City.
§ 231-6. Panhandling.
Term defined.
As used in this section, "panhandling" means any solicitation made
in person upon any street, public place or park in the City in
which a person requests an immediate donation of money or other
gratuity from another person, and includes but is not limited to
seeking donations:
By vocal appeal or for music, singing, or other street
performance; and
(a)
Where the person being solicited receives an item of little
or no monetary value in exchange for a donation, under
circumstances where a reasonable person would understand
that the transaction is in substance a donation.
(b)
(1)
However, panhandling shall not include the act of passively
standing or sitting or performing music, singing or other street
performance with a sign or other indication that a donation is being

sought, without any vocal request other than in response to an
inquiry by another person.
It shall be unlawful to engage in an act of panhandling when either
the panhandler or the person being solicited is located at any of the
following locations: at a bus stop; in any public transportation vehicle
or public transportation facility; in a vehicle which is parked or stopped
on a public street or alley; in a sidewalk cafe; or within 20 feet in any

manner, including any of the following actions:

consent;
(1)
Panhandling a person while such person is standing in line and
waiting to be admitted to a commercial establishment;
(2)
Blocking the path of a person being solicited, or the entrance to any
building or vehicle;
(3)
Following behind, ahead or alongside a person who walks away
from the panhandler after being solicited;
(4)
Using profane or abusive language, either during the solicitation or
following a refusal to make a donation, or making any statement
gesture, or other communication which would cause a reasonable
person to be fearful or feel compelled; or
(5)
(6) Panhandling in a group of two or more persons.
C.
Each act of panhandling prohibited by this section shall constitute a
public nuisance and a separate violation of this Code. Each violation
shall be punishable as provided in this article, and the court may enjoin
any such violator from committing further violations of this section.

in organizing or sponsoring this event.

Bureau of Buildings, or both.

exceeding $250 or by imprisonment of not more than 15 days, or both
fine and imprisonment, provided that the penalty shall be not less than
$80 for a second offense within a twelve-month period and not less
than $100 for a third offense within a twelve-month period. Each day on
which the violation exists may be charged and shall be considered as a

(c)
(d) Permit.
§ 242-12 PERFORMANCE BONDS § 242-12
238:601
It shall be unlawful for any person to install or cause to be
installed any service piping, gas piping, gas water heater
or other gas appliances without first obtaining a permit
from the Plumbing Inspector.
[1]
Permits for gas piping shall show the total number of gas
outlets to be provided for and such other information as
may be required by the Plumbing Inspector.
[2]
Inspections.
Upon completion of the installation of any gas piping on
the outlet side of the gas meter and/or gas water heater
and prior to the use thereof, the Plumbing Inspector shall
be notified that such piping and/or water heater is ready
for inspection.
[1]
The Plumbing Inspector shall make the following
inspections and shall either approve that portion of the
work as completed or shall notify the permit holder
wherein the same fails to comply with this code:
Rough piping inspection. This inspection shall be
made after all gas piping authorized by the permit has
been installed and before any such piping has been
covered or concealed or any fixture or appliance has
been attached thereto.
[a]
Pressure test. This inspection will include a
determination of the test of piping for tightness, that
gas piping installation shall stand a pressure of at
least six inches of mercury or of three pounds per
square inch for a period of not less than 10 minutes
without showing any drop in pressure and that the
installation meets the requirements of this code. For
welded piping, the test pressure shall be 50 pounds
per square inch and shall be made using air only.
All necessary apparatus for conducting either method
of pressure testing shall be furnished by the permit
holder, and the test shall be made in the presence of
the Plumbing Inspector.
[b]
Test of piping for tightness. Before any system of gas
piping is finally put in service, it shall be carefully
tested by the permit holder to assure that it is
gastight. Where any part of the system is to be
enclosed or concealed, this test shall precede the work
of closing in. To test for tightness, the piping may be
filled with city gas, air or inert gas, but not with any
other gas or liquid. In no case shall oxygen ever be
used. The piping shall stand a pressure of at least
six inches of mercury, measured with a manometer or
[c]
[2]
(e)
§ 242-12 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 242-12
238:602
slope gauge, for a period of not less than 10 minutes
without showing any drop in pressure.
Additional piping. In cases where the work authorized
by the permit consists of additional piping to be
installed on gas piping already connected to a gas
meter, the foregoing inspections may be waived. In
this event, the Plumbing Inspector shall require such
inspections as he deems advisable in order to assure
himself that the work has been performed in
accordance with the intent of this code.
[d]
Final inspection. A final inspection shall be made
when all appliances are connected and all outlets
capped, the gas meter is installed and the following
has been done by the permit holder.
[e]
Turning on gas. Close all gas outlets before turning
gas under pressure into any piping. The permit holder
or gas utility corporation shall close all openings from
which gas can escape.
[f]
Checking for leakage with meter. Immediately after
turning gas into piping, the system shall be checked
to ascertain that no gas is escaping. This shall be
done by the permit holder or gas utility corporation
by carefully watching the test dial of the meter to
determine whether gas is passing through the meter.
To assist in observing any movement of the test hand,
wet a small piece of paper and paste its edge directly
over the center line of the hand as soon as the gas is
turned on. Allow five minutes for a one-half-foot dial
and proportionally longer for a larger dial in checking
for gas flow. This observation shall be made with the
test hand on the upstroke.
[g]
In case test hand does not move. In case careful
observation of the test hand for a sufficient length of
time reveals no movement, the pipe shall be purged
(see provisions of Subsection H(1)(e)[2][j], [k] and [l])
and a small gas burner turned on and lighted and the
hand of the test dial again observed. If this dial hand
now moves (as it should), it will show that the meter is
operating properly. If the test hand does not move or
register the flow of gas through the meter to the small
burner, it is certain that the meter is defective, and the
gas shall be turned off and the gas utility corporation
notified.
[h]
In case meter test hand moves. In case the test hand
shows movement, all appliances or outlets supplied
[i]
§ 242-12 PERFORMANCE BONDS § 242-12
238:603
through the meter shall be examined to see if they
are turned off and do not leak. If they are found tight,
movement of the test hand will indicate that there
is a leak in the piping system. The meter valve shall
be turned off until the necessary repairs have been
made, after which the test specified in Subsection
H(1)(e)[2][g] shall be repeated.
Purging all gas lines. After the piping has been
checked, all piping receiving gas through the meter
shall be fully purged. A suggested method for purging
the gas line to an appliance is to disconnect the pilot
line at the outlet of the pilot valve. Under no
circumstances shall a line be purged into the
combustion chamber of an appliance.
[j]
Light pilots. After the piping has been sufficiently
purged, all appliances shall be purged and the pilots
lighted. The installer shall assure himself that all
piping and appliances are fully purged before leaving
the premises.
[k]
Purging large lines with inert gas. Lines of four-inch
iron pipe size or larger should be purged with carbon
dioxide, nitrogen or a mixture of the two. For a
detailed procedure, consult the gas utility corporation.
[l]
Certificate of inspection.
When the rough piping inspection has been made, if the
installation is found to comply with the provisions of this
code, a certificate of inspection shall be issued by the
Plumbing Inspector to the permit holder.
[1]
A copy of the certificate of such rough piping inspection
shall be issued to the gas utility corporation supplying gas
to the premises.
[2]
It shall be unlawful for any utility or person furnishing
gas to set or cause to be set or connected any gas meter
or meters with any gas piping until such certificate of
inspection, as herein provided, shall have been issued.
[3]
(f)
Authority to connect. It shall be unlawful to turn on or to
connect gas in or on any premises unless all outlets are
properly and securely connected to gas appliances or capped
or plugged with screw-joint fittings.
(g)

to the premises is hereby authorized to turn the gas off or
disconnect any gas piping and/or appliance which shall be
found not to conform to the requirements of this code or
which may be found defective and in such condition as to
endanger life or property.
Where such disconnection has been made, a notice shall
be attached by the gas utility corporation to such gas
piping and/or appliance, which shall state that the same
has been turned off or disconnected, together with the
reasons therefor.
[2]
Such attached notice shall not be removed nor shall the
gas piping and/or appliance be turned on or reconnected
until the defective condition has been corrected.
[3]
It shall be unlawful to remove or disconnect any gas fixture
and/or appliance without capping or plugging with a
screw-joint fitting the outlet from which said gas fixture
and/or appliance was removed.
[4]

are not connected shall be left capped or plugged with
a screw-joint fitting, gastight, on any gas piping system
which has been installed, altered, extended or repaired.
[5]
General precautions.
Turn gas off. All gas piping or gas appliance installations
shall be performed with the gas turned off to eliminate
hazards from leakage of gas.
[1]
Notification of interrupted service. It shall be the duty of
the installing permit holder when the gas supply is to be
turned off to notify all affected consumers.
[2]
Before turning gas off. Before turning off the gas at the
meter for the purpose of installation, repair, replacement
or maintenance of piping or appliances, all burner and
pilot valves on the premises supplied with gas through the
meter shall be turned off and the meter test hand observed
for a sufficient length of time to ascertain that there is no
gas passing through the meter. Where there is more than
one meter on the premises, precaution shall be exercised
to assure that the proper meter is turned off.
[3]
Checking for gas leaks. No matches, candles, flames or
other sources of ignition shall be employed to check for
gas leakage from piping or an appliance. Gas leakage shall
be checked with a soap and water solution. See provisions
of Subsection H(1)(e)[2][c], [f], [g], [h] and [i].

marked by a metal tag or other permanent means
installed by the plumber, designating the part of the
building being supplied.
[b]
Interconnections. Where two or more meters are installed
on the same premises but supply separate consumers, the
piping systems shall not be interconnected on the outlet
side of the meters.
[3]
Size of piping to gas appliances.
Size of piping. Piping shall be of such size and so installed
as to provide a supply of gas sufficient to meet the
maximum demand without undue loss of pressure between
the meter and the appliance or appliances. The size of gas
pipe depends upon the following factors:
[a] Allowable loss in pressure from meter to appliance.
[b] Maximum gas consumption to be provided for.
[c] Length of pipe and number of fittings.
[d] Specific gravity of the gas.
[e] Diversity factor.
[1]
Pressure loss. It is recommended that the pressure loss in
any piping system from the gas meter to any appliance at
the maximum probable gas demand not exceed a threetenths-
inch water column.
[2]
Gas consumption. The volume of gas to be provided for
(in cubic feet per hour) shall be determined, whenever
possible, directly from the manufacturer's Btu ratings of
the appliances which will be installed and the heating
value of the gas to be used. In case the ratings of the
appliances to be installed are not known, Table 27194 is
given to show the approximate consumption of average
appliances of certain types in Btu's per hour.
To obtain the cubic feet per hour of gas required,

run around the sides of the room in the most practical
manner.
[6]
Do not bend pipe. Pipe shall not be bent. Fittings shall be
used when making turns in gas piping.
[7]
Provide drip where necessary. A drip shall be provided
at any point in the line of pipe where condensate may
collect. Where condensation is excessive, a drip shall be
provided at the outlet of the meter. This drip shall be so
installed as to constitute a trap wherein an accumulation
of condensate will shut off the flow of gas before it will run
back into the meter.
[8]
Location and size of drips. All drips shall be installed only
in such locations that they will be readily accessible to
permit cleaning or emptying. A drip shall not be located
where the condensate is likely to freeze. The size of any
drip used shall be determined by the capacity and the
exposure of the piping which drains to it and in accordance
with the recommendations of the gas utility corporation.
[9]

minimum clearance shall be 18 inches.
The clearance from metal flue or vent connectors to
combustible construction may be reduced as specified
in Table 32202 where the combustible construction is
protected in accordance with this table.
[b]
Use of thimbles. Flue or vent connectors, other than Type
B (see Building Code), shall not pass through any
combustible walls or partitions unless they are guarded
at the point of passage by ventilated metal thimbles not
smaller than the following:
For listed appliances except floor furnaces and
incinerators: four inches larger in diameter than the
flue or vent connector, unless there is a run of not
less than six feet of flue or vent connector in the
open, between the draft hood outlet and the thimble,
in which case the thimble may be two inches larger in
diameter than the flue or vent connector.
[a]
For listed floor furnaces and all unlisted appliances
except incinerators: six inches larger in diameter than

incinerator when recommended by the manufacturer.
The manual damper shall be so constructed that it will
not close off more than 80% of the cross-sectional area
of the flue or vent connector. Such a damper will be
supplied with a listed incinerator if the manufacturer
recommends its use, and the installation instructions
accompanying the incinerator will include complete
information for installation of the damper.
Fireplace. A flue or vent connector shall not be connected
to a chimney flue having a fireplace opening unless the
opening is permanently sealed.
[11]
Check chimney. Before connecting a flue or vent
connector, the flue or vent shall be examined to ascertain
that it is properly constructed, clear and will freely
conduct the products of combustion to the outer air.
[12]
Draft woods. Every vented appliance, except incinerators,
dual oven-type combination ranges and units designed for
power burners or for forced venting, shall have a draft
hood. If the draft hood is not a part of the appliance
or supplied by the appliance manufacturer, it shall be
supplied by the installer and, in the absence of other
instructions, shall be the same size as the appliance flue
collar. (For suggested general dimensions for such draft
hoods, see Tables 33, 34 and 35 with accompanying
Figures 18, 19 and 20 respectively.203)
Installation of draft hoods. Where the draft hood is a
part of the appliance or is supplied by the appliance
manufacturer, it shall be installed without alteration
in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. In
the absence of manufacturer's instructions, the draft
hood shall be attached to the flue collar of the
appliance or as near to the appliance as conditions
permit. In no case shall a draft hood be installed in a
false ceiling, in a different room or in any manner that
will permit a difference in pressure between the draft
hood relief opening and the combustion air supply.
[a]
Position of draft hood. A draft hood shall be installed
in the position for which it was designed with
reference to the horizontal and vertical planes and
shall be so located that the relief opening is not
obstructed by any part of the appliance or adjacent
construction.
[b]

§ 242-12 PERFORMANCE BONDS § 242-12
238:619
Special draft hoods. Where the installer must supply a
draft hood of special design, advice of the gas utility
corporation or the proper administrative authority as
to its use should be secured.
[c]
Size. The flue or vent to which the flue or vent connector
is connected shall be of a size not less than specified in
Figure 21.204 In no case shall the area be less than the
area of three-inch diameter pipe. When more than one
appliance vents into a flue or vent, the flue or vent area
shall be not less than the area of the largest flue or vent
connector plus 50% of the areas of the additional flue or
vent connectors. Any shaped flue or vent may be used,
provided that its flue gas venting capacity is equal to the
capacity of round pipe for which it is substituted.
[14]
Height. The flue or vent should extend high enough above
the building or other neighboring obstruction so that wind
from any direction will not strike the flue or vent from
an angle above horizontal. Unless the obstruction is of
great magnitude, it is usual experience that a flue or vent
extended at least two feet above flat roofs or two feet
above the highest part of wall parapets and peaked rods
within 30 feet will be reasonably free from downdrafts.
[15]
Chimney entrance. In entering a chimney flue, the
connection shall be above the extreme bottom to avoid
stoppage. Means shall be employed which will prevent the
flue or vent connector from entering so far as to unduly
restrict the space between its end and the opposite wall
of the chimney. A thimble or slip joint shall be used to
facilitate removal of the flue or vent connector for
cleaning.
[16]
Cleanouts. Cleanouts shall be of such construction that
they will remain tightly closed when not in use.
[17]
Venting into flues used for other fuels. An automatically
controlled gas appliance connected to a flue which also
serves equipment for the combustion of solid or liquid fuel
shall be equipped with an automatic pilot. A gas appliance
flue or vent connector and a smoke pipe from an appliance
burning another fuel may be connected into the same flue
through separate openings or may be connected through a
single opening if joined by a wye fitting located as close as
practical to the flue. If two or more openings are provided
into one flue, they should be at different levels.

63-2003]
An offense against the provisions of this chapter shall be punishable by a
fine of not less than $250 and not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment
for not more than 15 days, or both. Each and every day that a violation
continues shall be a separate and additional violation.
Flue connecting two or more gas appliances. In order to
promote better draft where more than one gas appliance
flue or vent connector is connected to a flue or vent, the
connections should be made at different levels. Two or
more gas appliances may be vented through a common
flue or vent connector when necessary, if joined by wye
fittings as close as practical to the flue or vent, and
provided that the size of the common flue or vent is
sufficient to accommodate the total volume of flue gases.
Wye fittings shall be made so that the angle at which the
flue or vent connectors intersect is as small as possible and
should not exceed 45º.
[19]
Gas shutoff valves.
Accessibility of gas valves. Main gas shutoff valves
controlling several piping systems shall be placed an
adequate distance from each other so that they will be
easily accessible for operation and shall be installed so as
to be protected from injury. Valves shall be plainly marked
with a metal tag by the installer so that the, piping systems
supplied through them can be re identified. Shutoff valves
shall be installed at every point where safety, convenience
of operation and maintenance demands.
[1]
Shutoff valves for multiple house lines. In multiple-tenant
buildings supplied through a master meter or where
meters are not readily accessible from the appliance
location, an individual shutoff valve for each apartment
and for each separate house line shall be provided at a
convenient point of general accessibility.
[2]
Shutoff valve for gas appliance. Every gas appliance shall
have an approved shutoff valve on the supply line.

§ 254-1. Legislative intent.
§ 254-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
PHYSICAL DISPLAY — Shall have the plain and common meaning of those
words. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term shall
include signs, posters, signboards and the like, except those which are
carried by people and not placed on or affixed to the ground (except
momentarily).
Recent court decisions have brought to the City Council's attention the
fact that certain types of physical displays are deemed to be "symbolic
speech" and, as such, are entitled to the same constitutional protections
and safeguards and subject to the same types of regulation as verbal
speech.
A.
Physical displays have characteristics which obviously make them
different in some respects from verbal speech. For example, they are
generally more permanent than a person or group of people who speak
and then move on. Their size can be almost limitless. If not constructed
and erected properly, they can be dangerous. They can attract vandals
and, particularly if placed in parks, children. One cannot tell who is
responsible for their placement and removal without a mechanism for
responsible persons to identify themselves.
B.
Being aware that certain physical displays on public property are
entitled to the same protections as verbal speech and also being aware
that physical displays are different from verbal speech in some
respects, the City Council believes that it is in the best interest of
the City to have a stated set of rules regarding such displays which
can be applied evenhandedly, which will encourage and provide for
dissemination of ideas on public property in a manner consistent with
the other uses made of the property and which will maximize the public
health, safety and welfare.
C.
§ 253-2 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 254-2
254:628
PRIVATE PROPERTY — Any person, corporation, partnership, firm or other
entity, except the City of New Rochelle and its various boards, commissions,
committees, departments and agencies.
PUBLIC PROPERTY — All streets, highways and sidewalks within the City
of New Rochelle, whether public or private, and all other lands owned by or
dedicated to the City of New Rochelle.
§ 254-3. Displays on streets and sidewalks.
Except as otherwise specifically provided by local law, either heretofore
or hereinafter enacted, no physical displays may be erected, placed or
maintained on any street or sidewalk within the City of New Rochelle
by private parties, except those permitted sales by merchants allowed by
permit.
§ 254-4. Displays on public property.
Physical displays may be placed on public property under the following
terms and conditions:
No physical displays containing commercial advertising, soliciting
funds or advertising any event, whether by a profit or nonprofit
organization, shall be permitted.
A.
The foregoing permission is hereby specifically conditioned upon
compliance with all provisions of the Fire Prevention Code, Building
Code, Zoning Ordinance208 and all other applicable laws, ordinances or
regulations as well as the posting of a surety bond with reference to the
prompt removal of the structure upon expiration of the permit.
B.
Physical displays shall be permitted in the locations shown in Appendix
A to this chapter.209
C.
Application and permit.
Any private party wishing to place a display in one of the permitted
locations shall submit an application to the City Clerk in the form
shown in Appendix B to this chapter210 containing the information
requested thereon. The description of the display and the
accompanying sketch or plan shall be sufficiently detailed for the
Building Official to determine the structural integrity of the
proposed display and how it will be anchored to the ground, if at
all. The application shall be submitted at least 30 days prior to the
first date the applicant is requesting to place the display on public
property.

§ 254-2 PUBLIC DISPLAYS § 254-4
254:629
§ 254-5. Penalties for offenses.
Upon receipt of the application, the City Clerk shall forward a
copy thereof to the Building Official. The Building Official shall
then examine the description of the proposed display in order
to determine whether the proposed display will be structurally
sound and sufficiently anchored.
(a)
If the Building Official requires further information from the
applicant to make the required determination, he may request
the necessary information from the applicant, who shall supply
it within five days of the request.
(b)
Within 15 days of receipt of all necessary information, the
Building Official shall advise the City Clerk whether the
proposed display, as described to him, appears to be
structurally sound for its purpose and properly anchored. If
the Building Official finds the display will not be structurally
sound or properly anchored or if insufficient information has
been submitted to him, no permit shall issue.
(c)
If the Building Official issues a positive determination, the City
Clerk shall issue a permit upon the filing of an agreement by
the applicant to defend, indemnify and hold the City harmless
in connection with the display, in the form attached hereto as
Appendix C,211 and an insurance certificate naming the City of
New Rochelle as coinsured in connection with the display, with
liability limits as set by the City Council from time to time.
(d)
Each display shall be accompanied by a sign prominently placed and
readable by passersby containing letters of at least one inch, stating by
whom the display has been erected and further stating that the person
or organization is a private party or organization, not the City of New
Rochelle.
E.
Each display shall be erected in accordance with the description
submitted to the Building Department as described above.
F.
No display shall remain in place for more than five weeks, and the
applicant shall remove it and restore the property to the condition
it was in prior to its erection within said five weeks of its original
placement on the site.
G.
Any utilities used in connection with any display shall be paid for by the
applicant.
H.
Any person, firm, corporation or other entity who violates this chapter
shall be subject to a fine of up to $250 per violation.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 257-1. Legislative declaration; purpose.
The Council of the City of New Rochelle finds that nuisances, in the form
of property and building nuisances ("nuisance"), exist in the City of New
Rochelle in the operation of certain commercial establishments and the
use or alteration of property in violation of the Building Code, Zoning
Ordinance, health laws, Multiple Dwelling Law, penal laws regulating
obscenity, prostitution and related conduct, licensing laws, environmental
laws, laws relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, laws
relating to gambling, controlled substances and dangerous drugs and penal
laws relating to the possession of stolen property, all of which interfere
with the interest of the public in the quality of life and total community
environment, the tone of commerce in the City, property values and the
public health, safety and welfare. The Council further finds that the
continued occurrence of such activities and violations is detrimental to
the health, safety and welfare of the people of the City of New Rochelle
and to the businesses thereof and visitors thereto. It is the purpose of
the Council to create one standardized procedure for securing legal and
equitable remedies and reform relating to the subject matter encompassed
by this chapter, without prejudice to the use of procedures available under
existing and subsequently enacted laws, and to strengthen existing laws on
the subject.
§ 257-2. Short title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Property and Building Nuisance Reform
Act."
§ 257-3. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CONVICTION — The entry of a plea of guilty to or a verdict of guilty upon
an accusatory instrument other than a felony complaint or to one or more
counts of such instrument.
CRIMINAL NUISANCE — A person is guilty of criminal nuisance in the
second degree when, by conduct either unlawful in itself or unreasonable
under all the circumstances, he knowingly or recklessly creates or
maintains a condition which endangers the safety or health of a
considerable number of persons or he knowingly conducts or maintains any
premises, place or resort where persons gather for purposes of engaging
in unlawful conduct. "Criminal nuisance" in the second degree is a Class B
misdemeanor.
MATERIAL — Anything tangible which is capable of being used or adopted
to arouse interest, whether through the medium of reading, observation,
sound or in any other manner.
§ 257-1 PUBLIC EXPRESSMEN § 257-3
255:633
OBSCENE — Any material or performance is "obscene" if the average
person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that,
considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to the prurient interest
in sex and it depicts or describes in a patently offensive manner actual
or simulated sexual intercourse, sodomy, sexual bestiality, masturbation,
sadism, masochism, excretion or lewd exhibition of the genitals and,
considered as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political and
scientific value. Predominant appeal shall be judged with reference to
ordinary adults unless it appears from the character of the material or
the circumstances of its dissemination to be designed for children or other
specially susceptible audience.
OFFENSES — Conduct for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment or
to a fine is provided by any law of this state or by any law, local law or
ordinance of a political subdivision of this state or by any order, rule or
regulation of any governmental instrumentality authorized by law to adopt
the same.

performed before an audience.

be competent evidence to prove the existence of a property or
building nuisance.
(2)

or place or of the inhabitants or occupants thereof is sufficient

evidence of knowledge thereof and acquiescence and participation
therein and responsibility for the nuisance on the part of the
owners, lessors, lessees and all those in possession of or having
charge of, as agent or otherwise, or having any interest in any form

Local Charges Tax Lien Appeals Board
[Adopted 3-16-1999 by L.L. No. 2-1999]
§ 288-22. Purpose.
The City Council of the City of New Rochelle recognizes that, in certain
limited situations involving lack of knowledge and prior notice, justification
may exist for the cancellation of certain tax liens assessed against real
property in the City of New Rochelle which derive from unpaid City charges
for abatement of certain property conditions and unpaid City fees and
charges for false alarms as authorized under Sections 197 (sidewalks),
197-A (abandoned excavations) and 200 (property maintenance, abatement
and tax liens) of the City Charter and under §§ 81-16 (alarm systems, tax
lien for unpaid fees and charges), 111-20 (unsafe buildings) and 281-21
(streets and sidewalks, abandoned excavations) of the City Code. Pursuant
to the home rule powers of the City set forth in the Municipal Home
Rule Law, the City Council desires to create an appeals board to hear
and determine applications for the cancellation of such tax liens for local
charges and fees (hereinafter "local charges").
§ 288-23. Composition.
The Local Charges Tax Lien Appeals Board shall consist of three members
as follows: the City Manager or the City Manager's designee, the Finance
Commissioner or the Finance Commissioner's designee, and the director of
the department from which the unpaid local charges originated.
§ 288-24. Powers; requirements for cancellation of local charges tax
lien.
The Local Charges Tax Lien Appeals Board shall have the power to hear and
determine applications from property owners seeking cancellation of tax
liens for unpaid local charges. The Local Charges Tax Lien Appeals Board
may cancel a tax lien for unpaid Local Charges only upon a showing by
the current property owner and a finding by the Board that the property
owner at the time the tax lien for such unpaid local charges attached to the
property had neither knowledge of nor had received prior notice of the local
charges.
§ 288-25. Collection proceeding upon cancellation of local charges
tax lien.
In the event that the Local Charges Tax Lien Appeals Board cancels a local
charges tax lien pursuant to this article, the Corporation Counsel may bring
a proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to collect the unpaid local
charges from the person or entity who owned the real property at the time
notice of the local charges was first given by the City to such property
owner.

shall pay to the City Commissioner of Finance the taxes imposed by this
article upon the rents required to be included in such return, as well as all
other monies collected by the operator acting or purporting to act under the
provisions of this article; even though it be judicially determined that the
tax collected is invalidly required to be filed, shall be due from the operator
and payable to the City Commissioner of Finance on the date prescribed
herein for the filing of the return for such period, without regard to whether
a return is filed or whether the return which is filed correctly shows the
amount of rents and taxes due thereon. Where the City Commissioner of
Finance in his/her discretion deems it necessary to protect revenues to be
obtained under this article, he/she may require any operator required to
collect the tax imposed by this article to file with him/her a bond, issued
by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and
approved by the Superintendent of Insurance of this state as to solvency
and responsibility, in such amount as the City Commissioner of Finance
may find to secure the payment of any tax and/or penalties and interest
due or which may become due from such operator. In the event that the
City Commissioner of Finance determines that an operator is to file such
bonds, he/she shall give notice to such operator to that effect, specifying
the amount of the bond required. The operator shall file such bond within
five days after the giving of such notice unless, within such five days, the
operator shall request in writing a hearing before the City Commissioner
of Finance at which the necessity, propriety and amount of the bond shall
be determined by the City Commissioner of Finance. Such determination
shall be final and shall be complied with within 15 days after the giving
of notices thereof. In lieu of such bond, securities approved by the City
Commissioner of Finance or cash in such amount as he/she may prescribe
may be deposited with him/her, which shall be kept in the custody of the
City Commissioner of Finance, who may at any time, without notice to the
City Commissioner of Finance deems it necessary in order to ensure the
payment of the tax imposed by this article, he/she may require returns
to be made for shorter periods than those prescribed pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this section and upon such dates as he/she may
specify.
The forms of return shall be prescribed by the City Commissioner
of Finance and shall contain such information as he/she may deem
necessary for the proper administration of this article. The City
Commissioner of Finance may require amended returns to be filed
within 20 days after notice and to contain the information specified in
the notice.
B.
If a return required by this article is not filed, or if a return is
incorrectly filed or is insufficient on its face, the City Commissioner of
Finance shall take such steps as he/she deems necessary to enforce the
filing of such return or of a corrected return.

that purpose the securities may be sold by him/her at public or private sale
without notice to the depositor thereof.
§ 288-43. Determination of tax.
If a return required by this article is not filed or if a return, when filed, is
incorrect or insufficient, the amount of tax due shall be determined by the
City Commissioner of Finance from such information as may be obtainable,
and, if necessary, the tax may be estimated on the basis of external indices,
such as number of rooms, locations, scale of rents, comparable rents,
type of accommodations and service, number of employees and/or other
factors. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable
for the collection and/or payment of the tax. Such determination shall
finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is
assessed, within 30 days after giving notice of such determination, shall
apply to the City Commissioner of Finance for a hearing or unless the
City Commissioner of Finance on his/her own motion shall redetermine
the same. After such hearing, the City Commissioner of Finance shall give
notice of his/her determination to the person against whom the tax is
assessed. The determination of the City Commissioner of Finance shall be
reviewable for error, illegality, unconstitutionality or any other recognizable
basis whatsoever by proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules if application therefor is made to the Supreme Court within 30
days after the giving of the notice of such determination. A proceeding
under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules shall not be instituted
unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and
interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the City Commissioner
of Finance and there shall be filed with the City Commissioner of Finance
an undertaking, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business
in this state and approved by the Superintendent of Insurance of this
state as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a Justice of the
Supreme Court shall approve to the effect that, if such proceedings be
dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges
which may accrue, including reasonable counsel fees, in the prosecution
of the proceeding, or, at the option of the applicant, such undertaking
filed with the City Commissioner of Finance may be in a sum sufficient to
cover the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in such determination
plus the costs and charges, including reasonable counsel fees, which may
accrue against it in the prosecution of the proceedings, in which event the
applicant shall not be required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest
as a condition precedent to the application.
§ 288-44. Disposition of revenues.
All revenue resulting from the imposition of the tax under this article shall
be paid into the treasury of the City and shall be credited to and deposited
in the general fund of the City.
§ 288-45. Refunds.
§ 288-42 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 288-45
264:802
In the manner provided in this section, the City Commissioner of
Finance shall refund or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or
interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid if
application to the City Commissioner of Finance for such refund shall
be made within one year from the payment thereof. Whenever a refund
is made by the City Commissioner of Finance, he/she shall state his/
her reason therefor in writing. Such application may be made by the
occupant, operator or other person who has actually paid the tax.
Such application may also be made by an operator who has collected
and paid over such tax to the City Commissioner of Finance, provided
that the application is made within one year of the payment by the
occupant to the operator, but no actual refund of monies shall be made
to such operator until he/she shall first establish to the satisfaction of
the City Commissioner of Finance, under such regulations as the City
Commissioner of Finance may prescribe, that he/she has repaid to the
occupant the amount for which the application for refund is made. The
City Commissioner of Finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be
made, allow credit therefor on payments due or to become due from the
applicant.
A.
An application for a refund or credit made as herein provided shall
be deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest
complained of, and the City Commissioner of Finance may receive
evidence with respect thereto. After making his/her determination, the
City Commissioner of Finance shall give notice thereof to the applicant,
who shall be entitled to review such determination by a proceeding
pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, provided
that such proceeding is instituted within 30 days after the giving of the
notice of such determination, and provided that a final determination
of tax due was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be

The planting and maintenance of trees have a direct relationship to the
health, safety and welfare of the community as trees provide shade, reduce
the need for air conditioning, absorb air pollution and provide oxygen;
stabilize soil and reduce erosion and flooding; offer a natural barrier to
noise and add to the aesthetic quality of the community. The indiscriminate
and excessive cutting of trees for the creation of subdivisions and
residential and nonresidential development on private lots causes barren
and unsightly conditions, increases surface drainage problems and reduces
property values, all of which adversely affect the inhabitants of the City of
New Rochelle.

shall, upon entering said parking space, immediately deposit in the
parking meter alongside of or next to said parking space the required
fee in coin of the United States as the case may be for parking and

parked displays an overtime signal, shall be prima facie evidence that
such vehicle is parked in violation.

remain parked in any parking space alongside of or next to which any
parking meter is placed while said meter is displaying a signal showing

fixed by this chapter or any other ordinance of the City for such parking
space.

pay station on the same day.310 [Amended 1-17-1995 by Ord. No.

TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL PHOTO VIOLATION
MONITORING SYSTEM
GENERAL REFERENCES
Vehicles and traffic — See Ch. 312.
§ 313-1. Owner liability for failure of operator to comply with traffic
control indications.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the City of New Rochelle
is hereby authorized and empowered to establish a demonstration
program imposing monetary liability on the owner of a vehicle for
failure of an operator thereof to comply with traffic control indications
in accordance with the provisions of this section. The Police
Department and the Traffic Engineer, for purposes of implementation
of such program, shall be authorized to install and operate traffic
control signal photo violation monitoring devices at no more than 12
intersections at any one time.
A.
Such demonstration program shall utilize necessary technologies to
ensure, to the extent practicable, that photographs produced by such
traffic control signal photo violation monitoring system shall not include
images that identify the driver, the passengers or the contents of the
vehicle; provided, however, that no notice of liability issued pursuant
to this section shall be dismissed solely because a photograph or
photographs allow for the identification of the contents of the vehicle,
provided that the City of New Rochelle has made a reasonable effort to
comply with the provisions of this subsection.
B.
The owner of a vehicle shall be liable for a penalty imposed pursuant to
this section if such vehicle was used or operated with the permission of
the owner, express or implied, in violation of Subdivision (d) of § 1111
of the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law and such violation is
evidenced by information obtained from the traffic control signal photo
violation monitoring system.
C.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no owner of a
vehicle shall be subject to a monetary fine imposed pursuant to this
section if the operator of such vehicle was operating such vehicle
without the consent of the owner at the time such operator failed to
obey a traffic control indication. For purposes of this subsection, there
shall be a presumption that the operator of such vehicle was operating
such vehicle with the consent of the owner at the time such operator
failed to obey a traffic control indication.
D.
§ 312-100 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 313-1
264:1130
For purposes of this section, "owner" shall mean any person,
corporation, partnership, firm, agency, association, lessor or
organization who at the time of the issuance of a notice of violation in
which such vehicle is operated:
(1) Is the beneficial or equitable of such vehicle; or
(2) Has title to such vehicle; or
Is the registrant or co-registrant of such vehicle which is registered
with the Department of Motor Vehicles of the State of New York
or any other state, territory, district, province, nation or other
jurisdiction; or
(3)
(4) Uses such vehicle in its vehicle-renting and/or leasing business; or
Is an owner of such vehicle as defined by § 128 or Subdivision (a)
of § 2101 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.
(5)
E.
For purposes of this section, "traffic control signal photo violationmonitoring
system" shall mean a device installed to work in conjunction
with a traffic control signal which, during operation, automatically
produces two or more photographs, two or more microphotographs, a
videotape or other recorded images of each vehicle at the time it is used
or operated in violation of Subdivision (d) of § 1111 of the Vehicle and
Traffic Law.
F.
A certificate, sworn to or affirmed by a technician employed, hired
or contracted by the City of New Rochelle, or a facsimile thereof,
based upon inspection of photographs, microphotographs, videotape
or other recorded images produced by a traffic control signal photo
violation-monitoring system, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts
contained therein. Any photographs, microphotographs, videotape or
other recorded images evidencing such a violation shall be available for
inspection in any proceeding to adjudicate the liability of such violation
imposed pursuant to this section.
G.
An owner liable for a violation of Subdivision (d) of § 1111 of the
Vehicle and Traffic Law pursuant to this section shall be liable for a
monetary penalty of $50 for each violation. An owner shall be liable for
an additional penalty of $25 for each violation for the failure to respond
to a notice of liability within the prescribed time period. City Court
of the City of New Rochelle shall adjudicate liability imposed by this
section.
H.
An imposition of liability under this section shall not be deemed a
conviction as an operator and shall not be made part of the operating
record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed nor shall it be
used for insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance
coverage.
I.
§ 313-1 SECONDHAND ARTICLES AND VEHICLES § 313-1
264:1131
A notice of liability shall be sent by first-class mail to each person
alleged to be liable as an owner for a violation of Subdivision (d) of
§ 1111 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law pursuant to this section. Personal
service on the owner shall not be required. A manual or automatic
record of mailing prepared in the ordinary course of business shall be
prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein.
J.
A notice of liability shall contain the name and address of the person
alleged to be liable as an owner for a violation of Subdivision (d)
of § 1111 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law pursuant to this section,
the registration number of the vehicle involved in such violation, the
location where such violation took place, the date and time of such
violation and the identification number of the camera which recorded
the violation or other document locator number.
K.
The notice of liability shall contain information advising the person
charged of the manner and the time in which he or she may contest the
liability alleged in the notice. Such notice of liability shall also contain
a warning to advise the persons charged that failure to contest in the
manner and time provided shall be deemed an admission of liability and
that a default judgment may be entered thereon.
L.
The notice of liability shall be prepared and mailed by the City of New
Rochelle or by any other entity authorized to do so by the City.
M.
If an owner receives a notice of liability pursuant to this section for
any time period during which the vehicle is reported to the Police
Department as having been stolen, it shall be a valid defense to an
allegation of liability for a violation of Subdivision (d) of § 1111 of the
Vehicle and Traffic Law pursuant to this section that the vehicle had
been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time the violation
occurred and had not been recovered by such time. For the purposes of
asserting the defense provided by this subsection, it shall be sufficient
that a certified copy of the police report on the stolen vehicle be sent by
first-class mail, return receipt requested, to the City Court, City of New
Rochelle.
N.
If the owner liable for a violation of Subdivision (d) of § 1111 of the
Vehicle and Traffic Law pursuant to this section was not the operator
of the vehicle at the time of the violation, the owner may maintain an
action for indemnification against the operator.

Feeding Prohibited
[Adopted 9-20-2016 by Ord. No. 180-2016320]
§ 319-1. Findings; purpose.
§ 319-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
FEEDING — The feeding of wildlife shall mean the placing of any food
substances on public property within 100 feet of any wildlife.
WILDLIFE — Shall include any animal which is not normally domesticated
in the State of New York, including but not limited to coyotes, deer, turkeys,
feral cats, foxes, raccoons, skunks, and birds, inclusive of waterfowl and
pigeons.
§ 319-3. Prohibitions.
It shall be unlawful for any person to feed, provide food, or assist another
person in the feeding of wildlife defined herein in, from, or upon any park
or public property. No person shall purposely or knowingly leave or store
any refuse, garbage, food product, pet food, forage product or supplement,
salt, seed, birdseed, fruit or grain in a manner that would constitute an
attractant to any wildlife as defined herein.
The City Council finds that the feeding of wildlife in public areas
can cause harm to both people and animals. Wildlife can carry many
diseases that readily spread to people, pets and livestock. These
diseases include rabies, Lyme disease, salmonellosis, Rocky Mountain
spotted fever, tularemia, distemper and encephalitis. In addition, most
wildlife species carry parasites that are also easily transferred to
humans. For example, raccoon round worms can be fatal to humans,
and scabies mites cause mange in pets. Moreover, though wildlife may
accept food from people, they will likely not get the balanced diet they
need for good health. Animals that are fed by humans often lose their
natural fear of people, and any wild animal, no matter how timid, is
capable of inflicting injury to humans, pets and livestock.
A.
The City Council finds, based upon extensive investigation, that feeding
wildlife in public areas adversely affects the health, safety and welfare
of the residents of the City of New Rochelle.
B.

Consistency Review Law."
§ 320-2. Statutory authority; purpose and intent; applicability,
purpose.
This chapter is adopted under the authority of the Municipal Home
Rule Law and the Waterfront Revitalization of Coastal Areas and Inland
Waterways Act of the State of New York (Article 42 of the Executive
Law).
A.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a framework for the agencies
of the City of New Rochelle to consider the policies and purposes
contained in the City of New Rochelle Local Waterfront Revitalization
Program (LWRP) when reviewing applications for actions or direct
agency actions located in the waterfront area; and to assure that such
actions and direct actions are consistent with the said LWRP policies
and purposes.
B.
It is the intention of the City of New Rochelle that the preservation,
enhancement and utilization of the unique waterfront area of the City of
New Rochelle take place in a coordinated and comprehensive manner
to ensure a proper balance between protection of natural resources
and the need to accommodate limited population growth and economic
development. Accordingly, this chapter is intended to achieve such a
balance, permitting the beneficial use of waterfront resources while
preventing: loss and degradation of living waterfront resources and
wildlife; diminution of open space areas or public access to the
waterfront; disruption of natural waterfront processes; impairment of
scenic, cultural or historical resources; losses due to flooding, erosion
and sedimentation; impairment of water quality; or permanent adverse
changes to ecological systems.
C.
The substantive provisions of this chapter shall only apply while there
is in existence a City of New Rochelle Local Waterfront Revitalization
Program, which has been adopted in accordance with Article 42 of the
Executive Law of the State of New York.

between the building wall and the property line; however, in no case shall
any part of any construction encroach upon the rear yard required by the
Schedule of District Regulations for the district by more than 10%.
YARD, SIDE — An open unoccupied space between the side lot line drawn
parallel thereto at such distance therefrom as may be specified herein
for any district. In the case of a building located on a nonrectangular or
irregularly shaped lot, the yard provided shall be the average dimension

§ 331-6. Naming of districts.
§ 331-7. Zoning Map. [Amended 5-19-2005 by Ord. No. 120-2005]
The boundaries of all districts are hereby established as shown on a map
entitled "Zoning Map, City of New Rochelle, New York," dated May 19,
2005, as it may be amended from time to time with ordinance numbers and
ordinance adoption dates shown on such Map, which Map accompanies and,
with all explanatory matter thereon, is made part of this chapter. The official
copy of this Map shall be kept by the Building Official and amendments
thereto shall be reviewed for accuracy by the Building Official, with copies
made available to the public by the City Clerk. Whenever the City Council
amends the Zoning Map, the City Clerk shall notify the Building Official,
who shall cause the amendment to be made to the official Zoning Map.
§ 331-8. Interpretation of district boundaries.
Where uncertainty exists as to the locations of any boundaries shown on the
Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
The titles of the districts have been created to be as informational
as possible. For example, in the case of the R1-20 District, the "R"
refers to Residence, the "1" refers to one-family, and the "20" refers
to the minimum required lot area of 20,000 square feet. In multifamily
residence districts, the maximum permitted floor area ratio (FAR) is the
descriptive term used to indicate the differing characteristics among
districts. For example in the case of the RMF-0.4 District, the "RMF"
refers to multifamily residence and the "0.4" represents the floor area
ratio regulation which is used to control the density of development.
The numbering following the Planned Waterfront Development District
name refers to the height of the structure in stories.
A.
For nonresidence districts the classifications reflect the character of
existing development, such as Downtown Mixed-Use (DMU) and the
Downtown Mixed Use Urban Renewal (DMUR) District. [Amended
12-11-2007 by Ord. No. 294-2007]
B.
District boundary lines follow lot lines, streets, municipal boundaries,
rights-of-way, railroad rights-of-way or watercourses, or are parallel or
perpendicular thereto, unless such district boundary lines are fixed by
dimensions, as shown on the Zoning Map.
A.
Where district boundaries are shown approximately following streets,
rights-of-way, railroad rights-of-way or watercourses, the center lines
thereof shall be such boundaries.
B.
Where district boundaries are shown approximately following
municipal boundaries or lot lines, such municipal boundaries or lot lines
shall be the district boundaries.
C.
§ 331-6 WINDOW CLEANERS § 331-8
325:1199
§ 331-9. Order of restrictiveness.
Where zoning districts are referred to as more restrictive or less restrictive,
the designations shall refer to the order in which the districts are named in
§ 331-5, the first named being the most restrictive.
§ 331-10. Lots in more than one district or municipality.
Where a lot in one ownership of record is divided by one or more district
boundary lines, the following shall apply:
Where district boundary lines divide a lot, the location of any such
boundary, if not indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by use of
the map scale appearing thereon.
D.
If the district classification of any property is in question, it shall be
deemed to be in the most restrictive adjoining district.
E.
In all cases where a district boundary is located not farther than 15 feet
from a lot line of record, the boundary shall be construed to coincide
with such line. In all other cases, where not dimensioned, the location
of boundaries shown on the map shall be determined by the use of the
scale appearing thereon.
F.
Uses permitted in one district may not extend into another district
where they would not otherwise be permitted.
A.
Dimensional requirements shall be measured from the lot lines and not
zoning district lines.

ARTICLE IV
General District Regulations
§ 331-11. Application of regulations.
§ 331-12. Nonconformities.
Conformity required. No building shall be erected, constructed, moved,
altered, rebuilt, or enlarged, nor shall any land, water or building
be used, designed or arranged to be used for any purpose except in
conformity with this chapter.
A.
Minimum requirements. In interpreting and applying this chapter, the
requirements contained herein are declared to be the minimum
requirements necessary for the protection and promotion of the public,
safety, morals, comfort, convenience and general welfare.
B.
Contravention. Any building or parcel of land found at any time to
contravene the specific provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to
be in violation thereof, except in cases where such contravention is
justified either:
By reason of conditions found to have existed prior to the effective
date of this chapter; or
(1)
By the granting of a variance by the Board of Appeals on Zoning, as
hereinafter provided, followed by the effective date of this chapter;
provided, however, that such contravention conforms to the
provisions and special requirements, if any, under which such
variance was granted.
(2)
C.
Continuing existing uses, buildings and structures.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the lawfully permitted use of
lands or buildings and the lawfully permitted existence of buildings
and structures at the time of adoption of this chapter may be
continued although such use, building or structure does not
conform to the standards specified in this chapter for the district
in which such lands, buildings or structures are located. Similarly,
whenever a zoning classification or the restrictions affecting
property within a district shall be changed hereafter so as to render
nonconforming a use, building or structure then presently lawfully
existing, such use, building or structure may nevertheless continue
subject to the conditions set forth below. Said uses shall be deemed
nonconforming uses and said buildings and structures shall be
deemed dimensionally nonconforming.
(1)
Any use in existence as of the effective date of this chapter which
is by this chapter made a special permit use in the district in which
it is located shall be presumed to have a special permit to the
extent such use is legally conforming as of the effective date of this
chapter.
(2)
A.
§ 331-11 WINDOW CLEANERS § 331-12
325:1201
Nonconforming use of land, buildings or structures.
The nonconforming use of land may be continued; provided,
however, that no such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or
intensified, nor shall it be extended to occupy a greater area or
volume of land than that occupied by such use at the time of
the adoption of this chapter, nor shall the lot area be reduced,
unless specifically allowed by other provisions in this chapter, nor
shall any such nonconforming use be moved in whole or in part
to any other portion of the lot or parcel of land occupied by such
nonconforming use at the time of the adoption of this chapter.
(1)
A building or structure, the use of which does not conform with the
use regulations for the district in which it is situated, shall not be
enlarged, extended or altered structurally or by volume of space
unless the use therein is changed to a conforming use, or except
to conform to an order of the Building Official to either correct an
unsafe condition or to conform with the requirements of applicable
laws or ordinances.
(2)
No nonconforming use of a building or structure shall be enlarged
or extended, except that any such nonconforming use may be
extended throughout any parts of the building or structure which
were obviously or manifestly arranged or designed only for such
use at the time of the adoption or amendment of this chapter.
(3)
No nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming
use, except as provided in Subsection E.
(4)
If a nonconforming use ceases for any reason for a period of one
year, or is changed to a conforming use, any future use of the
land, building, air space above or structure shall be in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter. Substantial discontinuance of
activities consistent with or required for the operation of such
nonconforming use or substantial vacancy of the building or
structure in which the nonconforming use was conducted, together
with substantial discontinuance of activities consistent with or
required for the operation of such nonconforming use, shall be
deemed to constitute a cessation thereof within the meaning of
this chapter, irrespective of whether an intention to abandon the
nonconforming use may exist. On application, however, the Board
of Appeals on Zoning may extend the period upon finding that it is
not reasonable in its application to the particular premises, taking
into consideration the characteristics of the use, the investment
which has been made in it, the circumstances of the discontinuance
and the suitability of the structure for a permitted or special permit
use.
(5)
If any building or structure in which any nonconforming use is
conducted or maintained is hereafter removed, the subsequent use
of the land on which such building or structure was located and
(6)
B.
§ 331-12 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 331-12
325:1202
the subsequent use of any building or structure thereon shall be
in conformity with the standards specified by this chapter for the
district in which such land is located.
Dimensional nonconformity. A residential building, in a residential zone,
which is dimensionally nonconforming by reasons of density criteria,
may be structurally altered or enlarged, provided that the aforesaid
construction does not propose any new nonconforming features. A
one- and two-family residential building, in a residential zone, which
is dimensionally nonconforming by reason of side yards, may be
structurally altered or enlarged within the required side yard, provided
that the aforesaid construction does not encroach upon the required
front or rear yards except that in all cases, a minimum side yard of no
less than six feet shall be maintained. An existing one-family residential
building in a one-family residential district, which is nonconforming by
reason of lot area or frontage, may be structurally altered or enlarged,
provided that the aforesaid construction does not encroach upon any
required front, rear, or side yard. These provisions shall not apply to
accessory uses. [Amended 5-19-2005 by Ord. No. 120-2005]
C.
Reconstruction.
Should a building or structure, other than a one-family residential
building in a residential zone, the use of which or the use of
a portion of which is nonconforming, or which is dimensionally
nonconforming, be destroyed or damaged by any means to an
extent greater than 50% of the replacement cost of the entire
building or structure used in connection therewith at the time of
the reconstruction, it shall not thereafter be reconstructed or used
except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. [Amended
5-19-2005 by Ord. No. 120-2005]
(1)
Should a building or structure, the use of which or the use of
a portion of which is nonconforming or which is dimensionally
nonconforming, be destroyed or damaged by any means to an
extent of 50% or less of the replacement cost of the entire building
or structure used in connection therewith at the time of the
reconstruction, it may be reconstructed and any accompanying
nonconforming use continued, provided that the reconstruction
is commenced within one year of the date of such damage and
completed within two years of said date, and further provided that
it shall be reconstructed in accordance with a plan approved by the
Board of Appeals on Zoning via a special permit so as to result,
where reasonable, in greater conformity with this chapter.
(2)
An existing garage accessory to a one- or two-family dwelling may
be replaced in the same dimensions as the original structure and in
accordance with a plan submitted to and approved by the Building
Official. If a nonconforming garage is demolished by order of the
Building Official, such garage may be reconstructed at any time
in the same footprint and dimensions as the original structure.
(3)
D.
§ 331-12 WINDOW CLEANERS § 331-12
325:1203
§ 331-13. Provisions governing lots.
Any change of lot line, whether in conjunction with the creation of a street
or a new lot, or a simple exchange of land, shall be considered to be a
subdivision and shall be subject to Planning Board review and approval per
Chapter A361. A plat indicating such change shall be filed with the Office
of the Westchester County Clerk prior to such change taking effect. A copy
of the filed plat shall also be submitted to the City Assessor. No building
permit shall be issued for the use or development of any lot which has not
been so created subsequent to the effective date of this chapter.
[Added 7-19-2011 by Ord. No. 135-2011; amended 2-19-2013
by Ord. No. 39-2013]
Change to other nonconforming use. On application, any
nonconforming use of land, buildings or structures may be changed to
another nonconforming use upon approval by the Board of Appeals on
Zoning, based upon a finding that the proposed use is more consistent
with the character of the surrounding neighborhood and having less
adverse impacts. In permitting such change, the Board of Appeals on
Zoning may impose such conditions and safeguards as it may deem
necessary or appropriate to further the purposes of this chapter.
E.
Improvement of nonconforming uses. In order that nonconforming uses
may gradually be brought into greater conformity with this chapter
and the adverse external effects of such uses may be reduced, the
owner of the land, building or structure so used may be permitted to
make limited changes to such building, structure or use in conjunction
with a site plan whereby through landscaped screening and buffer
areas, control of noise, smoke, odors, lighting, architectural changes,
location and layout of parking lots and access drives, or by any other
appropriate means, these purposes may be achieved. Such plan shall
be presented to the Board of Appeals on Zoning which may then grant
approval or approval with modifications, provided said Board finds that
the purposes of this section would be advanced by such action.
F.
Lot for every building. Every building hereafter erected shall be located
on a lot and there shall be no more than one principal building and its
accessory buildings on one lot except for multifamily and nonresidential
buildings in districts where such uses are permitted.
A.
Subdivision of a lot. Where a lot is formed hereafter from part of a lot
already occupied by a building, such separation shall be effected in a
manner which will not impair conformity with any of the requirements
of this chapter with respect to the existing building and all yards and
other required spaces in connection therewith. No permit shall be
issued for the erection of a building on the new lot thus created unless it
complies with all the provisions of this chapter. All subdivisions and/or
apportionments shall be submitted to the Planning Board per Chapter
A361 of the City Code.
B.
§ 331-12 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 331-13
325:1204
New building on lots smaller than required. A building permit may
be issued for the erection of a one-family residential building on a lot
in a one-family residential district which was located in the R1-7.5 or
the R1-10 District prior to May 19, 2005, notwithstanding that the lot
frontage or lot area of such lot is less than that required for the district
in which such lot is located at the time of issuance of the building
permit, provided that 1) such lot met the lot frontage and lot area
requirements in effect for such lot in the R1-7.5 or R1-10 District, as
the case may be, prior to May 19, 2005, and 2) such lot was in different
ownership than any other lot or lots contiguous thereto on May 19,
2005, and still is in different ownership as of the date of issuance of the
building permit. In addition, a permit may be issued for the erection of
a building for a permitted use on a lot for which a valid conveyance has
been recorded prior to April 18, 1955, notwithstanding that the area
or dimensions of such lot are less than that required for the district
in which such lot is located, provided that: [Amended 5-19-2005 by
Ord. No. 120-2005]
The lot met the zoning requirements at the time the deed to the lot
was created.
(1)
All yard setbacks and other building related requirements which
are in effect at the time of the obtaining of the building permit
are complied with; provided, however, that in a one- or two-family
residence district, the permitted floor area ratio may be increased
to allow the construction of a dwelling which meets the minimum
floor area requirement of the district in which it is located or so
much thereof as may be possible within the limits of the required
yard setbacks.
(2)
The ownership of such lot was not the same as any other lot
or lots contiguous thereto on April 18, 1955, and still is not the
same as of the date of issuance of the building permit. If that
is not the case, such other lot or lots, or so much thereof as
may be necessary, shall be combined with the first-named lot to
make one or more conforming lots, whereupon a permit may be
issued, but only for such combined lots. Where the required area or
dimensions of lots are changed by an amendment to this chapter,
any lot legally in existence on that date and made nonconforming
by such amendment may be built upon as provided in this section.
(3)
The lot is shown on a subdivision plat filed in the Westchester
County Clerk's Office. [Added 5-13-2008 by Ord. No. 108-2008;
amended 10-16-2012 by Ord. No. 171-2012]
(4)
C.
Minimum distance between buildings on the same lot.
In all residence districts the minimum distance between principal
buildings shall equal at least the average height of such buildings
at the points where such buildings are closest to one another.
(1)
D.
§ 331-13 WINDOW CLEANERS § 331-13
325:1205
The minimum distance between any principal building and any
accessory building shall in no case be less than the height of
the accessory building but in no case less than 10 feet. See
§ 331-45A(1)(c).
(2)
Major development subdivision of certain building lots in the DMU,
DMUR, MUFE, and DB Districts. Notwithstanding other provisions in
this chapter, a building lot located in the DMU Downtown Mixed-
Use District, DMUR Downtown Mixed-Use Urban Renewal District,
MUFE Mixed-Use Family Entertainment District, or the DB Downtown
Business District, which contains at least 75,000 square feet of
horizontal lot area (the development site) and on which at least 300,000
square feet of building gross floor area is constructed or approved
to be constructed, may be horizontally and/or vertically subdivided
into Building Lots which do not comply with the bulk and dimensional
requirements of this chapter (major development lots), provided that:
[Amended 9-20-2005 by Ord. No. 225-2005]
Each such major development lot shall contain at least 1,000,000
cubic feet of area;
(1)
All major development lots which together constitute the
development site shall be subject to one combined and integrated
approval under the State Environmental Quality Review Act
(SEQRA) and, as may be applicable, one combined and integrated
site plan, subdivision, special permit and/or variance approval;
(2)
Each of such major development lots shall be serviced by separate
water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer utility lines;
(3)
All of the major development lots which together constitute a
development site shall be subject to a declaration of covenants and
easements, recorded against all such major development lots, in
form and substance acceptable to the Corporation Counsel of the
City, and to which all mortgages and liens (except for the lien of
real property taxes) on such lots shall be subordinated, containing
the following at a minimum:
Cross-easements for structural support, utilities, pedestrian,
vehicular, and emergency services access, and off-street
parking between or among such major development lots;
(a)
A requirement that the owner of each major development lot
maintain a policy of commercial general liability insurance
providing liability insurance against claims for bodily injury,
death and property damage occurring in, on or about such
owner's major development lot, including property damage as
a result of fire or other casualty, and that such policy shall
name all of the owners of the other major development lots as
additional insureds;

Covenants that require the owner of each major development
lot to maintain the building(s) and/or structure(s) located on
such owner's major development lot in accordance with
commercially accepted first class standards, and, if applicable,
as is necessary to ensure the continued structural and
functional integrity of all of the buildings and structures
constructed on the development site, and that give each owner
a right of self-help upon the failure of any owner to perform its
maintenance obligations;
(c)
A requirement that the major development lot which has the
most at-grade frontage along the public sidewalks which adjoin
the development site shall be solely and entirely responsible
for maintenance, repair and replacement of and shall assume
all liability for all of the sidewalks and curbs which adjoin the
development site; and
(d)
In the event the City cannot after due diligence determine
which between or among such major development lots is
responsible for a violation of City state, and/or federal codes
and/or regulations regarding maintenance of the properties
and/or buildings on such major development lots, the City may
serve the owners of all such major development lots with such
violations and all such owners shall consent to the jurisdiction
of the court hearing such violations.
(e)
Dimensional. parking, and sign requirements, as set forth this
chapter and the Sign Ordinance,340 shall be applied as though the
entire development site were one building lot;
(5)
A subdivision of a development site shall be considered a major
development subdivision subject to this Subsection E even if there
are fewer than three major development lots; and
(6)
The plat for the subdivision shall be in a format acceptable for filing
in the Westchester County Clerk's Office.
(7)
Use of yards.
Buildings and structures. No principal building shall be
constructed on any portion of a lot which is less in width than the
minimum required for the district in which it is located. No building

(b)
(1)
Site coverage.
Open space. Total open space, which is both accessible and
nonaccessible to the public, shall represent no less than 40%
of David's Island's total upland area. No less than 25 % of the
David's Island's total upland area shall be accessible to the
public.
(a)
Vegetated buffers. As viewed from the mainland or Long Island
Sound, David's Island shall provide the appearance of a
horizontal hedge of vegetation and tree canopy which, between
ground level and 30 feet above ground level, appears no less
than 50% solid, so as to preserve the appearance of a heavily
vegetated island and to reduce the vertical scale of buildings
facing the mainland or Long Island Sound. Vegetation shall be
salt-water-tolerant and reach its minimum required screening
within 10 years of planting.
(b)
Setbacks. All buildings and structures, except those needed for
a water-dependent use, shall be set back from the mean hightide
line a minimum of 35 feet where there is a seawall, or 80
feet where there is no seawall, in order to create a continuous
waterfront yard area around David's Island, unless a greater
(c)
(2)
A.
§ 331-67 WINDOW CLEANERS § 331-68
325:1305
setback is needed to provide the previously mentioned
horizontal hedge of vegetation and tree canopy. Structures
permitted within a waterfront yard area shall be durable,
nonobtrusive, harmonious, and unified in terms of color and
materials, including exterior lighting, walkways, fences,
benches, signs, piers, and docks.
Traffic impacts.
Development on David's Island shall not result in mainland
intersection traffic capacity below level of service "c" and any
developer of David's Island shall improve the following
intersections (if current level of service is less than "c"), that
could be affected by new Island development:
Pelham Road and Weyman Avenue
Pelham Road and Church Street
Pelham Road and Centre Avenue
Pelham Road and North Avenue
Pelham Road and Franklin Avenue
(a)
Level of service "c" is a delay at signalized intersections of less
than 20 seconds and no more than 35 seconds per vehicle. It
includes acceleration, queue move-up time, stopped delay, and
final acceleration. It can be influenced by signal cycle length,
the advantage or disadvantage to a lane from signal timing,
and signal progression for vehicle movements.
(b)
(3)
Design requirements.
Overall design must minimize environmental impacts,
including impacts on water quality, habitat, natural resources.
(a)
Roofs of buildings shall be designed to minimize the visibility
of roof structures, mechanical equipment and other structures
normally built above the roof. When possible, such roofs shall
be used as patios, decks, and usable space in conjunction with
an adjacent or adjoining use, but will not be considered as
contributing to the open space requirement of 40%.
(b)
Existing topographical features shall be used and respected to
organize land uses and building masses, as much as possible.
Flood and coastal erosion hazards shall be mitigated in site
design.
(c)
Setbacks, corner treatments, and other design details shall
be used to minimize the sense of bulk of structures. Facade
treatment, building materials, and ornamental elements shall
be used as appropriate to enhance and restore Fort Slocum's
historical waterfront context, complementing the character
and scale of mainland buildings which commonly use red brick,
(d)
(4)
§ 331-68 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 331-68
325:1306
stucco and concrete materials, have a maximum building
height of eight stories, and provide variety in building heights
and widths.
Future buildings shall reflect period styles and architectural
details of existing National Register eligible buildings, such
as by using Romanesque Revival porches, porticoes, round
or segmentally arched openings, and decorative brickwork as
accent building elements. Where existing building details can
be salvaged, an attempt shall be made to preserve, display
and incorporate these details in the design of public open
spaces, such as in plazas, sculpture gardens, and entryways.
The location and rectangular form of the parade grounds and
walkways shall be considered in the layout of future buildings
and open spaces.
(e)
Adaptive reuse of existing structures and features shall be
encouraged when economically and technically feasible, in a
unified development program.
(f)
Buildings and spaces shall direct views and pedestrian
movements towards the water.
(g)
Visual access and recreational use of the waterfront perimeter
shall be encouraged.
(h)
Any proposed marina should be located on the western edge of
the Island because of the proximity to the existing navigational
channels, the lack of underwater shoals, and the protection
afforded from prevailing storms.
(i)
Access to David's Island.
Waterborne public transportation is the preferred means of
providing access to David's Island. Access shall be provided
by bridge only where the project proponent demonstrates,
by competent financial evidence, that the proponent cannot
realize a reasonable return by utilizing any other means of
access to the Island.
(a)
Proposals must meet all design and development criteria, and
at least the following standards:
The access means must not interfere with existing federal
navigation channels, garages, access ramps, and
streetlights, must have a minimal visual impact from
existing or proposed public parks and public open spaces
in New Rochelle and other municipalities with views of
David's Island and from Long Island Sound.

ARTICLE X
Floating Zones
§ 331-77. Introduction; definition.
§ 331-78. SFCH Single-Family Cluster Housing Floating Zone.
See § 331-28D(1).
A. See § 331-28D.
Introduction; floating zone. A floating zone district defines a use, such
as an office complex, educational institution, research laboratory, or
multifamily housing, that the community wants to encourage. The
floating zone can be affixed to a qualifying parcel of land, either upon
approval of the application of the parcel's owner or upon the initiative
of the City Council. Upon approval, the parcel is rezoned to reflect
the new use and becomes its own zoning district; its development is
governed by the use, dimensional and other provisions of the floating
zone regulations. Floating zones are distinct from overlay zones
because of several features, the most significant of which is that
floating zones are not mapped until legally placed, while overlay zones
are mapped. The substantive difference is that a floating zone replaces
an underlying zoning district, while overlays work in tandem with
existing underlying zoning districts.
B.
Authority. Pursuant to § 37 of the New York General City Law, the
Planning Board may, as a matter of its original jurisdiction and subject
to the procedures, standards and limitations hereinafter set out, permit,
simultaneously with the approval of a subdivision plat, deviations from
the zoning requirements established by this chapter governing the
average density of population permitted in the zoning district where
such land lies.
A.
Purpose. Cluster development procedures permit minor modifications
of the yard, bulk and space requirements, other than minimum open
space requirements, minimum lot area per unit and per bedroom
requirements and lot coverage requirements, applicable in the various
districts established by this chapter. Cluster development permits the
grouping of structures in order to plan more usable open space or to
preserve open space or historic or scenic features without exceeding
overall density or land coverage requirements. This floating zone allows
for development of single-family cluster housing.
B.
Initiation. An application for a cluster development permit may be filed
by the owner of, or other person having a contractual interest in, a
property that is at least four contiguous acres in size; this regulation is
applicable to all residential districts.
C.
D. Procedure.
§ 331-77 WINDOW CLEANERS § 331-78
325:1317

General City Law.
(2)
Action by Planning Board. Within 62 days following the conclusion
of the public hearing, the Planning Board shall render its decision,
either granting the application for cluster development approval;
granting it subject to conditions as specified in Subsection F below;
or denying the application. The failure of the Planning Board to act
within 62 days, or such longer period of time as may be agreed
to by the applicant, shall be deemed a denial of the application.
Within five business days of such decision or the expiration of
such period, the Clerk of the Planning Board shall mail notice of
such decision or failure to act to all parties entitled thereto as
provided by General City Law, file such decision in the Office of
the City Clerk, and, in the event that a cluster development site
plan application is approved and a building permit is authorized,
the Building Official shall issue such permit, listing therein any and
all conditions imposed by the Planning Board.
(3)
Requirements for cluster developments.
Authorized uses. No use shall be authorized by a cluster
development site plan approval except uses permitted or
permissible in the district in which such development is to be
located. Approval of a cluster development for a use requiring any
special approval shall not excuse the requirement of obtaining such
special approval.
(1)
Density and coverage. No site plan approval for a cluster
development shall authorize any increase in the overall density
or intensity of development nor any increase in the overall lot
coverage permitted by the district regulations applicable in the
district in which such development is to be located. All land
devoted to private street purposes shall be excluded from density,
intensity and lot coverage calculations.
(2)
Standards. Site plan approval for a cluster development shall be
granted only if evidence is presented which establishes that:
(a) The minimum parcel size shall be four acres.
(b) The maximum parcel size shall be 20 acres.
The proposed development will be in harmony with the general
purpose, goals, objectives and standards of the Comprehensive
Plan, this chapter and Chapter A361, Article II, Subdivision
Procedures.
(c)
(3)
E.
§ 331-78 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 331-78
325:1320
The proposed building and/or use complies with all applicable
regulations of this chapter except as modified pursuant to the
authority of this section.
(d)
The proposed building and/or use will not have a substantial or
undue adverse effect upon adjacent property, the character of
the neighborhood, traffic conditions, parking, utility facilities
and other matters affecting the public health, safety and
general welfare.
(e)
The proposed cluster development will be constructed,
arranged and operated so as not to dominate the immediate
vicinity or to interfere with the development and use of
neighboring property in accordance with the applicable
district regulations.
(f)
The proposed cluster development will be served adequately
by essential public facilities and services, such as highways,
streets, parking spaces, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewers, and schools; or
that the persons or agencies responsible for the establishment
of the proposed use will provide adequately for such services.
(g)
The proposed cluster development will not result in the
destruction, loss or damage of any natural, scenic or historic
feature of significant importance.
(h)
Conditions on cluster developments. The Planning Board may impose
such conditions upon the premises benefited by a site plan approval for
a cluster development as may be necessary to ensure its compatibility
with other development in the neighborhood. Such conditions shall
be expressly set forth in the resolution authorizing the cluster
development and granting site plan approval. Violation of such
conditions shall be considered a violation of this chapter.
F.
Effect of issuance of a cluster development site plan approval
The site plan approval for a cluster development shall, upon the
filing of a plat of such approved development with the Recorder
of Deeds of Westchester County, constitute an amendment of the
bulk, space and yard regulations of this chapter applicable to such
development, and thereafter such plat shall constitute the bulk,
space and yard regulations applicable to such development.
(1)
However, the issuance of site plan approval for a cluster
development shall not authorize the establishment or extension
of any use nor the development, construction, reconstruction,
alteration or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely
authorize the preparation, filing and processing of applications for
any permits or approvals which may be required by the codes and
ordinances of the City or state, including, but not limited to, a

permit for a special permit use, a building permit, a certificate of
occupancy and subdivision approval.
Expiration of site plan approval for cluster development. Unless
otherwise specifically set forth by the Planning Board in connection
with its approval of a cluster subdivision, such approval shall expire if a
building permit is not issued within one year from the date of approval
and if all construction work is not substantially completed within two
years of the date of issuance of such approval. Upon application to the
Planning Board, extensions totaling a maximum of 12 months may be
granted to the site plan approval effective date, for appropriate cause.
H.
Adjustments to cluster development during construction. During the
construction of a cluster development, the Building Official may
authorize minor adjustments to the approved cluster development
when such adjustments appear necessary in light of technical or
engineering considerations first discovered during actual development.
No such minor adjustment shall authorize the violation of any of the
requirements set forth in Subsection E nor result in:
Altering the bulk of any one structure or altering the bulk of a
member of similar structures by more than 10 %.
(1)
Altering the location of any one structure or group of structures
by more than 10 feet or 0.1 of the distance shown on the plat
between such structure or structures and any other structure or
any vehicular circulation element or any boundary of the cluster
development, whichever is less.
(2)
Altering the boundary of any open space by more than 20 feet in
any direction.
(3)
Reducing the total amount of open space by more than 5% or
reducing the yard area or open space associated with any single
structure by more than 5%.
(4)
Such minor adjustments shall be consistent with the intent and
purpose of the Comprehensive Plan, this chapter and the approved
cluster development plat, and shall be the minimum necessary to
overcome the particular difficulty.
(5)
I.
Amendments to cluster developments. In addition to the minor
adjustments authorized by Subsection I(5) above, an approved cluster
development may be amended in the same manner and subject to the
same limitations as any other regulation established by this chapter,
except that site plan review and approval pursuant to Article XIII of
this chapter shall be required in connection with any such proposed
amendment in excess of the standards set forth in Subsection I.

ARTICLE XI
Overlay Zones
§ 331-81. Introduction; definition.
§ 331-82. Single-Family Senior Citizen (SFSC) District.
See § 331-28E(1).
A. See § 331-28E.
Introduction. An overlay zone is a mapped district superimposed on
one or more established zoning districts which may be used to impose
supplemental restrictions on uses in these districts, permit uses
otherwise disallowed, or implement some form of density bonus or
incentive bonus program. The underlying zone persists with the overlay
procedures imposed as supplemental regulations. Overlay zones are
distinct from floating zones because of several features, the most
significant of which is that overlay zones are mapped, and floating
zones are not mapped.
B.
Purpose. The Single-Family Senior Citizen (SFSC) Overlay District is
hereby established as an overlay zone with potential applicability to any
property that meets the minimum eligibility requirements as set forth
in Subsection C. The intent of this district is to facilitate development
of homes that are specifically designed to meet the needs of senior
citizens who prefer the single-family type home and single-family form
of ownership, but require certain facilities and amenities to meet their
changing physical and social needs, allow flexibility in design and
promote preservation of open space.
A.
The boundaries of each SFSC Overlay District shall be fixed by
amendment to the official City Zoning Map wherever mapping of this
District is approved. A metes and bounds description of each such
district shall be filed with the office of the City Clerk.
B.
Eligibility. The following are the minimum eligibility requirements for
establishing any property for SFSC zoning:
(1) The minimum parcel size shall be five contiguous acres.
C.
Development standards.
Permitted principal uses.
One-family detached dwellings as permitted and regulated in
the underlying zoning district.
(a)
(1)
Permitted accessory uses.
Uses and structures which are clearly incidental and
customary to the permitted principal use on the lot on which it
is located.
(a)
(2)
D.
§ 331-81 WINDOW CLEANERS § 331-82
325:1335
Indoor and outdoor recreation facilities, clubhouses, a
community swimming pool, and off-street parking. The use of
any recreation facility and/or clubhouse shall be limited to the
residents of the dwellings and their nonpaying guests.
(b)
Design features. The housing in an SFSC District shall be specifically
designed to meet the needs of senior citizens who can generally live
independently without medical care typically provided in a nursing
home or assisted living facility. The following types of facilities and
amenities shall be provided in a single-family senior citizen
development:
The main exterior access to each home shall be provided without
steps.
(1)
Each home shall be built primarily for first floor living, with a
master bedroom and wheelchair accessible bathroom provided on
that floor. If a proposed home has a two-story design, the second
story and basement shall be adaptable for construction of an
elevator, by providing framing for an elevator shaft. The space may
be used for a closet until the elevator is installed. If a proposed
home has a one-story design, it shall be adaptable for future
installation of an elevator or lift to the basement.
(2)
Homes shall be further built to meet seniors' daily accessibility
requirements with doorways sufficiently wide to accommodate a
wheelchair. At least one bathroom and the kitchen shall be
appropriately designed to enable wheelchair turning in a single
turn. The bathroom and kitchen shall be made adaptable in
accordance with CABO/ANSI standards in force at the time of
construction.
(3)
Emergency communication services, including heat and smoke
detectors, shall be provided linking homes with:
One or more among the following which are staffed 24 hours a
day: the clubhouse, community room, and gatehouse; or
(a)
(b) A twenty-four-hour off-premise monitoring service.
(4)
Due consideration shall be given in planning walks, ramps and
driveways to prevent slipping or stumbling; handrails and ample
places for rest shall be strategically provided.
(5)
Appearance and design of one-family dwellings. All proposed
homes within the development shall be architecturally related in
exterior appearance to neighboring buildings then in existence or
for which a building permit has been issued. The building shall be
architecturally related to neighboring buildings as to color, texture,
scale, and materials. The Planning Board shall review and approve
the appearance and design of one-family dwellings within the SFSC
District at the time of subdivision review.

Purpose. The Cabaret Overlay Zone is hereby established to improve
the function, aesthetics and manageability of this particular land use
and to provide the City of New Rochelle with a better method of control
and enforcement. The Cabaret Overlay Zone encourages accessory
cabaret uses in specific designated areas of the City that are more
urban and commercialized and are more appropriate locations for this
use while limiting the expansions of such uses to more residential
neighborhoods. This overlay zone will limit cabarets to the major
commercialized areas and the arterial routes through the City.

Purpose. The purpose of the Water View Overlay Zone is to minimize
the impact of development on water views enjoyed by the public on
adjacent rights-of-way and by adjacent and upland property owners,
including winter water views. The Water View Overlay Zone imposes
dimensional requirements that may be more restrictive than the
underlying zoning on sites where water views, including winter water
views, are enjoyed by the public on adjacent rights-of-way and by
adjacent and upland property owners.
A.
Applicability. Any building permit application to construct a new
building; to replace or to expand an existing building; to construct
any accessory building; to construct any accessory structure or add
equipment onto the roof of a building or structure in the mapped Water
View Overlay Zone shall require the prior granting of a special permit
by the Planning Board, pursuant to the special permit procedures
and standards set forth in §§ 331-88 and 331-89 of this chapter and
submission of the proof required under this section, except that the
following shall not require the granting of a special permit: [Amended
6-19-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-121]
Replacement of a portion or all of an existing building within its
existing footprint, exclusive of any unenclosed porches, decks and
terraces, as permitted by the underlying zoning, provided none
of such replacement creates a height of building in excess of the
building's highest roof ridgeline.
(1)
Expansion or replacement of an existing building toward a side lot
line, including a side lot line along a street, as permitted by the
underlying zoning, which construction does not extend closer to
such side lot line than the nearest point of the existing building
to such side lot line, provided none of such construction creates a
height of building in excess of the building's existing roof ridgeline.
(2)
Expansion or replacement of an existing building toward a front or
rear lot line, as permitted by the underlying zoning, provided none
of such construction creates a height of building in excess of the
building's existing roof ridgeline. For buildings or structures with
(3)
B.
§ 331-83 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 331-84
325:1340
flat roofs, building height shall be taken from the top of the rafters
of the flat roof or roofs. This exception shall not apply to front or
rear yards that are not oriented perpendicular to the water where
an improvement would obstruct an otherwise unobstructed view of
the water. [Amended 12-13-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-245]
Construction alongside an existing building of an unscreened patio
or deck no higher than three feet in height above the existing
underlying ground level.
(4)
Construction on an existing or proposed building of an open rooftop
deck with Open Railings or illuminated posts no higher than 3 1/
2 feet in height above such deck, provided the surface of the deck
does not create a height of building in excess of six inches above
the building's existing roof ridgeline. No vegetation, barbeques or
other cooking equipment shall be allowed on any such open rooftop
deck.
(5)
New vegetation planted and maintained so as not to exceed a
maximum height of four feet, unless a water view would otherwise
be obstructed by other waterside structures on site, in which case
said vegetation shall not exceed the height of the other waterside
structure. [Amended 12-13-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-245]
(6)
(7) New fencing that does not exceed a maximum height of four feet.
Procedures, standards, and proof for special permit.
An applicant for a special permit required under this section shall
submit proof to the Planning Board that the construction of a new
building or replacement or expansion of an existing building on the
site shall not block any significant existing water views, including
winter water views, enjoyed by the public on adjacent rights-ofway
and/or by adjacent and/or upland property owners, if such
views are commonly and frequently enjoyed and easily accessible,
including winter water views or if the loss of such view would
negatively affect property values. This proof shall include, without
limitation, visual demonstration on the applicant's property which
identifies the height of the proposed construction or proposed
planting. If the Planning Board determines that the special permit
procedures and/or standards set forth in §§ 331-88 and 331-89
of this chapter have not been met and/or if the Planning Board
determines that any significant existing water views, if such views
are commonly and frequently enjoyed and easily accessible,
enjoyed by the public on adjacent rights-of-way and/or by adjacent
and/or upland property owners, including winter water views, are
blocked, the special permit shall be denied.
(1)
Insofar as the protection of winter water views is also required,
application for special permit approval shall be made at a time
when the applicant can demonstrate that winter water views, due

to the lack of leaves on deciduous trees and which are enjoyed by
the public or private property owners, are not being significantly
blocked.
If petitioned by the applicant, the Planning Board is authorized
to grant a waiver to expand an existing building by a maximum
distance of five feet beyond the front or rear lot setback line
currently required by the underlying zoning district, if the Planning
Board determines, after Special Permit public hearing, that such
waiver will not significantly block any existing water views.
(3)
Additional regulations. Prior to the issuance of a permit for demolition
of an existing building or a portion thereof or for any alteration of the
existing roof, the applicant shall submit a recent survey conduct by a
licensed surveyor or engineer in order to establish the height of the
existing roof ridgeline.
D.
Purpose. The Senior Citizen Zone (SC) District is hereby established
as an overlay zone with potential applicability to any property with
underlying single-family, two-family and/or multifamily residence zones
of maximum height of three stories of at least five contiguous acres
in the City of New Rochelle. These provisions are enacted to provide
for proper multifamily housing of the City's senior citizens. It is hereby
recognized that the City has a high proportion of senior citizens, and,
given present economic conditions, limited or fixed incomes, physical
restrictions and the rapidly accelerating costs of maintaining a singlefamily
residence, the City Council deems it necessary to provide for
senior citizen multifamily housing within the City. [Amended
1-17-2017 by Ord. No. 16-2017]
A.
The boundaries of each SC District shall be fixed by amendment to
the Official City Zoning Map wherever this District is applied. A metes
and bounds description of each such District shall be kept on file in
the Office of the City Clerk. Although it is anticipated that SC rezoning
applications will be submitted on a voluntary basis by applicants, the
City Council may, on its own motion, rezone property into an SC
District. Although this District is intended for sites of at least five acres,
the City Council may consider applications for smaller properties and
the Council reserves the authority to grant relief from applicable bulk
zoning standards if special circumstances warrant, said circumstances
to be provided by the applicant or the City Council. [Amended
1-17-2017 by Ord. No. 16-2017]
B.
Occupancy restrictions. The SC Zone is primarily designed for the
needs of senior citizens who prefer multifamily or the type of occupancy
that requires certain facilities and amenities to meet their changing

Purpose. The Fifth Avenue Overlay Zone is established to improve the
function, aesthetics, and accessibility of Fifth Avenue, Potter Avenue,
Pleasant Avenue, Plain Avenue, and other streets contained within the
area bounded to the north by Fifth Avenue, to the east by the City
limit line, to the south by the New York State Thruway, and to the
west by Potter Avenue, so as to phase out nonconforming buildings and
uses and to promote attractive commercial, light industrial, and mixeduse
residential development, which will complement and be compatible
with City Park. Specifically the following objectives are encouraged:
[Amended 11-15-2016 by Ord. No. 233-2016]
A.
§ 331-85 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 331-85.1
325:1346
(1) Phase-out of incompatible, nonconforming uses:
Assembly of existing smaller lots into larger lots to create full-depth
commercial and light industrial parcels between Fifth and Plain
Avenues and between Plain Avenue and Pleasant Street.
(2)
Construction of attractive building facades along Fifth and Potter
Avenues with off-street rear parking lots.
(3)
Development of mixed commercial uses on ground and upper floors
of buildings, such as but not limited to artisans, trades, workshops,
and showrooms.
(4)
Creation of off-street parking lots for shared parking between
adjoining and neighboring principal uses.
(5)
(6) Elimination of curb cuts and driveways to Fifth and Potter Avenues.
Application of enhanced street access, building design, off-street
parking, landscaping, and buffering controls by the Planning Board
to enhance the physical appearance of properties in the Fifth
Avenue Overlay Zone.
(7)
Creation of a mixed-use district that includes live-work space in
accordance with § 331-72C and small-scale manufacturers.
(8)
Development of multifamily residential uses not to exceed three
stories.
(9)
Permitted uses. In addition to those uses permitted by right in the
underlying LI Light Industrial District, the following use shall be
permitted by right in the Fifth Avenue Overlay Zone:
(1) Self-storage facility, only if totally new construction.
B.
Permitted uses on Fifth Avenue. In addition to those uses permitted
by right in the underlying LI Light Industrial District, the following
uses shall be permitted by right in the Fifth Avenue Overlay Zone,
provided they front on Fifth Avenue or are located within 200 feet of
the intersections of Fifth Avenue with Portman Road or Valley Place,
respectively: [Amended 11-15-2016 by Ord. No. 233-2016]
(1) Restaurants.
(2) Restaurants, carry-out.
(3) Banks.
(4) Health clubs.
(5) Self-service laundromats.

underlying LI Light Industrial District shall be allowed as special permit
uses in the Fifth Avenue Overlay Zone.
D.
Street access, building design, off-street parking, landscaping, and
buffering guidelines. The Planning Board shall, in its site plan review of
applications, consider street access, building design, off-street parking,
landscaping and buffering for all new construction and expansion of
existing buildings in the Fifth Avenue Overlay Zone. In accordance
with existing regulations, site plan approval is required prior to the
issuance of a building permit for the construction or enlargement of
any principal use and prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy
for any change of use or occupancy, which would result in an increase
in the requirement for off-street parking or loading spaces and for any
parking lot created or altered in accordance with the provisions of
Article XIV of this chapter. The Planning Board is authorized, in its
sole discretion in exercising site plan approval authority, to require that
buildings not be set back greater than five feet from front property lines
along Fifth and Potter Avenues; to prohibit curb cuts and driveways and
to require the underground siting of on-site utilities of all properties
fronting on Fifth and Potter Avenues; to require additional buffering,
landscaping, and screening for all properties in the Fifth Avenue
Overlay Zone; to require additional architectural detailing, mansard
roofs, and fenestration (albeit faux) of building facades that front Fifth
and Potter Avenues; to restrict loading and delivery areas along Fifth
and Potter Avenues; and to permit alternate locations for required offstreet
parking facilities in accordance with § 331-126E(3) herein. The
Planning Board may also reduce the total number of off-street parking
and loading spaces required for all properties in the Fifth Avenue
Overlay Zone, where the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the Board that the capacity of a shared-use facility will satisfy the
purposes of this zoning ordinance by reason of variation in the probable
time of maximum use by visitors, patrons, deliverers and/or employees.
E.
Planning Board development incentives. In conjunction with site plan
review of an application in the Fifth Avenue Overlay Zone located on
a parcel of land containing not less than 10,000 square feet in gross
site area, the Planning Board may, in its sole discretion, waive the front
yard requirement on one of the two required streets for a through
lot where the main entrance of the lot fronts on the street where the
required front yard has been provided; increase the allowable floor area
ratio (FAR) for such development from 1.0 to a maximum FAR of 3.25;
increase the allowable building coverage from 60% to a maximum of
80%; increase the allowable impervious surface coverage from 90% to
F.
§ 331-85.1 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 331-85.1
325:1348
100%; increase the allowable building height of two stories or 40 feet
to a maximum of four stories or 55 feet in the underlying LI Light
Industrial District, provided the proposed development shall achieve
one or more of the following: [Amended 5-20-2015 by Ord. No.
117-2015]
(1) Phase out nonconforming uses;
Develop mixed commercial uses on ground and upper floors of
buildings, such as but not limited to artisans, trades, workshops,
and showrooms;
(2)
Create off-street rear parking lots behind the buildings fronting
onto Fifth and Potter Avenues;
(3)
Create uses and structures that significantly increase the property
and/or sales tax revenues benefiting the City and/or contribute to
the creation of additional jobs, as compared to the existing uses
and buildings on the site;
(4)
Assemble existing smaller lots into larger lots to create full-depth
commercial and light industrial parcels between Fifth and Plain
Avenues and between Plain Avenue and Pleasant Street; and
(5)
Provide other on-site or off-site public amenities and benefits
which, in the opinion of the Planning Board, enhance the project
or the neighborhood and outweigh any negative impacts created by
the more permissive dimensional standards that may be granted by
the Board.
(6)
Conflicts between the Fifth Avenue Overlay Zone and the LI Light
Industrial District. In the event of conflict between the requirements of
the Fifth Avenue Overlay Zone and the LI Light Industrial District, the
requirements of the Fifth Avenue Overlay Zone shall control.
G.
Mixed-use, multifamily residential, and live-work space in accordance
with § 331-72C. To promote creation of a mixed-use district, mixeduse
buildings, multifamily residential, and live-work space shall be
permitted in the Fifth Avenue Overlay District. The following
dimensional requirements apply to new construction of buildings that
include commercial uses on the ground floor, such as, but not limited
to, artisans, trades, workshops, and showrooms. Upper floors should
include multifamily residential units and/or live-work space for artisans.

NOTES:
1CPA: Central Parking Area (See Zoning Map and § 331-126H for
eligibility.)
Shared use of parking. The total number of off-street parking and
loading spaces required shall be the sum of the requirements for each
individual use, except that such total may be reduced in mixed-use
districts by the Planning Board where the applicant demonstrates to
the satisfaction of the Board that the capacity of the facility will satisfy
the purposes of this chapter by reason of variation in the probable
time of maximum use by residents, visitors, patrons, deliverers and/or
employees as well as use of certain alternative modes of transportation.
The applicant may submit a Parking Management Plan by using the
standards provided in the most recent edition of Shared Parking
published by the Urban Land Institute and other supporting
nationally and locally recognized standards to demonstrate to the
Planning Board the maximum parking demand required for each
development. Where two or more uses on the Site or Off-Site
(1)
A.
§ 331-126 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 331-126
325:1454
locations complying with § 331-126A are able to share the same
parking spaces because their parking demands occur at different
times, the same parking spaces may be counted to satisfy the offstreet
parking requirements for each use upon the approval of a
Parking Management Plan by the Planning Board. Applications for
a Parking Management Plan approval shall include:
The names and addresses of the uses and of the owners or
tenants who will share the parking.
(a)
(b) The location and number of parking spaces to be shared.
An analysis showing that the peak parking times of the uses
occur at different times and that the parking area will be large
enough for the anticipated demands of all uses as prepared by
a parking consultant or traffic engineer.
(c)
A legal instrument, such as a lease, easement or deed
restriction, that guarantees the parking will be provided on
site or off site so long as the associated uses remain, and
access to the parking for multiple uses according to an
approved Parking Management Plan, which shall be submitted
to the Corporate Counsel of the City for review and approval.
No parking spaces to be shared shall be reserved or allotted to
any individual.
(d)
Approval of Shared Parking: The Planning Board may grant an
application for shared parking associated with a Parking
Management Plan if it finds that:
The analysis provided presents a realistic projection of parking
demands likely to be generated.
(a)
Peak demand is sufficiently distinct so that the Planning Board
is able to clearly identify a number of spaces for which there
will rarely be an overlap of parking demand.
(b)
Rights to the use of spaces are clearly identified so as to
facilitate enforcement.
(c)
(2)
Limitations on reserved spaces. No more than 10% of the minimum
required off-street parking spaces designed to serve nonresidential
uses and no more than one space per dwelling unit in multifamily
residential developments shall be permitted to be reserved for the
exclusive use of individual dwelling units, persons and/or business
establishments. Limitations on reserved spaces do not apply to parking
spaces provided in excess of the minimum requirements of this chapter.
B.
Limitations on leasing. All spaces required to serve the principal use
shall not be leased to serve other uses, unless a valid special permit has
been issued for valet operations on a site.
C.
§ 331-126 WINDOW CLEANERS § 331-126
325:1455
Effect on existing structures and uses. Structures and uses legally in
existence or for which building permits have been issued prior to the
effective date of this chapter shall not be subject to the parking or
loading space requirements of this chapter, provided that any parking
and loading facilities existing or approved to serve such structures
or uses shall not in the future be reduced or redesignated to serve
other structures or uses, except to the extent that they exceed such
requirements. At the time of any enlargement, change or expansion of
existing structures or uses in the future, the following requirements
shall apply:
Required parking and loading facilities for that part of the
structure or use which constitutes an enlargement or expansion
shall be provided in accordance with all requirements of this
chapter.
(1)
To the maximum extent deemed feasible and reasonable by the
Planning Board, during site plan review and approval, parking and
loading facilities shall also be provided to serve the existing portion
of such structure or use that does not conform to all parking and
loading space requirements of this chapter.
(2)
At the time of any change of use which would result in an increased
off-street parking or loading space requirement, the additional
parking and loading spaces so required shall be provided in
accordance with all applicable requirements of this chapter.
(3)
The provisions in items § 331-126D(1) through (3), regardless of
use, shall not apply to existing commercial spaces with less than
2,000 square feet of gross floor area, and an occupancy that does
not exceed 49 people.
(4)
D.
Alternate methods of complying with parking and loading
requirements.
Parking requirements as provided in this chapter may otherwise
be satisfied for any new construction, new use or change of use
where the nearest entrance of such new construction, new use or
change of use is located within 1,350 feet, measured along public
streets, of a municipal parking garage or a municipal parking lot,
and where the applicant demonstrates that such garage or lot
can accommodate the required parking for such new construction,
new use or change of use, by submission of proof based upon
available permit spaces and lot usage, which submission shall be
reviewed by the City official responsible for municipal parking
facilities. Where it is determined that the required parking cannot
be accommodated, then the applicant shall either seek a variance
from the Board of Appeals on Zoning or otherwise provide the
required parking. Notwithstanding the foregoing, within the
Central Parking Area, as shown on the Zoning Map and further
defined in § 331-126H, no new residential construction, new
(1)
E.
§ 331-126 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 331-126
325:1456
residential use, or change of use to residential, which includes any
dwelling unit including living/loft use, shall be eligible to have its
parking requirements satisfied by the provisions of this Subsection
E(1) except pursuant to the residential fee-in-lieu procedure set
forth in Subsection H(6) below.
(2) (Reserved)
Alternate locations. Required off-street parking facilities shall be
provided on the same lot with the structure or use which they
serve, except as follows:
The Planning Board may allow all or part of the parking spaces
required to serve structures or uses to be located on any lot
entirely within 500 feet of the structures or uses to be served,
provided such parking is a lawful use in the district in which it
is to be located and further provided that the Planning Board
determines that it is impractical to provide parking on the
same lot with the structures or uses being served.
(a)
In any H, RMF-SC-4.0, or NA District, the required parking
spaces may be provided on any lot within 500 feet of the
structures or uses to be served.
(b)
Where the Planning Board approves the location of such
parking spaces on a lot different from the lot occupied by
the structure or use served, the Planning Board shall require
a legal instrument, in form and filing satisfactory to the
Corporation Counsel, assuring the continued use of said
parking spaces in connection with the uses or structures
served and recorded in the Westchester County Land Records
in the County Clerk's office.
(c)
This section shall not apply to off-street parking being
addressed through Article XXI or § 331-54.2C(3) of this Code.
(d)
(3)
Parking in the front yard contiguous to side yard. In all one- and
two-family zoning districts, parking of a maximum of two registered
private passenger vehicles may be located within a paved driveway
constructed in accordance with a valid building permit, which is
located within that portion of the front yard immediately
contiguous to and an extension of a garage which is integral with
the residence structure and has its entrance door within the front
wall thereof; or that portion of the front yard immediately
contiguous to and an extension of either side yard but not closer
than six feet to the nearest side lot line.
(4)
Parking in the front yard. In all one- and two-family zoning districts,
the Building Official may allow a parking area for a maximum
of two registered private passenger vehicles within a front yard,
provided the following conditions are satisfied:
(5)
§ 331-126 WINDOW CLEANERS § 331-126
325:1457
The topography of the lot is such that there is no vehicular
access to any alternative location.
(a)
The parking spaces shall cover no more than 50% of the front
yard nor exceed 400 square feet in size.
(b)
There is insufficient area within the side and/or rear yards to
locate the parking spaces.
(c)
The parking spaces shall be used solely by the residents of the
dwelling on the same lot as the residence.
(d)
All parked vehicles shall be a minimum of five feet from the
frame of the residence.
(e)
Off-street parking adjacent to nonresidence districts. Off-street
parking may also be permitted on a lot in an RMF Residence
District, subject to the issuance of a special permit by the Planning
Board and subject to compliance with the following special
standards and requirements:
Such parking shall be permitted only on a lot immediately
adjacent to, or directly across the street from, a nonresidence
district and only when located entirely within 250 feet of the
structures or uses served.
(a)
Such parking shall be limited to locations which do not require
traffic to pass through residential neighborhoods prior to
entering or exiting the facility.
(b)
All points of vehicular ingress and egress to such parking shall
be located either within the nonresidence district or directly
across the street from the nonresidence district.
(c)
The hours of operation, exterior lighting, signage, fencing,
landscaping and/or screening (in accordance with
§ 331-119B418 of this chapter) along street frontages and
adjacent residential property lines, shall all be subject to such
requirements as may be imposed by the Planning Board to
protect neighboring residential properties and uses.
(d)
The width of landscaped screening areas abutting or facing
lots in residence districts shall be no less than 10 feet and shall
otherwise comply with the requirements of § 331-130.
(e)
(6)
Loading facilities. Required off-street loading facilities shall be
provided on the same lot with the structure or use which they
serve. However, the Planning Board may allow off-street loading
spaces to be located within the building being served, provided
that the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Planning
(7)
418. Editor's Note: See now § 331-119.1.
§ 331-126 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § 331-126
325:1458
Board that such spaces shall be permanently available for their
intended purpose.
Parking of commercial vehicles. Where commercial vehicles are
proposed to be parked overnight on a nonresidential property, the
following requirements shall apply:
They shall be parked only in spaces specifically designated for
such uses on an approved site plan.
(a)
They shall be vehicles which are accessory to and used on a
regular basis in connection with a permitted principal use on
the premises.
(b)
(c) They shall not be used for the storage of goods.
(8)
Parking of taxicabs and livery vehicles in driveways. Pursuant to
the authority set forth in § 181 of the General Municipal Law, livery
vehicles in excess of 220 inches and taxicabs shall not be parked in
driveways.
(9)
Off-street private passenger car parking in residential districts. Offstreet
parking spaces (whether open or enclosed) in residential districts
shall be restricted to the parking of private passenger cars.
F.
Other Parking Credits.
Nonreserved Parking: For a residential development that has 50
or more parking spaces, the applicant is eligible for a parking
reduction of up to 10% if none of the residential spaces are
reserved or assigned to any individual. This credit is subject to
approval by the Planning Board based upon a parking study.
(1)
Car Share Parking: For parking facilities of 50 spaces or more
(related to any use), the applicant can get a credit of three
conventional parking spaces for every shared car (e.g., zip car)
parked on site. This credit is subject to a maximum of 15% of the
total parking requirement and subject to Planning Board Approval
based upon a parking study.
(2)
G.
Parking within the Central Parking Area.
Eligibility: Only those developments that are a) located within the
Downtown Overlay Zone and b) fulfill the minimum requirements

(1)
Potential Reductions of Required Parking Spaces. In the Central
Parking Area, as set forth in § 331-126H(1) above, where applicants
can demonstrate that certain additional off-street parking space
reductions are justified, the minimum number of parking spaces
required to be provided by an applicant seeking Site Plan approval
may be reduced. The following parking space reductions from the
(2)
H.
§ 331-126 WINDOW CLEANERS § 331-126
325:1459
total requirements may be granted by the Planning Board where
an applicant demonstrates to the Board the following parking
reductions are justified:
Nonreserved Parking:
For parking facilities of greater than 50 spaces, applicants
are eligible for a parking reduction of up to 10% where
100% of residential parking is not reserved or dedicated
for individuals or groups.
[1]
For parking facilities of greater than 50 spaces, applicants
are eligible for a parking credit of up to 5% where 75%
of residential parking is not reserved or dedicated for
individuals or groups.
[2]
All such reductions are at the discretion of the Planning
Board.
[3]
(a)
Attendant and Valet Parking:
For parking facilities of greater than 50 spaces and
offering attendant parking facilities operated at least 16
hours per day, a parking reduction of up to 15% shall be
available at the discretion of the Planning Board.
[1]
Parking facilities designed exclusively for use by attendant
parking facilities may be designed to permit tandem
parking and other compact parking formats.
[2]
All attendant and valet parking facilities shall comply with
the standards established in Article XXI, Valet and
Attendant Parking.
[3]
(b)
Car Share Parking:

spaces may be reduced by three conventional parking
spaces for every one car share space provided up to a
maximum reduction of 15% of the total parking required.
[1]
(c)
After considering all parking reductions permitted in § 331-126A(1)
and H(2) above, in no event shall the total required parking be
reduced by more than (i) 50% in DO-1 and DO-2 or (ii) 30% in DO-3,
DO-4, DO-5 and DO-6 below the base requirements established
in § 331-126, Schedule of Off-Street Parking and Loading Space
Requirements.
(3)
Off-Site Parking.
For a Development Site located within the Downtown Overlay
Zone, off-site municipal or private parking may be provided
within 1,350 feet from such site.

considerations have been met to receive permission to use this
alternate parking facility type.
(a)
(5)
Fee-In-Lieu within the Central Parking Area.
Where an applicant seeks to reduce the required number of
off-street parking spaces within the Central Parking Area, the
applicant shall pay a fee-in-lieu to the applicable parking
agency according to a fee schedule established by the City
Council in Chapter 133, Fees.
(a)
The fee schedule shall establish a one-time fee-in-lieu payment
as well as an annual fee-in-lieu payment.

development projects providing on-site parking in the
Central Parking Area.
[3]
(d)
The Department of Development may accept such fees to
replace a portion of the required parking spaces which will not
be provided on site; however, in no case shall the reduction
of parking exceed the standard established in § 331-126H(3).
Where appropriate, the Department of Development may
require the submission of studies and plans by the applicant
demonstrating that practical considerations preclude the
provision of such parking spaces on site.
(e)
(6)
§ 331-126 WINDOW CLEANERS § 331-126.1
325:1461
Applicability. Off-street bicycle parking facilities shall be provided for
any structure or use requiring site plan approval, pursuant to the
following requirements.
A.
Bicycle Parking Spaces or Bicycle Lockers Required.
For Multifamily Dwellings and Attached Dwelling Units containing
10 or more dwelling units on a Building Lot, a minimum of one
bicycle parking space or bicycle locker shall be provided for each
10 dwelling units except that in no event shall fewer than two
bicycle parking spaces or bicycle lockers be provided on such Lot.
(1)
For mixed uses and all nonresidential uses requiring 10 or more
motor vehicle parking spaces on a Building Lot, one bicycle parking
space or bicycle locker shall be provided for each 10 required
automobile parking spaces, except that in no event shall fewer than
two bicycle parking spaces or bicycle lockers be provided on such
Lot.
(2)
Where not more than two bicycle parking spaces or bicycle lockers
are provided, a single inverted U-frame rack shall be acceptable,
provided adequate parking and access space is provided to be able
to easily secure such two bicycles.
(3)
B.
Design Criteria for Bicycle Parking Facilities.
Off-street parking for bicycles shall include provision for secure
storage of bicycles. Such facilities shall provide bicycle lockers or
racks or equivalent structures in or upon which the user may lock
a bicycle.
(1)
A bicycle parking facility includes any structure or fixture
constructed so as to enable a person to secure bicycles by locking
the frame and one wheel of each bicycle therein. Inverted U-frame
racks that support the bicycle at two or more points above and
on either side of the bicycle's center of gravity are desired, except
that the Commissioner of Development may approve an alternate
style of rack or enclosure that provides a comparable level of
security and convenience. Racks shall be easily usable with both Ulocks

In order to prove such unnecessary hardship, the applicant shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board of Appeals on Zoning
that for each and every permitted use under the zoning regulations
for the particular district where the property is located:
The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that
lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent
financial evidence;
(a)
The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is
unique, and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood;
(b)
The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood; and
(c)
(d) The alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(2)
The Board of Appeals on Zoning, in the granting of use variances,
shall grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary
and adequate to address the unnecessary hardship proven by the

impact such variance may have on the neighborhood or community.

take into consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance
is granted, as weighed against the detriment to the health, safety
and welfare of the neighborhood or community by such grant. In
making such determination the Board shall also consider:
Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by the granting of the area variance;
(a)
Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved
by some method feasible for the applicant to pursue, other
than an area variance;
(b)
(c) Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect
or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the
neighborhood or district; and
(d)
Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Board
of Appeals on Zoning, but shall not necessarily preclude the
granting of the area variance.
(e)
(2)
The Board of Appeals on Zoning, in the granting of area variances,

Affordable Housing
[Added 3-21-2006 by L.L. No. 2-2006420]
§ 331-152. Requirements for Affordable Housing.
Purpose. The City Council of the City of New Rochelle is deeply
concerned that there are insufficient opportunities for individuals and
families of Low Income, Moderate Income, and Median Income to
purchase or rent dwelling units in the City. In order to enhance the
public welfare and to promote the well-being of the City's current
and future residents, the Council believes that it is essential that new
residential and mixed-use developments involving the construction of
more than two new dwelling units be required to include dwelling units
for individuals and families of Moderate Income in Rental Housing
and dwelling units for individuals and families of Median Income in
Purchase Housing or, in the alternative, be required to make payments
to an Affordable Housing Fund to assist in the development of housing
opportunities for individuals and families of Low Income and Moderate
Income in the City. Further, this Council believes that it is essential
that dwelling units for individuals and families of Low Income and
Moderate Income which are scheduled for demolition be replaced with
new affordable housing or, in the alternative, payments be made to
an Affordable Housing Fund to assist in the development of housing
opportunities for individuals and families of Low Income and Moderate
Income in the City.

be.421
LOW INCOME — Annual household income which does not exceed 60%
of the Westchester County median annual income for its household size

developments which have agreed to provide a set aside for affordable housing under

Introduction.
A floating overlay zone is an unmapped district that, at the
discretion of the City Council, may be superimposed on one or
more established underlying zoning districts which may be used to
impose supplemental restrictions on uses in these districts, permit
uses otherwise disallowed, or implement some form of density
bonus or incentive bonus program. The floating overlay zone can
be affixed to a qualifying parcel of land, either upon the application
of the parcel's owner or upon the initiative of the local City Council.
Upon approval, the floating overlay zone is applied to the parcel
and becomes a mapped overlay district. Its development is
governed by the use of the underlying zoning district and the
dimensional and other provisions of the Floating Overlay Zone
Ordinance.
(1)
Floating overlay zones are distinct from overlay zones because
of several features, the most significant of which is that overlay
zones are mapped, and floating overlay zones are not mapped until
legally placed. Floating overlay zones are also distinct from floating
zones; the substantive difference is that a floating zone replaces an
underlying zoning district, while a floating overlay zone works in
tandem with existing underlying zoning districts.

least five days before the hearing if no hearing is held on the draft
environmental impact statement and at least 14 days before the hearing
if the hearing is held jointly with the hearing on the draft environmental
impact statement.
The Commissioner of Development, or his designated representative,
and the City Engineer shall review the preliminary layout and
accompanying documents to ascertain their conformity to the Zoning
Ordinance428 and to these regulations, then meet with the subdivider
with regard to changes deemed advisable, and the kind and extent of
improvements to be made.
C.
The Board shall approve, with or without modification, or disapprove
such preliminary plat within 62 days after the close of the public
hearing. Approval of the preliminary layout by the Board shall be
designated conditional approval. Approval of a minor subdivision may
not require a final plat approval but shall be considered final at this
stage.
D.
The conditions, if any, required by the Board shall be noted on the
original and a print of the preliminary layout. The Commissioner of
Development and one member of the Board shall sign said original and
print as approved by the Board. The Board shall retain the original and
return one print to the subdivider.
E.
Conditional approval of the preliminary layout shall not constitute
approval of any subsequent plat except for minor subdivisions. Rather,
it is an expression of approval of the general design submitted to be
used as a guide for the preparation of the plat to be submitted to the
Board for its approval. For the protection of the subdivider, it is stressed
that the Board's approval of the preliminary layout be secured before
undertaking the final surveys of streets and lots and final construction
plans, and that the start of any grading or street construction work
await approval of the plat by the Board.
F.
The plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary layout approved
by the Board, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only
that portion of the approved preliminary layout which he proposes to
record and develop at the time; provided, however, that said portion
conforms to all requirements of these regulations. In reviewing the plat,
the Board shall comply with the provisions of the State Environmental
Quality Review Act under Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation
Law and its implementing regulations.

§ A361-8 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § A361-9
325:1518
The plat and other documents as specified in § A361-13 shall be
prepared by the subdivider in accordance with the general
requirements and design standards specified in Article IV and shall
be submitted to the Board within six months after approval of the
preliminary layout; otherwise said approval shall become null and void
unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by the Board
within the said six-month period.
B.
Application for approval of the plat shall be submitted in writing by the
subdivider to the Board, together with the original and five prints of the
plat, at least 21 days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered.
A receipt from the Bureau of Buildings for a filing fee for each new lot
as set forth in Chapter 133, Fees, shall accompany the application.
C.
The Board shall hold a public hearing on the plat which shall be
coordinated with any hearings held pursuant to the State
Environmental Quality Review Act, and such hearing shall be held
within 62 days of either the filing of the notice of completion of the draft
environmental impact statement or after receipt of the completed plat.
Such hearing shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation
at least once at least five days before the hearing if no hearing is
held on the draft environmental impact statement and at least 14 days
before the hearing if the hearing is held jointly with the hearing on the
draft environmental impact statement. Approval of the plat shall not
become final until the provisions of Subsections E and F below have
been complied with.
D.
The subdivider shall follow one of the procedures set forth below:
Construction plans for the required improvements prepared in
accordance with § A361-22 shall be submitted to the City Engineer
within 60 days from the date of the plat approval; otherwise said
approval shall become null and void. Not later than 10 days after
his approval of said plans, the City Engineer shall send to the
Board, in duplicate, an estimate of the cost of construction of said
improvements in accordance with the approved plans. The Board
shall send one copy of said estimate to the subdivider and retain
the other copy. A performance bond in the amount specified in
said estimate shall be submitted by the subdivider to the Board
within 30 days from the receipt of said estimate; otherwise said
approval shall become null and void. Said bond shall carry the
condition that the subdivider complete the required improvements
to the satisfaction of the City Engineer within 12 months from the
date of the bond. Said bond may be renewed by the Board upon
application within said twelve-month period and upon the findings
by the Board of such facts as will justify a further extension of
time to complete the required improvements. Should a certificate
of occupancy be issued for a lot on a new street in the plat, and
the subdivider fail to complete the required improvements within
12 months from the issuance of such certificate of occupancy, no
further extension of time under the bond may be granted. Said
(1)
E.
§ A361-9 WINDOW CLEANERS § A361-9
325:1519
bond shall be approved as to sufficiency by the Commissioner of
Development and, after being approved by the Director of Law
as to form, manner of execution and surety, shall be filed by the
Commissioner of Development with the City Clerk.
The subdivider shall complete all required improvements to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer before any building permits are
issued. Said improvements shall be completed within 12 months
from the date of the plat approval; otherwise said approval shall
become null and void unless an extension of time is applied for and
granted by the Board.
(2)
Upon receipt of notification from the City Engineer that the required
improvements have been satisfactorily installed or upon filing of an
approved performance bond with the City Clerk, the Commissioner of
Development and one member of the Board shall sign the original and
one print of the plat as approved by the Board. Such final approval
shall in no way constitute an acceptance by the City of the dedication
of any street, highway, park or other public open space. To secure said
acceptance by the city, the subdivider shall address a written request to
the City Council, in care of the City Clerk.
F.
The approved plat shall be recorded and filed in the County Clerk's
office within 90 days from the date of final approval by the Board;
otherwise said approval shall become null and void. Any plat of five or
more lots shall first be approved by the Department of Public Works
as to water supply, sewerage facilities a before final approval by the
Planning Board.
G.
After filing the plat with the County Clerk's office, the subdivider shall
enter the county file number and date of filing on one lithoprint of the
approved plat on tracing cloth and three black or blue line prints on
white paper, and shall deliver them to the Board, together with one
print of the plat reduced to a scale of 200 feet to the inch and one to
an exact scale of 80 feet to the inch. The Commissioner of Development
shall deliver two prints to the Department of Public Works and the print
at a scale of 80 feet to the inch to the Assessment Bureau.
H.
The subdivider shall secure the assessment lot and house numbers
from the Assessment Bureau and the Department of Public Works,
respectively.
I.
Upon receipt of notification from the Commissioner of Development
that a satisfactory performance bond has been filed with the City Clerk,
the Building Official may issue building permits for lots within the
approved plat, upon determining that the plans and data submitted are
in full compliance with all requirements of the Zoning Ordinance430 and
all other applicable codes and ordinances. (Note: A temporary roadbed
satisfactory to the City Engineer shall be installed from an existing

Upon receipt of notification from the City Engineer that the required
improvements have been satisfactorily installed and that a satisfactory
maintenance bond, approved by the Director of Law, has been filed
with the City Engineer, the Board shall advise the City Clerk that the
performance bond, filed in connection with the approved plat, may be
released.
K.
The Board may require the reservation of land for park, playground
or other recreational purposes where it makes a finding that a proper
case exists for such reservation on sites containing residential units.
Such findings shall include an evaluation of the present and anticipated
future needs for park and recreational facilities in the City based on
projected population growth to which the particular subdivision plat
will contribute. In the event that the Board makes such a finding, the
Board may require dedication of 10% of the gross area or a minimum of
three contiguous acres of open space, whichever is greater, or, where
the Board finds that a suitable park or parks of adequate size to meet
the requirement cannot be properly located on such subdivision plat,
the Board may require a sum of money in lieu thereof in an amount as
set forth in Chapter 133, Fees. In making such determination, the Board
shall assess the size and suitability of land shown on the subdivision
plat which could be possible locations for park or recreational facilities
as well as practical factors, including whether there is a need for
additional facilities in the immediate neighborhood. Any money
required by the Board in lieu of land for park, playground or other
recreational purposes, pursuant to the provisions of this section, shall
be deposited into a trust fund to be used by the City exclusively for
park, playground or other recreational purposes, including the
acquisition of property. [Amended 12-9-2003 by Ord. No. 269-2003]

may exist on future platted lots within the subdivision. If it can be
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Planning Board that retention
basins or extended detention facilities are not practical alternatives,
other methods recommended in the current NYSDEC Stormwater
Management Guidelines, such as reducing the impacts of stormwater
runoff from new development, may be used as substitutes. Substitutes
may also include the use of dry wells, swales, grit and/or oil separators
and filter strips. The basin and all of the necessary appurtenances shall
be as per the Department of Public Works requirements. Where the
Board determines that an oil/grit separator is an acceptable alternative,
said separator shall be constructed to permit access for inspection
and maintenance and the applicant shall submit maintenance reports
together with a signed and notarized certification on a form supplied
by the Building Official twice per year; once between April 15 and May
30 and once between October 15 and November 30, certifying that
the oil/grit separator was inspected and cleaned out during the abovedescribed
time periods and that said separators are in working order.
The applicant shall be further required to post a long-term maintenance
bond with respect to the performance of the maintenance required
herein. If the maintenance bond expires or is used by the City in
order to conduct the required inspection and cleaning in the event of
default by the applicant, then the City may serve an abatement notice
for further expenses incurred by or on behalf of the City pursuant
to the procedures set forth in § 200 of the City Charter. In addition,
the application shall utilize the Westchester County Best Management
Practices Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control to prepare a
Sediment Control Plan acceptable to the Building Official. [Added

[Added 9-24-2002 by L.L. No. 3-2002]
In the event a homeowners' association for a subdivision does not maintain,
repair, and/or replace its sanitary sewer system located on homeowners'
association property, including but not limited to sanitary sewer lines and
pumps located in such system, in accordance with the approved subdivision
plat and/or the requirements of the Westchester County Sanitary Code, and
the public health and safety is at immediate risk by such failure to maintain,
repair, and/or replace, the City and/or its contractors may enter on such
homeowners' association property and abate such condition by providing
such maintenance, repair, and/or replacement as is immediately necessary
to protect the public health and safety, and shall bill the entire cost of such
abatement, including a ten-percent administrative fee, to the homeowners'
association, all in accordance with the notice, hearing, abatement, billing,
and tax lien procedures set forth in Section 200 of the City Charter, except
that the tax lien, if any, shall be placed on and spread equally among all of
the tax lots which belong to the homeowners' association.
Sudden drops or steep change in grade shall be minimized, or
protected by fences, retaining walls or other means, as directed by
the City Engineer in consultation with other City officials having
jurisdiction. [Amended 12-10-1996 by Ord. No. 260-1996]

When the Board or the City Engineer, due to planning considerations
extraneous to the subdivision, requires a standard of improvements
higher than that which is sufficient to serve the subdivision, the amount
of the bond to be posted shall be deemed to be satisfactory if it
adequately covers the cost of improvements which would be normally
required.438

A candidate who wishes to appeal to the Commission from his
rating in one or more or all of the subjects of an examination must
submit such appeal in writing within 20 days after the earliest
date on which his examination papers were made available for his
inspection. Such appeal must show that a manifest error was made
in the original rating. Such appeal shall be considered as opening
all of the candidates' papers for review, whether resulting in a
higher or lower average standing. No change in rating shall be

content of such examination until completion of the testing of
all candidates.
(b)
No examiner, proctor or other person charged with the supervision
of a candidate or group of candidates during an examination shall

who is found by the Commission to have violated the provisions
of this subsection or any similar provision of the rules of any
other civil service jurisdiction within the State of New York shall
be disqualified from appointment to the position for which the
examination is being held and may be disqualified from being a
candidate for any civil service examination for a period of five
years.
(2)
Every candidate who attains a passing mark in an examination as a
whole and who meets the standards prescribed, if any, for separate
subjects or parts of subjects of the examination shall be eligible for
appointment to the position for which he was examined, and his name
shall be entered on the eligible list in the order of his final rating; but if
two or more eligibles receive the same final rating in the examination,
they shall be ranked in accordance with such uniform, impartial
procedure as may be prescribed therefor by the Commission.
A.
The date of the establishment of a list shall be the date fixed therefor by
Commission resolution, and shall be entered on such list. The duration
of all eligible lists shall be fixed by Commission resolution prior to the
establishment of such lists, but shall not be less than one nor more than
four years. The date of establishment of a list and its duration shall be
given to all successful candidates at the time when notice of standing
on the eligible list is given to such candidates. Where the duration of
an eligible list is fixed at less than four years, the Commission may, by
resolution, prior to the expiration date of such list, extend the duration
of the list up to the maximum limitation of four years, provided that
eligibles on such list are notified in writing of the extension of the
eligible list.
B.
Eligible lists shall be open to public inspection at the office of the
Commission. The names of persons who failed to receive a passing
grade on the examination shall not be disclosed to the public.

been made. Commissions shall have power to revoke any eligible list
where the provisions of these rules were not properly or sufficiently
carried out; provided, however, that an eligible list shall not be revoked
except after notice and an opportunity to be heard has been given to
all persons whose names appear thereon. The reasons for such action
shall be recorded in the minutes of the Commission and reported to the
State Civil Service Commission.
The Commission shall determine the eligible list most nearly
appropriate for the position to be filled, and shall certify to the
appointing authority a sufficient number of eligibles from which
selection for appointment may be made. When the name of any eligible
is included in a certification for appointment, the names of all other
eligibles on the list having the same final rating as such eligible shall
likewise be included in such certification.
A.
A certification issued by the Commission to an appointing officer shall
be valid for a period of 30 days from the date of its issuance. After
the expiration of such thirty-day period, no appointment shall be made
except from a new certification.
B.
When an eligible is canvassed for appointment or is offered
appointment in writing, and fails to state his willingness to accept such
appointment within four business days after the mailing of such canvass
or offer, or before the end of the next succeeding business day of such
canvass or offer is sent to him by telegram, he may be considered
ineligible for purposes of making selection for such particular
appointment.
C.
The name of the person declining appointment shall be eliminated
from further certification from the eligible list unless declination is for
one or more of the following reasons: insufficiency of compensation
offered when below minimum of grade of the position for which the
examination was held; location of employment; temporary inability,
physical or otherwise, which must be satisfactorily explained by the
eligible in writing. The Commission shall enter upon the eligible list the
reasons for its action in such cases.
D.
Except as otherwise provided herein, appointment or promotion to a
position in the competitive class shall be made by the selection of a
person on the most nearly appropriate eligible list who is willing to
accept such appointment and whose final rating in the examination is
equal to or higher than the rating of the third highest ranking eligible
on the list indicating willingness to accept such appointment. The term
"ranking" as used herein refers to the order in which the names of
eligibles appear on the eligible list as provided in § 367-12.

approved applicants for the examination, the appointing officer may
nominate to the Commission one of the applicants who may be certified
for appointment to fill the vacancy without further examination,
provided that he has already qualified in an examination of equivalent
character within the last four years from the date of nomination.
Wherever one or more eligibles shall have declined any appointment
offered and an eligible, whose relative standing is lower and who was
reachable on the certification only because of the aforesaid declination,
shall have been appointed to the position, the salary or compensation
of such appointee shall not be increased, except by a service- or a
class-wide increase, within a period of six months after his appointment
beyond that offered to the persons so declining.
G.
An open-competitive, promotion or preferred eligible list shall not be
certified for filling a permanent competitive class vacancy created by
reclassification of a permanently encumbered competitive class
position if appointment or promotion from such list would require the
layoff of a permanent competitive class employee; but this provision
shall not apply if the incumbent whose position was reclassified,
following such reclassification, either refused to take an examination
for such reclassified position or failed to qualify for appointment,
examination or promotion to the reclassified position.
H.
In no case shall any person be eligible to participate in a promotion
examination until he has served at least six months on a permanent
basis in a lower grade position.
A.
Any person who is nominated for noncompetitive examination for
promotion to a position and who fails to pass two successive
examinations for such promotion shall not thereafter be eligible for
employment in such position, except by appointment or promotion from
an eligible list established following competitive examination.

the number of workdays of his absence which, pursuant to this section,
are not considered as time served in the probationary term. Nothing
in this section shall be construed to except a probationer from the
application of § A367-21D.
Report on probationer's service. The probationer's supervisor shall
carefully observe his conduct and performance and, at least two weeks
prior to the end of the probationary term, shall report thereon in
writing to the proper appointing authority. The supervisor shall also,
from time to time during the probationary term, advise the probationer
of his status and progress. A probationer whose services are to be
terminated for unsatisfactory service shall receive written notice at
least one week prior to such termination and, upon request, shall
be granted an interview with the appointing authority or his
representatives.
G.
Restoration to eligible list. A probationer whose employment is
terminated or who resigns before the end of his probationary term
may request that his name be restored to the eligible list from which
he was appointed, provided that such list is still in existence. His
name may be restored to such list if the Commission, in its discretion,
determines that the probationer should be given a second opportunity
for appointment.
H.
Temporary or provisional service in higher level position. When an
employee who has not completed his probationary term is appointed
on a temporary or provisional basis to a higher position, the period of
temporary or provisional service rendered by such employee in such
higher level position may, in the discretion of the appointing authority,
be considered as satisfactory probationary service in his lower position
and may be counted as such in determining the satisfactory completion
of such probationary term. At any time after the expiration of the
minimum period of the probationary term, or the entire probationary
term if it is one of fixed duration, the appointing authority shall, on
request of such probationer, furnish his decision in writing as to
whether or not service in such higher level position shall be considered
as satisfactory probationary service. In the event of an adverse decision
by the appointing authority, such probationer, at his request, shall be
returned to his lower position for sufficient time to permit him to
complete his probationary term. The employment of such a probationer
in his lower position shall not be terminated at the end of his
probationary term on account of unsatisfactory service unless he shall
have actually served in such position, in the aggregate, at least the
minimum period specified for such probationary term or the entire
probationary term if it is one of fixed duration.
I.
Removal during probationary term. Nothing contained in this section
shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect the authority of an
appointing authority pursuant to § 75 of the Civil Service Law, at any
time during the probationary term, to remove a probationer for
incompetency or misconduct.

§ A367-16. Seasonal and trainee appointments.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of these rules, the appointment
or promotion of a police officer shall not become permanent unless
and until he has satisfied such requirements as may be applicable to
him under § 209-q of the General Municipal Law. If a police officer
is promoted to a higher rank for which he has met all requirements
of eligibility for permanent promotion, except training requirements
applicable under § 209-q of the General Municipal Law, he shall be
deemed to be on leave of absence from the lower rank position from
which he was promoted pending completion of such training. During
such period such lower rank position may not be filled except on a
temporary basis. In the event of his failure to complete such training
successfully within the time allowed therefor, he shall be restored to
such lower rank position.
K.
Any employee who is reinstated to a position after a separation of more
than one year, either in his former jurisdiction or in another jurisdiction,
shall serve a new probationary period in the same manner and subject
to the same requirements as apply upon the original appointment to
such position.
L.
Appointment to seasonal positions in competitive class.
Positions in the competitive class where the nature of service is
such that it is not continuous throughout the year, but recurs in
each successive year, except as herein otherwise provided, shall
be designated as seasonal positions and shall be subject to the
provisions of these rules applicable generally to positions in such
class.
(1)
Upon the expiration of the employment season, the names of all
persons employed in such seasonal positions shall be entered upon
a seasonal reemployment list in the order of their first appointment
to the title vacated by them at the expiration of such employment
season. Such seasonal reemployment list shall be certified to the
appointing authority at the commencement of or during the next
employment season, and the persons whose names appear thereon
as still qualified shall be entitled to reemployment in such positions
in the order in which their names appear on such list. Any such
person may be reexamined by the Commission with respect to his
physical fitness for the performance of the duties of the position,
and may be disqualified for reemployment in the same manner,
and for any of the reasons applicable to the disqualification of
an eligible on an eligible list resulting from open-competitive
examination.
(2)
The name of any person on such list who is not reached for
reemployment shall remain on such list and shall be certified, in
the order of the date of his first appointment to such position
during subsequent seasons; provided, however, that the eligibility

§ A367-17. Effect of temporary or provisional appointment on
status of appointee.
for reemployment of any such person shall not continue for a period
longer than three years from the date of his separation from such
seasonal employment. A seasonal reemployment list shall not be
deemed to be a preferred list as provided for in § 81 of the Civil
Service Law.
Trainee positions and appointments. [Amended 12-27-1978]
The period of traineeship for designated positions shall be for
one year after the date of original appointment, except that the
minimum probationary period of 12 weeks must be satisfied before
any trainee position shall mature into a permanent appointment to
the regular position.
(1)
The Civil Service Commission may require that permanent
appointments or promotions to designated positions shall be
conditioned upon the satisfactory completion of a term of service as
a trainee in such a position or in an appropriate lower training title
or the completion of specified training or academic course, or both.
The period of such term of training service shall be prescribed by
the Commission. Upon the satisfactory completion of such training
term and of specified courses, if required, an appointee shall be
entitled to full permanent status in the position for which
appointment was made. Any appointment hereunder shall be
subject to such probationary period as is prescribed in these rules.
Also, the employment of such person may be discontinued if his
conduct, capacity or fitness is not satisfactory or at any time if he
fails to pursue or continue satisfactorily such training or academic
courses as may be required.
(2)
B.
Effect of temporary appointment on eligibility for permanent
appointment. The acceptance by an eligible of a temporary appointment
shall not affect his standing on the eligible list for a permanent
appointment, nor shall the period of temporary service be counted as
part of the probationary service in the event of subsequent permanent
appointment.
A.
Provisional appointment of permanent employee. When a permanent
competitive class employee is given a provisional appointment to
another competitive class position in the same department or agency,
the position thus vacated by him shall not be filled on other than a
temporary basis pending his reinstatement thereto upon failure of his
provisional appointment to mature into permanent appointment.
B.
Successive provisional appointments. No provisional employee who has
failed the examination for permanent appointment on two occasions,
or refused to take such examination, shall be given another provisional
appointment in the same position.
C.
§ A367-16 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § A367-17
325:1546
§ A367-18. Transfers.
Contingent permanent appointments. A position left temporarily vacant
by the leave of absence of the permanent incumbent may be filled, at
the discretion of the appointing authority, by a contingent permanent
appointment through the use of an open-competitive or promotion
eligible list. Any person appointed on a contingent permanent basis
shall have all the rights and benefits of a permanent competitive class
employee subject to the following limitations: [Added 2-14-1979;
amended 10-17-1995 by Ord. No. 228-1995]
Probationary period. All appointments under this rule shall be
required to complete the probationary period for original
appointment or promotion as prescribed in this rule.
(1)
Return of incumbents. In the event of a layoff or if the permanent
incumbent returns from a leave of absence, persons holding
positions on a contingent permanent basis shall be displaced before
any persons holding permanent status in the same title regardless
of total seniority. In the event that more than one position in
the same title is held by persons having contingent permanent
appointments, displacement among those persons shall be based
on the inverse order of their contingent permanent appointments.
(2)
Preferred list. Upon displacement, if the contingent permanent
appointee was appointed from a promotion eligible list, he/she shall
be restored to his/her permanent position and have his/her name
placed on a preferred eligible list for certification as a mandatory
list only to the department or agency in which the contingent
permanent appointment was made. If the contingent permanent
appointee was appointed from an open-competitive eligible list and
does not have a permanent position to return to, he/she shall have
his/her name placed on a preferred eligible list for certification
as a mandatory list in the civil decision in which the contingent
permanent appointment was made.
(3)
Seniority. When a contingent permanent appointment matures into
a permanent appointment, the date of permanent service shall be
the date of the original contingent permanent appointment.
(4)
D.
Transfer of eligibility for permanent appointment. Upon the written
request of an individual and the prospective appointing authority, and
subject to the approval of the Commission, any individual serving in
a competitive class position as a permanent appointee may be
permanently appointed to another competitive class position, subject
to these rules, without further competitive examination, provided that:
[Amended effective 10-12-1988]
There is no preferred list appropriate for filling the position to
which appointment is sought containing the name of an eligible
willing to accept appointment.
(1)
A.
§ A367-17 WINDOW CLEANERS § A367-18
325:1547
There is no departmental promotion list for the position to which
appointment is sought containing the names of three or more
eligibles willing to accept appointment.
(2)
Scope and qualifications of examinations.
The Commission determines that the examinations' scopes and
qualifications for the positions held and to which appointment
is sought are identical; or
(a)
When the examinations' scopes and qualifications are not
identical, the New York State Department of Civil Service has
determined that the examination for the position held involved
or would involve essential tests and qualifications the same as
or greater than those of the position to which appointment is
sought.
(b)
(3)
The Commission has determined that such appointment is for the
good of the service.
(4)
Transfers between state and local positions.
A transfer may be made from a position in the state service to
a position subject to these rules, provided that the prospective
transferee meets the residence requirements, if any, applicable to
the position to which transfer is sought.
(1)
A transfer may be made from a position subject to these rules to
a position in the service of the state, provided that the prospective
transferee was, at or subsequent to the time of original
appointment in an agency subject to these rules, eligible for
certification and appointment to the position in the state service to
which transfer is sought.
(2)
A transfer pursuant to this section shall require the approval of
the State Civil Service Department and the Municipal Civil Service
Commission having jurisdiction over the local position to or from
which transfer is made.
(3)
B.
Transfers pursuant to reciprocal rules.
This section shall apply to transfers between positions subject to
these rules and positions in a civil division under the jurisdiction
of the State Civil Service Department or under the jurisdiction
of a municipal commission which had adopted a reciprocal rule
permitting transfers of employees to and from other governmental
jurisdictions.
(1)
A transfer may be made pursuant to this section, provided that:
The prospective transferee holds a position to which he was
appointed from an eligible list resulting from an examination
prepared and rated by the State Civil Service Department;
(a)
(2)
C.
§ A367-18 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § A367-18
325:1548
§ A367-19. Reinstatement.
Such examination is or would be appropriate for filling the
position to which transfer is sought;
(b)
Such person meets applicable residence requirements, if any,
for the position to which transfer is sought; and
(c)
Such person at any time would have been eligible and
reachable for appointment to the position to which transfer
is sought from an eligible list resulting from an examination
having the same or less restrictive residence requirements
than those applicable, at the time of transfer, to the position to
which transfer is sought.
(d)
Any person holding a permanent appointment in a competitive
class position in the service of a civil division may be transferred
to a similar position in another civil division having qualifications
and examination requirements similar to or lower than the position
then held by such person, as determined by the State Civil Service
Department, provided that a competitive examination for the latter
position in which such person was eligible to compete has failed to
produce sufficient eligibles to fill vacancies in the civil division to
which transfer is sought.
(3)
Any transfer pursuant to this reciprocal rule shall require the
approval of the State Civil Service Department and the respective
municipal commissions having jurisdiction over the positions from
which and to which transfer is sought.
(4)
A permanent employee who has resigned from his position may be
reinstated without examination within one year from the date of such
resignation in the position from which he resigned, if then vacant,
or in any vacant position to which he was eligible for transfer or
reassignment. In computing the one-year period within which a person
may be reinstated after the resignation, the day the resignation takes
effect, any time spent in active service in the military or naval forces
of the United States or of the State of New York and any time served
in another position in the civil service of the same municipality shall
not be considered. In an exceptional case, the Commission may, for
good cause shown and where the interests of the government would be
served, waive the provisions of this rule to permit the reinstatement of
a person to his former position more than one year after resignation;
provided, however, that such a waiver to permit reinstatement more
than three years after resignation shall be subject to approval of the
State Civil Service Commission. For the purpose of this rule, where
an employee on leave of absence resigns, such resignation shall be
deemed effective as of the date of the commencement of such leave.
A.
B. Refusal or failure to accept reinstatement from preferred list.
§ A367-18 WINDOW CLEANERS § A367-19
325:1549
§ A367-20. Leaves of absence.
Relinquishment of eligibility for reinstatement. The failure or
refusal of a person on a preferred list, after reasonable notice,
to accept reinstatement therefrom to his former position, or any
similar position in the same salary grade for which such list is
certified, shall be deemed to be a relinquishment of his eligibility
for reinstatement, and his name shall thereupon be stricken from
such preferred list. The name of such person may be restored to
such preferred list, and certified to fill such appropriate vacancies
as may thereafter occur, only upon the request of such person and
his submission of reasons satisfactory to the Commission for his
previous failure or refusal to accept reinstatement.
(1)
Effect of refusal to accept reinstatement to lower grade position.
A person on a preferred list shall not be deemed to relinquish his
eligibility for reinstatement therefrom by reason of his failure or
refusal to accept reinstatement to a position in a lower salary grade
than the position from which he was suspended or demoted. The
name of such person may be withheld from further certification for
reinstatement to a position in the same or a lower salary grade than
the position to which he failed or refused to accept reinstatement.
(2)
Restoration to eligibility for reinstatement not to affect previous
appointments. The restoration of the name of a person to a
preferred list, or his restoration to eligibility for certification
therefrom to positions in a lower salary grade than his former
position, shall not invalidate or in any manner adversely affect
any appointment, promotion, reinstatement or demotion previously
made to any position to which such person would otherwise have
been eligible for reinstatement from such preferred list.
(3)
A leave of absence without pay, not to exceed one year, may be granted
to any employee by an appointing officer. Notice of such leave of
absence shall be given to the Commission. Where a leave of absence
without pay has been granted for a period which aggregates one year,
a further leave of absence without pay shall not be granted unless the
employee returns to his position and serves continuously therein for
three months immediately preceding the subsequent leave of absence.
Notice of such subsequent leave of absence shall also be given to
the Commission. Absence on leave for more than one year shall be
deemed the equivalent of a resignation from the service upon the date
of commencement of such absence, except as provided in Subsection B
of this rule.
A.
In an exceptional case, the Commission may, for good cause shown,
waive the provisions of this rule to permit an extension of the leave
of absence for an additional one-year period. In no case may such
leave of absence exceed in aggregate two years from the date of
commencement of the leave.
B.
§ A367-19 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § A367-20
325:1550
§ A367-21. Resignation.
A leave of absence without pay, not to exceed four years, shall be
granted by an appointing officer to an employee who is a veteran of
the Armed Forces of the United States, provided that such a leave of
absence is for the purpose of taking courses under the educational
benefits provided for in Title 38, United States Code, or under a New
York State Board of Regents War Service Scholarship, Education Law,
§ 614. An employee taking such a leave shall be reinstated to his
position, provided that he makes application for such reinstatement
within 60 days after the termination of his courses of study.
C.
Whenever an employee is to be terminated under § 73 of the Civil
Service Law following leave of absence occasioned by ordinary
disability or under § 71 following exhaustion or termination of workers'
compensation leave, he/she must be afforded an opportunity for a
hearing to contest the decision before such termination is to take effect.
[Added 3-6-1991]
D.
Resignation in writing. Except as otherwise provided herein, every
resignation shall be in writing.
A.
Effective date. If no effective date is specified in a resignation, it shall
take effect upon delivery to or filing in the office of the appointing
authority. If an effective date is specified in a resignation, it shall take
effect on such specified date. However, if a resignation is submitted
while the employee is on leave of absence without pay, such resignation,
for the purpose of determining eligibility for reinstatement, shall be
deemed to be effective as of the date of the commencement of such
absence. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, when charges
of incompetency or misconduct have been or are about to be filed
against an employee, the appointing authority may elect to disregard
a resignation filed by such employee and to prosecute such charges;
and, in the event that such employee is found guilty of such charges
and dismissed from the service, his termination shall be recorded as a
dismissal rather than as a resignation.
B.
Withdrawal or amendment. A resignation may not be withdrawn,
canceled or amended after it is delivered to the appointing authority,
without the consent of the appointing authority.
C.
Unauthorized absence; when deemed a resignation. When an employee
is absent without leave and without an explanation therefor for a period
of 10 workdays, such absence shall be deemed to constitute a
resignation effective on the date of the commencement of such
absence. The failure of an employee to return to his position within 10
workdays following the expiration of a leave of absence, or extension
thereof, without submitting an explanation therefor within such ten-day
period shall constitute a resignation which, for purposes of determining
eligibility for reinstatement, shall be deemed to be effective as of the
date of the commencement of such leave of absence. Nothing herein

For the purpose of certification of payrolls and to enable the Commission
to keep an official roster of the classified service as required by law, each
appointing officer, from time to time, and upon the date of the official action
in each case, shall report to the Commission as follows:
§ A367-23. Certification of payrolls.
shall be deemed to excuse the unauthorized absence of an employee or
his failure to return to his position upon the expiration of an authorized
leave of absence, and any such failure may be regarded as misconduct
in an appropriate disciplinary proceeding.
Voluntary demotion of permanent competitive employee. An employee
who voluntarily elects to relinquish his permanent competitive class
status to a position and accept a demotion must deliver a statement
of relinquishment to the appointing authority. Upon receipt of the
statement of relinquishment by the appointing authority, the employee
may be reinstated to any vacant lower salary level position for which
he is eligible for such reinstatement as provided in these rules. Such
statement of relinquishment shall not take effect until the employee is
reinstated to the lower level position.

Every appointment or employment, whether probationary, temporary or
otherwise, in the classified service, with the date of commencement of

§ A367-24. Classification plan.
Extended certifications. The Commission may certify the employment of
a person for a limited or extended period. No further certification shall
be necessary for the payment of salary or compensation to such person,
so long as his title and salary grade remain unchanged and during such
stated period, except as to the first payment for services in each fiscal
year and, if required by the Commission, the first payment for services
in the second half of each fiscal year. Nothing herein shall be construed
to prevent or preclude the Commission from terminating or rescinding
a certification at any time by giving notice thereof to the appropriate
fiscal or disbursing officer.
A.
Temporary certifications. When the name of any person is first
submitted for certification following his appointment, reinstatement,
promotion, transfer or other change in status, and the Commission
requires further information or time to enable it to make a final
determination thereon, the Commission may certify such person
temporarily pending such final determination. In such event the
Commission shall immediately request the necessary additional
information from the appointing authority, who shall furnish it
forthwith. If such information is not furnished promptly, or if the
Commission finds, following receipt of such information, that the
employment of such person is not in accordance with the law and
rules, the Commission shall immediately terminate such certification by
notice to the appropriate fiscal or disbursing officer.
B.
Refusal or termination of certification. Upon satisfactory evidence of
intention to evade the provisions of the law and of these rules in
assigning any employee to perform duties other than those for which
he was examined and certified or under any title not appropriate to
the duties to be performed, the Commission shall refuse certification or
terminate a certification previously made and then in force.
C.
Definitions. For the purpose of this rule, the following definitions shall
apply:
ALLOCATION — The assignment of a position to an appropriate class
as determined by the duties, responsibilities and minimum qualification
requirements of the position.
CLASS — One or more positions sufficiently similar with respect to
duties and responsibilities to be designated by a single descriptive title
and treated as a unit for the purpose of recruiting, establishing salary
ranges and administering other personnel functions.
CLASS SPECIFICATION — A formal written statement of the class
which defines the general character and scope of the duties and
responsibilities of positions in the class, lists typical or illustrative
examples of work of positions in the class, enumerates the knowledge,
skills and abilities required for successful performance of the work and
A.
§ A367-23 WINDOW CLEANERS § A367-24
325:1553
states required minimum experience and training for positions in the
class.
CLASS TITLE — The designation given under these rules to a class and
to each position allocated to such class.
RECLASSIFICATION — The reallocation of a position from one class to
another because of a permanent and material change of the duties of
that position.
The Commission shall prepare and maintain a list of class titles and
class specifications for all positions in the classified service of the civil
division and shall allocate all such positions to an appropriate class.
B.
Classification of vacant positions. The appointing officer shall file a
prescribed form with the Commission when a classified position which
has or is about to become vacant is to be filled. Such form shall
contain a detailed description of the duties and responsibilities of the
position to be filled and a statement of suggested minimum entrance
qualifications for the position. After an analysis of the position
description, the Commission shall allocate the position to an
appropriate class or, if no appropriate class exists, shall create a new
class and prepare a class specification for such position.
C.
Classification of new positions. The appointing officer shall file a
prescribed form with the Commission when a new position is to be
created. Such form shall contain a detailed description of the duties and
responsibilities of the position to be filled and a statement of suggested
minimum entrance qualifications for the position. After an analysis of
the position description, the Commission shall allocate the position to
an appropriate class, or if no appropriate class exists, shall create a new
class and prepare a class specification for such new class.
D.
Reclassification. The appointing officer shall file a prescribed form
with the Commission whenever a permanent and material change is
made in the duties and responsibilities of any position. Such form shall
clearly describe in detail the changes which have been made in the
duties of the position. After an analysis of the changes in the duties
and responsibilities of the position, the Commission shall allocate the
position to an appropriate class, or if no appropriate class exists, shall
create a new class and prepare a class specification for such position.
E.
Notice and appeals. Any appointing officer may make application for
the classification or reclassification of any position in his department,
or any employee in the classified service may apply for a reclassification
of his position. Such application must set forth reasons in support of
the requested reclassification, and must show changes in the duties and
responsibilities of the position since the last determination with respect
to its classification. The Commission shall give reasonable notice of any
proposal or application for a change in classification to the appointing
officer and to the employee or employees affected thereby. Any person
desiring to submit facts orally or in writing in connection with the

No question in any examination or application or other proceeding by the
Commission or its examiners shall be so framed as to elicit information
concerning, nor shall any other attempt be made to ascertain the political
opinions or affiliations of any applicant, competitor or eligible, and all
disclosures thereof shall be discountenanced by the Commission and its
examiners. No discrimination shall be exercised, threatened or promised
against or in favor of any applicant, competitor or eligible because of his
political opinions or affiliation. Nothing in this section shall prevent proper
inquiry as to membership in subversive organizations.
§ A367-26. Layoff of competitive class employees.
reclassification of any position shall be afforded reasonable opportunity
to do so. The Commission shall then determine the proper allocation
of the position. No employee, either by classification or reclassification,
change of title or otherwise, shall be promoted, demoted, transferred,
suspended or reinstated except in accordance with the provisions of the
Civil Service Law and these rules.445
For the purpose of this rule, the following terms shall mean:
DIRECT LINE OF PROMOTION — Shall be strictly construed in that,
in order to be considered as "direct line," all titles must have the same
generic root.
LAYOFF UNIT — Each department of a county, city, town, village, each
school district and each special district. Authorities and community
colleges shall be deemed to be separate civil divisions.
NEXT LOWER OCCUPIED TITLE — The title in direct line of promotion
immediately below the title from which the incumbent is suspended or
demoted, unless no one is serving in that title in that layoff unit, in
which case it shall be the closest lower title in direct line of promotion
in that layoff unit in which one or more persons do serve.
PERMANENT SERVICE —
"Permanent service" shall start on that date of the incumbent's
original appointment on a permanent basis in the classified service;
however, in the case of disabled veterans, the date of original
permanent appointment is considered to be 60 months earlier
than the actual date; while nondisabled veterans are considered to
have been appointed 30 months earlier than their actual date of
appointment. For the purposes of this rule, the definition of what
constitutes a veteran or disabled veteran is contained in § 85 of the
Civil Service Law.

§ A367-24 WINDOW CLEANERS § A367-26
325:1555
SATISFACTORY SERVICE — Service by an employee during which he
did not receive an unsatisfactory performance rating and was not found
guilty of misconduct or incompetency pursuant to § 75 of the Civil
Service law which resulted in the imposition of any of the following
penalties upon such employee:
A resignation followed by a reinstatement or reappointment more
than one year subsequent to the resignation constitutes a break in
service. The original appointment date is to be determined from the
date of reemployment; the prior service would not count.
(2)
Temporary or provisional service preceding the original permanent
appointment does not count. However, temporary or provisional
employment immediately preceded and followed by permanent
classified service employment does not interrupt continuous
service.
(3)
The "permanent service" of any employee who was transferred
from another civil division shall start on the date of his original
permanent appointment in the classified service in the other civil
division.
(4)
If an employee was covered-in to a classified position upon
acquisition by a civil division of an agency in which he was
employed, his seniority begins on the effective date of the cover-in.
As between that employee and others covered-in on the same date,
they shall have the seniority held by them as among themselves in
the agency before the cover-in.
(5)
(1) Dismissal from the service.
(2) Suspension without pay for a period exceeding one month.
(3) Demotion in grade and title.
Suspension.
When an occupied position in the competitive class is abolished,
suspension is to be made from among those employees holding the
same title in the same layoff unit as the abolished position.
(1)
Among permanent employees, the order of suspension is the
inverse of the order of their original permanent appointments in
the classified service. See above definition of "permanent service"
for veterans and disabled veterans. An exception to this rule is
that the blind have absolute retention rights, but only in their job
status. A blind person may not back-date his permanent service
if he also happens to be either a veteran or disabled veteran. A
person is considered blind if he is so certified by the Commission
for the Visually Handicapped of the New York State Social Services
Department.
(2)
B.
§ A367-26 NEW ROCHELLE CODE § A367-26
325:1556
When two or more permanent incumbents of positions in a specific
title are suspended, demoted or displaced at the same time, the
order in which they shall be entitled to displace shall be determined
by their respective retention standing, with those having the
greater retention standing entitled to displace first.
(3)
When several employees were originally appointed on a permanent
basis on the same day, their retention rights shall be determined
by their rank on the eligible list from which they were appointed;
that person having the highest rank having greater retention rights
over those having lower ranks.
(4)
All temporary, provisional and contingent permanent employees
occupying these positions must be let go before any permanent
employee is suspended from such positions.
(5)
Probationary employees occupying such positions in the same title
must also be suspended before any permanent employee in the
layoff unit in that title who has completed his probationary period.
Probationary employees do, however, have superior retention
rights to those of contingent permanent, temporary and provisional
employees.
(6)
The order of suspension among probationary employees shall
follow the same principles as that among permanent employees.
(7)
Vertical bumping.
Vertical bumping occurs when an employee in a specific title to
which there is a direct line of promotion, who is himself suspended
or displaced, displaces an employee in the next lower occupied
title in direct line of promotion in the same layoff unit having the
least seniority if the employee who seeks to displace has greater
retention standing.
(1)
Where the layoff involved more than one position in a title, the
order of displacement will be the inverse of the order of
suspension. That is, the most senior of the suspended employees
will be the first to displace. This shall apply to both vertical
bumping and retreat.
(2)
If an employee refuses to displace a junior incumbent, he must
be laid off. This, however, does not protect the junior incumbent
from being compared in retention standing with other incumbents
if other positions at the higher level are being abolished.
(3)
When a next lower title has been occupied by means of
displacement, regardless of when the displacement into the title
has occurred, it is considered to be occupied for further
displacement purposes; however a next lower title which has all of
its positions abolished at the same time as positions are abolished
at the higher level cannot be considered as occupied. A title which
(4)
C.
§ A367-26 WINDOW CLEANERS § A367-26
325:1557
is occupied by an incumbent, temporary, provisional, contingent
permanent, probationary or permanent is considered occupied for
the purposes of this section.
Retreat.
Retreat occurs when and only when there is no lower occupied
position in direct line of promotion at any level.
(1)
An employee may retreat by displacing the incumbent with the
least retention right who is serving in a position in the title in
which the displacing incumbent last served on a permanent basis
prior to service in the title from which he is currently suspended
or displaced. Retreat may only occur where the position in the
title formerly held by the displacing incumbent is occupied in the
competitive class, in the same layoff unit and at a lower salary
grade; the service of the displacing incumbent while in the former
title must have been satisfactory, and the junior incumbent must
have less retention standing than the displacing incumbent.
(2)
The service of the displacing incumbent in the title to which he is
retreating need not have been in the same layoff unit as the one
from which he is displaced.
(3)
An employee may also displace by retreat to a position in a title
he last served on a permanent basis although he had intervening
service in other titles as long as his service in each of the
intervening titles was on other than a permanent basis. He may
also displace by retreat to a position which does not count in the
computation of his continuous service.
(4)
Where a title change has been effected to better describe the duties
of a position but the duties have not substantially changed since
the suspended employee last served in that title, the new title will,
for retreat purposes, be deemed to be the former title.
(5)
D.
An employee who refuses to accept an appointment afforded by
displacement for whatever reason waives all rights regarding the
displacement; however, this employee's name will be entered on an
appropriate preferred list.
E.
Preferred list standing for competitive class employees on and after
October 1, 1972, shall be as follows:
On and after October 1, 1972, those employees whose positions
were abolished prior to that date and who therefore had their
standing on the preferred list determined by the date of their
original appointment on a permanent basis in the competitive class
shall retain among themselves such preferred list standing,
including the preferences to which they were entitled as blind,
disabled veterans and nondisabled veterans.

Disposition List
Chapter DL
DISPOSITION LIST
Blind employees whose positions are abolished on or after October
1, 1972, shall have their preferred list standing determined by the
date of their original appointment on a permanent basis in the
classified service, whether or not they are also disabled veterans
or nondisabled veterans; provided, however, that the blind shall
be granted absolute preference on the preferred list over all other
employees except those disabled veterans and blind employees
whose positions were abolished prior to October 1, 1972, with
whose names theirs shall be interfiled.
(2)
Disabled veterans whose positions are abolished on or after
October 1, 1972, shall have their preferred list standing
determined by the date of their original appointment on a
permanent basis in the classified service; provided, however, that
the date of such original appointment shall be deemed to be 60
months earlier than the actual date, determined in accordance with
§ 30 of the General Construction Law.
(3)
Nondisabled veterans whose positions are abolished on or after
October 1, 1972, shall have their preferred list standing
determined by the date of their original appointment on a
permanent basis in the classified service; provided, however, that
the date of such original appointment shall be deemed to be 30
months earlier than the actual date, determined in accordance with
§ 30 of the General Construction Law.
(4)
Nonveterans whose positions are abolished on or after October 1,
1972, shall have their preferred list standing determined by the
date of their original appointment on a permanent basis in the
classified service.
(5)
The names of all persons encompassed by Subsection F(3), (4) and
(5) above whose positions are abolished on or after October 1,
1972, shall be interfiled on the preferred list with the names of
all nonveterans whose positions were abolished prior to October 1,
1972.
(6)
An appointing authority may take such steps as it may deem necessary
in order to secure binding written commitments in advance of
suspension, demotion or displacement from employees potentially
affected by such suspension, demotion or displacement as to their
willingness to accept reassignment or displacement.

DOWNTOWN OVERLAY ZONES INTENT & PURPOSE
City of New Rochelle
SECTION 331- 175.01 RESERVED
SECTION 331- 175.02 INTENT AND PURPOSE
A. This Article regulates the location, design, occupancy,
and use of structures and the use of land within the area
known as the " Downtown Overlay Zones" ( hereinafter
DOZ") within the City of New Rochelle.
B. This Article is intended to promote the health, safety and
general welfare of the City by creating a holistic and
comprehensive economic development strategy that
utilizes the principles of social, economic and environmental responsibility to re- establish the downtown as a
center of vibrancy within a mixed- use, transit oriented
setting. This Article is intended to create an opportunity
for a more economically successful and environmentally
responsible City and downtown with a more harmonious and pedestrian -oriented public realm than can be
achieved under the regulations in the underlying zoning
in effect at the time of adoption of this Article.
C. The primary purpose of this Article is to institute a legally
enforceable form -based code within the DOZ, based upon
the City of New Rochelle Comprehensive Plan adopted
on July 30, 1996 ( hereinafter " the Comprehensive
Plan"), the Final Generic Impact Statement ( hereinafter
the FGEIS) dated XXXX, and the Findings Statement
prepared for the Downtown Overlay Zone, adopted on
XXXX, in connection thereto. This Article establishes
development rules and procedures that will result in a
compact and walkable transit -oriented mixed- use development in the Downtown Overlay Zone area.

organized by Downtown Overlay Zone Districts as
further described in Section 331- 175. 04 through Section

Part 3 Determination ofSignificance
For every question in Part 2 that was answered " moderate to large impact may occur", or ifthere is a need to explain why a
particular element ofthe proposed action may or will not result in a significant adverse environmental impact, please
complete Part 3. Part 3 should, in sufficient detail, identify the impact, including any measures or design elements that
have been included by the project sponsor to avoid or reduce impacts. Part 3 should also explain how the lead agency determined that the impact may or will not be significant. Each potential impact should be assessed considering its setting, probability ofoccurring, duration, irreversibility, geographic scope and magnitude. Also consider the potential for shortterm, long-term and cumulative impacts.
As shown in parts one and two of this environmental assessment form, the proposed zoning text amendment will
have no adverse impact on the environment. The MUFE district currently permits a variety of uses. As a special
permit use, with certain conditions applied, this type of use can be accommodated within the MUFE district in a
manner that is in keeping with the existing zoning and prior environmental review.
Check this box ifyou have determined, based on the information and analysis above, and any supporting documentation,
that the proposed action may result in one or more potentially large or significant adverse impacts and an
environmental impact statement is required.

Dear Ms. Oliveros:
6. b
The Westchester County Planning Board has received a proposed zoning amendment to allow dance
studios, martial arts studios, aerobic exercise studios and health clubs to be located at the ground floor in the DB — Downtown Business District. These uses are currently permitted, but only above the ground floor.
We have no objection to the New Rochelle City Council assuming Lead Agency status for this review.
We have reviewed this matter under the provisions of Section 239 L, M and N of the General
Municipal Law and Section 277.61 of the County Administrative Code and find this to be a matter for
local determination in accordance with the City' s planning and zoning policies.
Please inform us of the City' s decision so that we can make it a part ofthe record.
Thank you for calling this matter to our attention.

Part 3 Determination ofSignificance
For every question in Part 2 that was answered " moderate to large impact may occur", or ifthere is a need to explain why a
particular element ofthe proposed action may or will not result in a significant adverse environmental impact, please
complete Part 3. Part 3 should, in sufficient detail, identify the impact, including any measures or design elements that
have been included by the project sponsor to avoid or reduce impacts. Part 3 should also explain how the lead agency determined that the impact may or will not be significant. Each potential impact should be assessed considering its setting, probability ofoccurring, duration, irreversibility, geographic scope and magnitude. Also consider the potential for short- term, long-term and cumulative impacts.
The proposed zoning text amendment, allowing electric vehicle charging stations as a special permit use in
commercial districts, will have no adverse impact on the environment. Instead, this change will encourage a more efficient use of land, to foster more sustainable mobility.
