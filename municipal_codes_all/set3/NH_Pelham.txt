307-48-1-3 Applicability
This Ordinance shall apply to all water, pollutants, or other flows entering storm drain systems, wetlands, surface waters, or ground water generated from any public or private, developed or undeveloped lands within the Town of Pelham, unless explicitly exempted by the Town. This Ordinance applies to all discharges including construction activity.
307-48-1-4 Responsibility
It is the responsibility of the Town, property and facility owners, property and facility users, and all citizens to act in a way to prevent pollution, protect natural resources, and safeguard public health and safety.
All property and facility owners and their assigns or lessees have the responsibility to manage and discharge non-storm water flows legally and in compliance with all federal, state, and local ordinances, regulations, rules, and laws. All property and facility owners and their assigns or lessees have the responsibility to maintain and operate storm water devices and systems under their control in a manner consistent with all federal, state, and local ordinances, regulations, rules, and laws, and to ensure continuous and lawful functioning.
Every person or entity (or person or entity's lessee) owning property through which a watercourse passes shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, obstructions, or other matter that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
The Town is responsible for oversight of Pelham’s storm drain systems, surface waters, and ground water to ensure that the discharge of pollutants is prohibited and to provide a mechanism to regulate and enforce the prohibitions.
The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this Ordinance are minimum standards; therefore, this Ordinance does not intend nor imply that compliance by any person or entity will ensure that there will be no contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants.
307-48-1-5 Authority
The Town of Pelham shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this Ordinance. Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the Town may be delegated in writing by the Town to other persons or entities acting in the beneficial interest of or in the employ of the Town.
5.1 Access to Property and Facility
To the extent permitted by law, this Ordinance provides authorization for the Town of Pelham to access properties and facilities to act on the detection and elimination of suspected and known illicit discharges including, but not limited to, inspection, monitoring, and enforcement. Unless determined by the Town to present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to public health or welfare, no entry shall be
Town of Pelham
Zoning Ordinance Page 33
made without due notice and the consent of the property/facility owner or their assigns/lessees.
1. The Town shall be permitted to enter and inspect property and facilities subject to regulation under this Ordinance as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this Ordinance. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into the premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the Town.
2. Property owners and facility operators shall allow the Town ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, and if applicable, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state or federal law.
3. The Town shall have the right to set up on any property or facility such devices as are necessary, in the opinion of the Town, to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of storm water discharge.
4. The Town has the right to require dischargers to install monitoring equipment as necessary.

Existing Personal Wireless Service Structures: A personal wireless service facility may locate, subject to the issuance of a building permit that includes review by the Director of Planning, on any existing personal wireless service structure, including any guyed tower, lattice tower, mast tower or monopole tower in existence prior to the adoption of this ordinance so long as co-location complies with any approved site plan. All the performance standards stated in this ordinance shall be met. This provision shall apply only so long as the height of the existing tower structure is not increased, a security barrier already exists, and the area of the security barrier is not increased. All other sitings shall require site plan review and approval by the Planning Board.
2. Existing Structures: A personal wireless service facility may locate, subject to the provisions of this ordinance and site plan review, on an existing structure other than on an existing personal wireless service or tower structure.
3. Telecommunications Overlay Zone: A personal wireless service facility may locate within the telecommunications overlay zone, subject to a conditional use permit granted by the Planning Board and site plan review by the Planning Board.

Zoning Ordinance Page 44
Ground mounted personal wireless service facilities shall not project higher than 199 feet in height, unless the facility was greater than 199 feet in height prior to the adoption of this article.
2. Setbacks
All personal wireless service facilities and equipment shelters shall adhere to a front, rear and side setback of 175 feet.
3. Fall Zone
In order to ensure public safety, the minimum distance from the ground mount of a personal wireless service facility to any property line, road, habitable dwelling, business or institutional use or public recreational area shall be 100% of the height of the facility, including any antennas or other appurtenances. This setback is considered the “Fall Zone”. The Planning Board may change the fall zone upon a showing that the technical quality and nature of the facility requires a different fall zone as is otherwise required by this section.
307-59 Performance Standards
A. Visual Impact and Lighting.
Visual impacts are measured on the basis of: change in community scale, as exhibited in relative height, mass or proportion of the personal wireless service facility within its proposed surroundings; new visible elements proposed on a contrasting background; different colors and textures proposed against a contrasting background; and use of materials that are foreign to the existing built environment.
Preservation of the existing developed and natural environments within Pelham are enhancements to the Town. Enhancements are measured on the basis of: conservation of opportunities to maintain community scale, amount and type of landscaping and/or natural vegetation; preservation of view corridors, vistas and view sheds; and continuation of existing colors, textures and materials.
Visibility focuses on eliminating or mitigating the visual impact, and maximizing enhancement of the existing environment.
The requirements in this subsection (A), shall govern the location of all facilities, and the installation of all antennas.
The requirements are as follows:
1. Towers shall be located on sites where the grade/slope and tree cover of the site and surrounding land can be used to decrease any adverse visual impacts.
2. Tower or ground mounts shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, or be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
3. The design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the maximum extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities with the natural setting and built environment. These buildings and facilities shall also be subject to all other Site Plan Review Regulation requirements.
4. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
5. Facilities shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the Planning Board may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.

Zoning Ordinance Page 45
B. Federal Requirements
All facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate facilities and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the owners of the facilities governed by this ordinance shall bring such facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal, in accordance with § VIII, of the facilities, at the owner’s expense through the execution of the posted security required by § VI.
C. Building Codes-Safety Standards
To ensure the structural integrity of facilities and antennas, the owner of a facility shall certify that it is constructed and maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for personal wireless service facilities that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. The owner of the facility shall initially provide proof of structural integrity by report of a structural engineer licensed in New Hampshire and thereafter shall provide certifying reports to the town every five years. All facilities shall be designed and operated in an manner that minimizes the risk of igniting a fire or intensifying one that otherwise occurs. If, upon inspection the Town concludes that a facility fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the facility, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such facility into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such facility into compliance within 30 days, such action shall constitute grounds for the removal, in accordance with Section 307-62, of the facility, at the owners expense through the execution of the posted security required by Section 307-61.
D. Additional Requirements
These requirements shall supersede any and all other applicable standards found elsewhere in Pelham Ordinances or Regulations that are less strict.
1. Landscaping
a. Towers or ground mounted facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the equipment shelter from adjacent residential property and public roads. The standard buffer shall consist of landscaped strip at least 10 feet wide outside the perimeter of the tower compound. Natural vegetation is preferred.
b. In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived entirely.
c. Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large wooded lots, natural growth around the property may be deemed a sufficient buffer.
307-60 Conditional Use Permits
A. General
Unless otherwise provided, all applications under this ordinance shall apply to the Planning Board for Site Plan Review, in accordance with the requirements as provided herein and as provided for in the Site Plan Review Regulations. Applicants for conditional use permits under this ordinance shall also be required to submit the information provided for in this Section.
B. Issuance of Conditional Use Permits
In granting the Conditional Use Permit, the Planning Board may impose conditions to the extent the Board concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed siting on adjoining properties, and to preserve the intent of this ordinance.
1. Procedure on application.
Town of Pelham
Zoning Ordinance Page 46
The Planning Board shall act upon the application in accordance with the procedural requirements of the Site Plan Review Regulations and RSA 676:4.

3. Elements of Conditional Permit: The applicant has the burden of addressing the following:
a. The height of proposed tower or other structure is necessary to provide personal wireless services;
b. The effect of the proximity of the facility to residential development or zones;
c. Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
d. Surrounding topography;
e. Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
f. Design of the facility, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness;
g. Proposed ingress and egress to the site;
h. Availability of suitable existing sites and other structures as discussed herein;
i. Visual impacts on view sheds, ridge lines, and other impacts by means of personal wireless service facility location, tree and foliage clearing and placement of incidental structures; and;
j. Availability of alternative siting locations;
k. All outside storage related to the operation of the personal wireless service facility shall be screened from neighboring view, and shall not emit loud noises or obnoxious gases or fumes. Outdoor storage unrelated to the operation of the personal wireless facility is prohibited.
C. Information Required
Each applicant requesting a Conditional Use Permit under this ordinance shall submit a scaled plan in accordance with the Site Plan Review Regulations and further information including; a scaled elevation view, topography, radio frequency coverage, facility height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses (up to 200’ away from the property line), and any other information deemed necessary by the Planning Board to assess compliance with this ordinance. Furthermore, the applicant shall submit the following prior to any approval by the Board:
1. The applicant shall submit written proof that the proposed use/facility complies with the FCC regulations on radio frequency (RF) exposure guidelines.
2. The applicant shall submit written proof that an evaluation has taken place, as well as the results of such evaluation, satisfying the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) further referenced in applicable FCC rules. If an Environmental Assessment (EA) or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required under the FCC rules and NEPA, submission of the EA or EIS to the Board prior to the beginning of the federal 30 day comment period, and the Town process, shall become part of the application requirements.
3. Each applicant for a facility shall provide to the Planning Board an inventory of all existing facilities that are within the jurisdiction of the Town and those within five miles of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, design of each facility, as well as economic and technological feasibility for co-location on the inventoried facilities. The Planning Board may share such information with other applicants applying for approvals or conditional use permits under this ordinance or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority, provided, however that the Planning Board is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
Town of Pelham
Zoning Ordinance Page 47
If the applicant is proposing to build a new tower or other ground mounted structure, the applicant shall submit written evidence demonstrating that no existing structure can accommodate the applicant’s proposed facility. This evidence will consist of:
a. Substantial Evidence that no existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant’s engineering requirements, provided that a description of the geographic area required is also submitted.
b. Substantial Evidence that existing structures, including towers are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant’s engineering requirements, and why.
c. Substantial Evidence that the existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant’s proposed antenna and related equipment.
d. Substantial Evidence that the applicant’s proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant’s proposed antenna.
e. Substantial Evidence that the fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share the existing tower or structure are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable.
f. Substantial Evidence that the applicant can demonstrate other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
4. The applicant proposing to build a tower or ground mounted structure shall submit an agreement with the Town that allows for the maximum allowance of co-location upon the new structure to the extent such co-location can exist while minimizing adverse impacts noted in I(A). Such statement shall become a Condition to any Approval. This statement shall, at a minimum, require the applicant to supply available co-location for reasonable fees and costs to other telecommunication providers. Failure to provide such an agreement is evidence of the applicant’s unwillingness to cooperate with the orderly and well-planned development of Pelham, and is ground for a Denial.
5. The applicant shall submit the engineering information detailing the size and coverage required for the facility location. The Planning Board may have any submitted information reviewed by a consultant for verification of any claims made by applicant regarding technological limitations and feasibility for alternative locations, or any other matter required by the application. Cost for this review shall be borne by the applicant in accordance with 676:4, I(g).
D. Waivers to Section 307-60
1. General
Where the Board finds that extraordinary hardships, practical difficulties, or unnecessary and unreasonable expense would result from strict compliance with the terms of Section 307-60 or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve waivers to these regulations. The purpose of granting waivers under provisions of these regulations shall be to insure that an applicant is not unduly burdened as opposed to merely inconvenienced by said regulations. The Board shall not approve any waiver(s) unless a majority of those present and voting shall find that all of the following apply:
1. The granting of the waiver will not be detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property and will promote the public interest.
2. The waiver will not, in any manner, vary the provisions of the Pelham Zoning Ordinance, Pelham Master Plan, or Official Maps.
3. Such waiver(s) will substantially secure the objectives, standards and requirements of these regulations.
Town of Pelham
Zoning Ordinance Page 48
4. A particular and identifiable hardship exists or a specific circumstance warrants the granting of a waiver. Factors to be considered in determining the existence of a hardship shall include, but not be limited to:
a. Topography and other site features
b. Availability of alternative site locations
c. Geographic location of property
d. Size/magnitude of project being evaluated and availability of co-location.
2. Conditions
In approving waivers, the Board may impose such conditions as it deems appropriate to substantially secure the objectives of the standards or requirements of these regulations.
3. Procedures
A petition for any such waiver shall be submitted in writing by the applicant with the application for Board review. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the waiver and all of the facts relied upon by the applicant. Failure to submit petition in writing shall require an automatic denial.
4. Variations
Any other variations from Article X, excluding Section 307-60, will require appropriate action from the Board of Adjustment.
307-61 Bonding, Security and Insurance
Recognizing the extremely hazardous situation presented by inadequately maintained or abandoned and unmonitored facilities, the Planning Board shall set the form and amount of security that represents the cost for removal and disposal of abandoned facilities in the event that the facility is abandoned or inadequately maintained and the facility owner is incapable and unwilling to remove or maintain it. Furthermore, the Planning Board shall require the submission of proof of adequate insurance covering accident or damage.
307-62 Removal of Abandoned Antennas and Facilities
Any antenna or facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned and hazardous to the public health and safety. The owner shall remove the abandoned structure within 90 days of receipt of a declaration of abandonment from the Town notifying the owner of such abandonment. A declaration of abandonment shall only be issued following a public hearing, noticed per Town regulations, with notice to abutters and the last known owner/operator of the facility. If the abandoned facility is not removed within 90 days the Town may execute the security and have the facility removed. If there are two or more users of a single facility, this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the facility.
307-63 Enforcement
Enforcement of this section shall be in accordance with Chapter 676 of the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated and Pelham Zoning Ordinance.
307-64 Saving Clause
If any provision of this ordinance is found to be unenforceable or unlawful by a court of competent jurisdiction, the ordinance shall be considered savable and such a finding shall not be construed to invalidate the remainder of the ordinance.

In accordance with NH RSA 674:71-73, The purpose of this ordinance is to expand the mix of affordable housing opportunities throughout the Town by permitting the creation of secondary dwelling residences as an accessory use to existing single-family detached dwellings while maintaining the visual and functional character of single-family residential neighborhoods for the following reasons:
I. There is a growing need for more diverse affordable housing opportunities for the citizens of New Hampshire.
II. Demographic trends are producing more households where adult children wish to give care and support to parents in a semi-independent living arrangement.
III. Elderly and disabled citizens are in need of independent living space for caregivers.
IV. There are many important societal benefits associated with the creation of accessory dwelling residences, including:
(a) Increasing the supply of affordable housing without the need for more infrastructure or further land development.
(b) Benefits for aging homeowners, single parents, recent college graduates who are saddled with significant student loan debt, caregivers, and disabled persons.
(c) Integrating affordable housing into the community with minimal negative impact.
(d) Providing elderly citizens with the opportunity to live in a supportive family environment with both independence and dignity.
Definitions.

Town of Pelham
Zoning Ordinance Page 69
Minimum Setback Requirements Occupied Buildings on Proposed Windmill Property Occupied Buildings on Abutting Property Property Lines of Abutting Property and Utility Lines Public Roads 0 1.5 x Min. 1.1 x Min. 1.5 x Min.
a. Small wind energy systems must meet all setbacks for principal structures for the zoning district in which the system is located.
b. Guy wires used to support the tower are exempt from the small wind energy system setback requirements.
2. Tower: The maximum tower height shall be restricted to 35 feet above the tree canopy within 300 feet of the small wind energy system. In no situation shall the tower height exceed 150 feet.
3. Sound Level: The small wind energy system shall not exceed 60 decibels using the A scale (dBA), as measured at the site property line, except during short-term events such as severe wind storms and utility outages.
4. Shadow Flicker: Small wind energy systems shall be sited in a manner that does not result in significant shadow flicker impacts. Significant shadow flicker impact is considered as more than 30 hours per year on abutting occupied buildings. The applicant has the burden of proving that the shadow flicker will not have significant adverse impact on neighboring or adjacent uses. Potential shadow flicker will be addressed either through siting or mitigation measures.
5. Signs: All signs including flags, streamers and decorative items, both temporary and permanent, are prohibited on the small wind energy system, except for manufacturer identification or appropriate warning signs.
6. Code Compliance: The small wind energy system shall comply with all applicable sections of the New Hampshire State Building Code.

After the 12 months of inoperability, the AHJ or their designee(s) may issue a Notice of Abandonment to the owner of the small wind energy system. The owner shall have the right to respond to the Notice of Abandonment within 30 days from Notice receipt date. After review of the information provided by the owner, the AHJ or their designee(s) shall determine if the small wind energy system has been abandoned.

Section 100 – GENERAL PROVISIONS
100-1 Title
Sections 200 and 300 of this document are entitled Subdivision Regulations and Site Plan Regulations respectively. Taken together, these Sections constitute these Land Use Regulations of the Town of Pelham, New Hampshire
100-2 Effective Date
These Land Use Regulations or any subsequent amendment hereto, shall become effective upon adoption by the Planning Board in accordance with the provisions of RSA 675:6.
100-3 Interpretation, Conflict and Severability
A. Interpretation: Design standards contained in these Land Use Regulations shall be interpreted as minimum requirements and compliance with said minimum requirements shall in no instance obligate the Planning Board to approve any particular application solely on that basis. Only after the Planning Board is fully satisfied that an application complies with these Regulations, shall the application be approved. These Land Use Regulations shall be broadly construed to promote the purposes for which they were adopted and/or amended.
B. Conflict: Pursuant to the provisions of RSA 676:14, if and when any provision of these Land Use Regulations is found to be in conflict with any applicable provision of the Pelham Zoning Ordinance, Building Code, or applicable State Statute or Administrative Rule, that provisions which imposes the greater restriction or higher standard shall prevail.
C. Severability: In the event any Section, paragraph, sentence, term, condition or provision of these Land Use Regulations shall be held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect, impair, or invalidate any other Section, paragraph, sentence, term, condition or provision of the Regulations.
100-4 Review of Developments of Regional Impact
For the purposes described under RSA 36:55 and pursuant to the requirements of RSA 36:56, the Planning Board, upon receipt of an application for approval of any land use permit, shall review
2
such application promptly and determine whether or not in its judgment, the subdivision, site plan, or other form of development proposed could reasonably be construed as having the potential for regional impact as defined under RSA 36:55. In the event the Planning Board determines an application has the potential for regional impact, the Board shall indicate that determination and the reason(s) therefore in its minutes and subsequently undertake procedures described in RSA 36:57 in the review and consideration of said application. In the event the Planning Board does not elect to discuss or vote upon the question as to whether or not a specific application may have the potential for regional impact, such lack of discussion or vote shall be deemed to be a determination on the part of the Planning Board that the application, if approved, would not have the potential for regional impact.
100-5 Scenic Roads
In recognition of the fact that the Town of Pelham may, from time to time, vote to define and designate any existing public highway, or portion thereof, as a Scenic Road pursuant to authority of RSA 231:157, it is recognized that applicants seeking land use permits under these Land Use Regulations, may on occasion, require written consent of the Planning Board in accordance with the provisions of RSA 231:158 prior to performing certain work or constructing specific improvements within the right-of-way of a Scenic Road. In such instances, the Planning Board may, upon request of an applicant, conduct a public hearing required in accordance with the provisions of RSA 231:158, II contemporaneously with any public hearing held in accordance with applicable provisions of these Land Use Regulations.
100-6 Land Affected by Municipal Boundaries
Any application for a land use permit submitted to the Planning Board under these Regulations which contains land situated in more than one municipality of the State of New Hampshire shall be subject to the procedures and requirements of RSA 674:53.

SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Section 200 – GENERAL PROVISIONS
200-1 Title
This chapter shall be known as the “Subdivision Regulations of the Town of Pelham, New Hampshire.”
200-2 Authority, Adoption and Amendment
These Regulations have been adopted in accordance with authority vested in the Town of Pelham Planning Board by Town Meeting vote and the provisions of RSA 674:35 and 674:36, as amended. The Planning may amend, and periodically has amended, these Subdivision Regulations pursuant to RSA 675:6.
200-3 Purpose
In accordance with NH RSA 674:36, the Subdivision Regulations of the Town of Pelham are intended to:
A. Provide against such scattered or premature subdivision of land as would involve danger or injury to health, safety, or prosperity by reason of the lack of water supply, drainage, transportation, schools, fire protection, or other public services, or necessitate the excessive expenditure of public funds or the supply of such services;
B. Provide for the harmonious development of the municipality and its environs;
C. Require the proper arrangement and coordination of streets within subdivisions in relation to other existing or planned streets or with features of the official map of the municipality;
D. Provide for open spaces of adequate proportions;
E. Require suitably located streets of sufficient width to accommodate existing and prospective traffic and to afford adequate light, air and access for firefighting apparatus and equipment to buildings and be coordinated so as to compose a convenient system;
F. Require, in proper cases, that plats showing new streets or narrowing or widening of such streets submitted to the Planning Board for approval shall show a park or parks suitably located for playground or other recreational purposes;
4
G. Require that proposed parks shall be of reasonable size for neighborhood playgrounds or other recreational uses;
H. Require that the land indicated on plats submitted to the Planning Board shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to health;
I. Prescribe minimum areas of lots so as to assure conformance with local zoning ordinances and to assure such additional areas as may be needed for each lot for on-site sanitary facilities;
J. Include provisions which will tend to create conditions favorable to health, safety, convenience or prosperity;
K. Encourage the installation and use of solar, wind, or other renewable energy systems and protect access to energy sources by the regulation of orientation pf streets, lots, and buildings; establishment of maximum building height, minimum set back requirements and limitations on type, height and placement of vegetation; and encouragement of the use of solar sky-space easements under RSA 477;
L. Provide for an efficient and compact subdivision development which promotes the retention and public usage of open space and wildlife habitat, by allowing for village plan alternative subdivision as defined in RSA 674:21 VI;
M. Require innovative land use controls on lands when supported by the master plan; and
N. Include provision for waiver of any portion of the regulations in such cases where, in the opinion of the planning board, strict conformity would pose an unnecessary hardship to the applicant and waiver would not be contrary to the spirit and intent of the regulations.
200-4 Applicability and Enforcement
A. No subdivision of land shall occur, and no land in any subdivision shall be sold or leased, and no streets or utility construction shall commence unless until a subdivision plat, prepared in accordance with the requirements of these Regulations, has been approved and a final plat has been signed by the Chair of the Pelham Planning Board and subsequently recorded at the Hillsborough County Registry of Deeds.
B. Pursuant to RSA 676:16 the Town of Pelham may enjoin any transfer or sale of any land located in a subdivision before a subdivision plat depicting that land has been approved by the Pelham Planning Board, signed by the Chair, and properly recorded at the Hillsborough County Registry of Deeds pursuant to RSA 674:37.
C. In its enforcement of these Regulations, the Town of Pelham shall enjoy all legal rights and remedies afforded to a municipality under New Hampshire Law including, but not limited to the provisions of RSA 676:15 through 676:17-b.
5
D. Notwithstanding these Regulations, any person may, without Planning Board approval, record a plan of the type described in RSA 676:18, II and 676:18-a, provided that no other information is included thereon except as authorized by statute and certified as such in accordance with the provisions of RSA 676:18, III.
200-5 Scattered or Premature Subdivision
Pursuant to the authority of RSA 674:36, II(a) and Section 200-3 of these Subdivision Regulations, the Planning Board may disapprove any application if it finds that it would result in the scattered or premature subdivision of land as would involve endanger or injury to health, safety, or prosperity by reason of lack of water supply, drainage, transportation, schools, fire protection, or other public services, or necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services.
200-6 Off-Site Improvements
In the event the Planning Board finds that a proposed subdivision will create the need for off-site improvements, all or part of which are rationally related to or occasioned by the proposed subdivision; or which will require an excessive expenditure of public funds in order to provide for the same, the Planning Board may impose, as a condition of subdivision approval, a requirement that the applicant install or pay for all or part of the needed off-site improvement(s). When imposing such a requirement, the Planning Board shall consider the degree to which the subdivision will benefit from the completion of the off-site improvement(s) needed. In cases where off-site improvements will benefit other properties, the Planning Board shall determine the amount the applicant shall pay by taking the following into consideration:
1. The character of the area;
2. The extent to which the general public and/or specific public or private properties will benefit by completion of said off-site improvements; and
3. Any other factor(s) which the Planning Board deems appropriate to the establishment of a rational nexus between the needs created by and the special benefits conferred upon the proposed subdivision.
200-7 Waiver Provision
In those instances where the Planning Board finds that strict conformance with one or more certain requirements of these Regulations may not be appropriate or necessary when applied to a specific application, the Planning Board may modify or waive one or more of the requirements of these Regulations pursuant to RSA 674:36, II(n) provided the Board finds, by majority vote, that:
1. Strict conformity would pose an unnecessary hardship to the applicant and the waiver(s) would not be contrary to the spirit and intent of these Regulations; or
6
2. Specific circumstances relative to the subdivision, or conditions of the land in such subdivision, indicate that the waiver will properly carry out the spirit and intent of the Regulations.
The applicant/owner shall make any and all waiver requests in writing and provide sufficient justification supporting each such request for consideration by the Planning Board. In all instances where the Planning Board votes to grant an applicant waivers from one or more requirements of these Regulations, the basis for such waiver(s) shall be recorded in the minutes of the Board’s proceedings; and the Board shall require the applicant include a notation on the final plat acknowledging any and all modifications or waivers granted by the Planning Board.
The requirements in these Regulations pertaining to “Special Flood Hazard Areas” shall not be waived by the Planning Board.
200-8 Appeals
A. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Planning Board made under authority of these Regulations may appeal such decision to Superior Court pursuant to RSA 677:15.
B. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Planning Board concerning subdivision approval or disapproval may appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment if such decision was based upon the terms and conditions of the Pelham Zoning Ordinance pursuant to RSA 676:5, III.

A. In such instances where the Planning Board stipulates that, as a precedent condition of subdivision approval, a performance guarantee be provided by the applicant to serve as financial surety for the successful completion of streets and/or other improvements specified on the subdivision plat, or which are otherwise required under the terms of such approval, or these Regulations, the Town Engineer shall provide the Planning Director with a recommendation as to the amount of such surety. After review and consideration of the Town Engineer’s recommendation, the Planning Director shall establish the final sum of the required performance guarantee.
B. In instances when all or portions of those improvements for which surety is to be given are not reasonably anticipated to be fully complete within a one year of receipt of such surety, the value of the performance guarantee so given may include provision for cost escalation. However, in no case shall Town officials require application of a cost escalation factor of more than 10-percent per year.
C. The Planning Director shall accept a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, cash, or other form of surety which may be acceptable to the Town. In all instances, the form of the instrument of surety provided shall be acceptable to Town Counsel. In all instances, the form of the surety instrument shall specify the term and duration of the surety, include an “automatic call” provision, and acknowledge that the surety shall neither lapse nor terminate until released in writing by the Town of Pelham.
D. In the event improvements for which a performance guarantee has been required remain incomplete or are found to have been completed in an unacceptable manner at the
45
conclusion of the term of the surety, the Town of Pelham shall enjoy the right to call the performance guarantee and utilize the proceeds of the same to cause the required improvements to be completed and/or repaired.
E. As phases or portions of the work for which a performance guarantee has been required are completed, the Planning Director may, upon receipt of a favorable recommendation from the Town Engineer, recommend that the Board of Selectmen vote release a portion of the performance guarantee. In no case shall the performance guarantee sum be released to an amount less than 110-percent of the anticipated cost of completion of all remaining work, or 10-percent of original surety value, which ever is greater.
F. Upon receipt of confirmation from the Town Engineer and Road Agent that all streets or improvements for which a performance guarantee has been given have been satisfactorily completed, the Planning Director may recommend that the Board of Selectmen vote to accept the completed streets or improvements on behalf of the public and release any remaining performance guarantees. Upon affirmative vote of the Board of Selectmen to accept such streets and/or improvements and to release the remaining performance guarantee, the amount of the surety may be reduced to a sum not less than 10-percent of original surety value. This residual surety shall continue to be held by the Town of Pelham as a maintenance guarantee for a period of one additional calendar year and shall serve as a financial guarantee for the repair of latent defects in the work which may become evident within one year of public acceptance. If no evidence of latent defects in the improvements is reported to the Board of Selectmen by the Road Agent within the following one year period, the Board of Selectmen shall vote to release the maintenance guarantee in full.
Section 204-3 Inspection Requirements and Procedures
A. Prior to commencement of construction of streets, utilities, off-site improvements, or other subdivision infrastructure, the owner or his/her contractor shall contact the Planning Director to request a preconstruction conference be scheduled. Upon receipt of such a request, the Planning Director and Town Engineer shall promptly schedule a preconstruction conference, which shall be attended by the Planning Director, Road Agent and Town Engineer, the owner or owner’s representative, the contractor and other parties invited by the owner, Planning Director, or Town Engineer. At the time of the pre-construction conference, the Town Engineer shall review applicable Town construction requirements and procedures with attendees and confirm that all items prerequisite to the commencement of construction have been satisfied.
B. During the construction period, the Town Engineer shall serve as the Planning Board’s field representative observing and reporting to the Planning Director on the progression of the work. During this period, the Town Engineer shall promptly report to the Planning Director and the owner any perceived construction defect or deviation from the terms of the approval of approved project plans. In such instances, the Town Engineer may also offer recommendations for the remedy of such defects or deviations.
46
C. The Town Engineer shall periodically invoice the Planning Department for services during the course of construction; and the Planning Department shall in turn require the owner to reimburse the Board for such costs. In the event the owner fails to reimburse the Planning Department in a timely manner for the cost associated with the Town Engineer’s services, the Planning Director may issue a Stop Work Order which shall not be withdrawn until the Planning Department has been reimbursed in full for the Town Engineer’s services. In the event an owner fails to reimburse the Planning Department for the Town Engineer’s services, the Town of Pelham may call upon any performance guarantee given by the owner to satisfy such costs.
D. If during the construction of a subdivision, changes in the design of streets or other subdivision infrastructure are proposed, the owner shall notify the Town Engineer in advance of proceeding with such change. Upon receipt of a request for a design change, the Town Engineer, in consultation with the Planning Director, shall make a determination as to whether or not the request represents a significant change in the approved plans and specifications. If the Planning Director makes the determination that a requested change is significant, the owner shall not proceed to make such change without the approval of the Planning Board. If the Planning Director makes the determination that a requested change represents a minor field change which will not adversely affect the outcome of the work and will not cause a departure from the requirements of the approved project plans or these Regulations, he/she may approve such change, or in the alternative authorize the Town Engineer to approve such change. In instances where there is uncertainty on the part of the Planning Director and Town Engineer as to whether or not a requested change is significant, they shall refer decision on possible approval of the requested change to the Planning Board.

Section 205 – CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION PROVISIONS
205-1 General
These Conservation Subdivision Provisions of the Subdivisions Regulations were adopted pursuant to authority of Article XV of the Pelham Zoning Ordinance in order to administer and regulate the flexibility that is meant to be an inherent part of the Conservation Subdivision development process. This process is meant to provide applicants with an alternative development approach intended to promote creativity and innovation in land planning. Each tract of land possesses different and unique development characteristics and limitations, and the process of developing a Conservation Subdivision on any particular tract is a function of how innovative subdivision design interacts with the special characteristics and limitations of the site.
The provisions of this Section shall only apply to a subdivision of land through the use of a Special Permit for a Conservation Subdivision under Article XV of the Pelham Zoning Ordinance. Any Section of the Subdivision Regulations not specifically addressed or pre-empted by this Section shall apply. Any question of conflict will be interpreted by the Planning Board. Definitions contained in Article XV of the Pelham Zoning Ordinance shall apply to this Section of the Subdivision Regulations.
205-2 Application Procedure
All applications submitted to the Planning Board under this Section shall include the following information to confirm compliance with the intent of this Section and Article XV of the Zoning Ordinance. Applicants are encouraged to meet with the Planning Board for conceptual review prior to submitting a yield plan application to discuss the Board’s expectations of what should be included in the plan and how it will be reviewed.
Upon review of the information set forth below the Planning Board may grant preliminary approval for the maximum number of building lots which may be developed if the applicant can show the site meets the requirements of these Regulations and the Zoning Ordinance including any proposed density offset.
A. Natural Features Data:
1. A natural resources inventory which shall, at a minimum, describe any important features, wildlife habitat or other environmentally sensitive areas which may be disturbed by the proposed development or that may abut the site. The most recent version of the Natural Service Network (NSN) user guide and associated map
48
available through the Planning Department or its website (www.pelhamweb.com/planning) should be consulted to confirm inventory findings for the subject parcel and adjacent parcels.
2. Special consideration shall be given to the location of large contiguous forest stands, wildlife corridors, environmentally sensitive areas, historic sites, trails, active farms or farmlands which are located on the site or on properties which abut the site.
B. Preliminary Conservation Subdivision Development Data:
1. A plan of the site, which shows the areas proposed for development, common areas (and their uses), and areas that are proposed as protected open space.
2. The plan shall also show any areas which are considered as view-sheds, active farming, recreation (proposed or current), environmentally sensitive areas and any trails or corridors which are to be protected.
3. A proposed layout of homes sites, roadways on the property, limitations on land clearing and buffer zones along with a discussion of how the proposed layout will provide for the greatest protection of the open space lands, an environmentally sensitive development and a quality neighborhood.
4. A request for any density offset which the applicant may seek.
5. Request for waivers.
C. A yield plan as defined in Section 205-3.
D. Final Application
Upon review of this information and approval of a yield plan the applicant shall be authorized to proceed with a complete, fully-engineered Conservation Subdivision Plan in accordance with the Planning Board’s yield plan approval.
Section 205-3 Yield Plan
In accordance with the Conservation Subdivision Ordinance, the applicable density shall be determined through submittal of a yield plan. The yield plan shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Board in accordance with the following:
49
A. The yield plan shall incorporate soils information sufficient to determine estimated lot sizes by soil type.
B. The yield plan shall incorporate roads and rights-of-way that provided for a layout that corresponds with existing State and Federal laws, town ordinances, and Subdivision Regulations, including but not limited to minimization of wetland crossings, road length requirements, right-of-way widths, and safe sight distance for entrances.
C. The yield plan is meant to be conceptual in nature but must be realistic and not show potential house sites or streets in areas that would not normally be legally permitted, or environmentally or economically viable in a conventional layout.
D. In addition to the above, the yield plan shall include: basis topography, wetlands, floodplains, frontage dimensions, building setbacks, steep slopes (greater than 20%), soils subject to slumping, contiguous non-wet areas and other areas of land where it is not feasible to accommodate building sites and individual septic systems. Additionally, for each building lot the plan must show the required thirty-five thousand (35,000) square feet of contiguous upland soils, the fifteen thousand (15,000) square foot (100’ x 150’) building envelope, four thousand (4,000) square foot septic area, well radii, centerline of road and road profile, as defined elsewhere in these Subdivision Regulations.
E. The yield plan shall specify that waivers are requested in order to make the yield plan valid. The Board shall review the reasonableness of the assumptions underpinning the waivers that support the yield plan.
F. The Planning Board may require design review of the yield plan from the engineering review firm of their choice to confirm or refute the proposed density shown on the yield plan at the applicant’s expense.
205-4 Density Offset Criteria
These Regulations provide for the available open space offset as authorized under Article XV of the Zoning Ordinance. To be considered by the Planning Board for a Special Use Permit the proposed Conservation Subdivision plan shall provide that a minimum of forty percent (40%) of the total parcel shall be set aside as open space and protected as such in perpetuity. In no instance shall the Planning Board grant density offsets totaling in excess of twenty percent (20%) beyond the density established by the yield plan.
The required open space may be used, with conditions as may be required by the Planning Board, for the protection of forest or other natural or environmental areas as set forth in Section 205-5. For appropriate parcels, forested land shall be managed consistent with a forest management plan
50
prepared by a Licensed Forester and incorporating best management practices. The forestry management plan shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Board or its designee.
If the land proposed as open space is found to be significant to the protection of the natural environment the placement of any improvements that would adversely affect or destroy wildlife corridors, natural dense forested stands or active farm lands may be restricted by the Planning Board.
The purposes for which open space areas are proposed shall be fully documented by the applicant.
Density offsets can be earned by including within the Conservation Subdivision plan one or more of the elements described in Sub-Sections A through E of their sub-elements as defined below to the Planning Board’s satisfaction:
A. Unique Land and Environmental Features and/or Facilities:
In granting density offsets, the Planning Board may consider the following:
1. View-sheds: Lands or corridors of land that contribute to the visual landscape of the Town, including items such as, but not limited to, open fields, stonewalls, hills, mature stands of trees, visible water bodies and their natural buffers.
2. Historically Significant Buildings and Landscapes: Identified as such in the Master Plan, which includes buildings and associated uses that are maintained and visually separated from the developed portion of the Conservation Subdivision. Structures or landscapes not identified as such through the Master Plan may be determined by sufficient evidence presented to the Planning Board during review of the application. Such evidence may include listing or eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic Landmarks, or other qualified statements of historic value.
3. Valuable Wildlife and Environmental Areas: Otherwise buildable land, proven as such through an environmental resource inventory by a qualified wildlife biologist specializing in either flora or fauna. The most current version of the Natural Service Network (NSN) user guide and associated map available through the Planning Department or its website (www.pelhamweb.com/planning) should be consulted to confirm inventory findings. Reports by a Certified Wetland Scientist or Certified Soil Scientist shall not satisfy these criteria.
4. Linking Open Space Parcels or Trail Corridors: Through the site with existing trails or open space networks. The beginning of such a network or trail may be considered as linking where reasonable opportunity is present for establishing
51
through corridors into neighboring parcels and provide that the Conservation Commission comment is in favor of this location.
5. Innovative Stormwater and Wastewater Treatment Facilities: Which provide for the reintegration of stormwater into the groundwater system or provide for the innovative treatment of wastewater within the development (i.e. Low Impact Development systems such as porous pavement and/or bio-retention systems) or through sharing of an innovative treatment system with other nearby developments through the development of a community wastewater treatment system as may be approved by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services.
6. Agricultural Lands and Use Offset: Where the development protects agriculturally valuable lands and provides permission for their use as such in perpetuity, the development may be awarded a density offset. The Planning Board shall, on a case by case basis, determine the offset percentage by considering the size of the project and the number of acres of farmland preserved. The open space portion preserved for agricultural use must be land that has been historically farmed or contain good soils for farming and must be reasonably accessible to receive an offset. A minimum of three and one-half (3.5) contiguous acres must be available for agricultural uses in order to receive any offset under this Section. The instrument granting use, acceptable to the Planning Board, may reasonably restrict the type or intensity of farming to occur to prevent nuisances. This provision only requires that permission is reasonably available, the fact that agricultural uses are not pursued at any particular time does not affect the validity of the offset.
7. Additional Open Space: Increase the amount of protected open space to a minimum of fifty percent (50%).
B. Innovative layout and design of the project to encourage a village or community type environment with such amenities as village greens and parks, community view-sheds and/or integration into existing protected farm activities or existing passive recreational opportunities, the Pelham Planning Board may grant the development a density offset based on the following:
1. The location and integration of the development into an existing active farm or recreational activity, where residents are able to participate in the recreational activity or where a majority of the units abut active farm lands.
2. The development of a central village green with single-loaded streets and service ways which allow units to front on villages greens, park areas or view-sheds.
52
3. Layout of the development where all units may enjoy direct community access to view-sheds or parklands.
4. Innovative layout, which provides for the integration of the development into the natural features and forested areas of the parcel, which would provide for the protection and enjoyment of the natural environment yet provide for pedestrian travel within the site.
5. Development of scenic or terminal vistas which will maximize the visual impact of any protected areas so that residents and visitors will correctly perceive the conservation emphasis of the development.
C. Recreation & Public Access Offset: For the development of new recreational facilities such as parks, playgrounds, trails and/or community centers, the Board may grant a density offset. If the improvements are made available to the general public, this offset may be increased. In granting the offset the Board may consider the following:
1. Self-directed trails and facilities, green space parks and family picnic areas.
2. Open fields prepared for the use of active sports and group activities.
3. Constructed playgrounds and play areas.
4. Community center or meeting facilities.
D. Frontage Lots: A density offset may be granted for the protection of each potential frontage lot as open space. In granting this offset the Board may consider the following:
1. The ability to provide a visual buffer to the development area.
2. The protection of scenic overlooks and natural viewing points.
3. The historical or environmental value of the provided lots.
4. Active usage for agricultural purposes and/or the protection of historic farming activities.
5. The lot is buildable and the required legal frontage on a roadway existing at the time of application.
53
6. The lot be protected in a natural condition.
E. Workforce Housing: Workforce Housing density offsets can be achieved by compliance with the following criteria:
1. Density Offset (Affordable Housing Sales): Density offsets of up to twenty percent (20%) above that indicated by the yield plan will be allowed for developments that will guarantee:
a. Twenty percent (20%) of the total number of units proposed within the development (including all units allowed by density offsets) shall be affordable as defined below.
b.

c. Five percent (5%) or more of the units constructed will be sold at an initial sale for a price which is affordable to a household with an income of not more than eighty percent (80%) of the median family income for a four person household for the New Hampshire portion of the Nashua, New Hampshire Metropolitan Fair Market Rent Area, as published by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
d. Units will be sold with deed restrictions and a recorded housing agreement that limits, for a period of thirty (30) years renewable upon sale or transfer, the resale value of the unit to not more than the purchase price plus two times the accumulated consumer price index.
e. The unit shall be on-site.
2. Density Offsets (Affordable Housing Rentals): A density offset of up to twenty percent (20%) above that indicated by the yield plan will be allowed for developments that will guarantee:

e. The foregoing density offsets are not cumulative and no project shall receive more than a twenty percent (20%) overall density bonus for affordability.
205-5 Open Space Criteria
Open space shall be available for recreational use by the residents of the Conservation Subdivision. General public use may be considered but shall not be required. The criteria are necessitated by
56
the unique features of each proposed subdivision. Where land is to be developed in a manner that will result in a significant number of people forming a community on that land, adequate recreational space is a necessity. These criteria are intended to provide that those moving into the subdivision will have adequate recreational area.
A. A minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the total required open space land must be useable uplands and available for recreational purposes, provided however, that not more than fifty percent (50%) shall be utilized for such purpose in order to preserve a proportion of natural area on the site.
B. Recreational uses may include, but are not limited to trails, recreational/athletic fields for sports, cross country ski trails, tennis facilities, swimming pools, playgrounds for children, off-road bicycle paths, horse-back riding, etc.
1. Uses customarily accessory to permitted outdoor recreational uses such as small clubhouses (less than 1,500 square foot footprint), maintenance facilities, or gazebos shall be permitted.
2. Where recreational uses may interfere with neighboring residentially zoned or used parcels, the Planning Board shall require measures to mitigate any possible negative effects. Such measures may include sufficiently opaque visual barriers, placement within the interior of the development, and limitations on night lighting and use.
3. Recreational facilities shall be constructed by the developer or financial provision for construction shall be provided by the developer to the homeowners association in order to adequately insure their proper function.
4. Land targeted for recreational use shall not occupy the exterior buffer of the development site unless such use is limited to trails.
C. The minimum required open space shall not contain more than fifty percent (50%) of the sum of the following kinds of non-buildable land:
1. Poorly drained or very poorly drained soils as defined in the most recently published edition of Site Specific Soil Mapping Standards for New Hampshire and Vermont;
2. Slopes having a natural slope in excess of twenty-percent (20%) or soils subject to slumping;
3. Drainage facilities, except constructed ponds intended to be filled with water year-around that are part of a drainage plan, may be included in the open space calculation;
4. Land used for subsurface sewage disposal systems; and
57
5. Land within the 100-year flood hazard area as shown on current Flood Insurance Rate Maps published by FEMA.
No portion of public utility easements, with above ground improvements of any kind, may be considered part of the minimum required open space. Expansion or creation of a public utility easement after approval of a development shall not affect the requirements for provision of open space or recreational uses of the development.
D. Open Space Layout: Open space land shall be designated as undivided parcels to facilitate easement monitoring, enforcement, maintenance, and to promote appropriate management by a single entity according to approved land management standards.
1. As part of the application an open space plan shall be submitted showing clear delineation of parcels of open space land that is not to be developed. The open space plan shall be recorded at the Registry of Deeds and shall indicate that development is restricted from the open space in perpetuity.
2. Open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practical number of lots within the development.
3. Safe and convenient pedestrian access to open space shall be provided from all lots not adjoining the open space.
E. Wells, well radii and associated water supply infrastructure, including pump houses shall be allowed within the open space.
205-6 Roadway Design Criteria
Public roadways shall be built in accordance with conventional Subdivision Regulations. Private roadways within Conservation Subdivision developments may adhere to the following Conservation Subdivision roadway design specifications:
A. Entrance Roadways: Roadways that provide access to the development at any intersection with public roads, and continue through to the first internal intersection with one or more private internal street(s). Entrance roadways shall generally be constructed to public roadway standards.
B. Arterial Branch Roadways: Roadways that serve twenty-five (25) dwellings or less which branch off from an entrance roadway. Arterial branch roadways shall be constructed to public roadway standards; however, the Planning Board may permit a width reduction to
58
not less than twenty (20) feet provided that health and safety issues are not jeopardized by the reduced road width.
C. Common Driveways: Roadways that serve not more than six (6) dwellings which branch off from an Arterial Branch Roadway or Entrance Roadway. Common Driveways that serve more than two (2) dwellings shall be constructed to public roadway standards; however, the Planning Board may permit the width to be reduced to eighteen (18) feet provided that health and safety issues are not jeopardized by the reduced road width.
D. Dead End Roadways: All roadway endings shall be constructed with innovative design methods in mind. The intent of this requirement is to promote the construction of aesthetically pleasing neighborhood environments with the Conservation Subdivision development provided however, that health and safety issues are not jeopardized by reduced road width. These methods shall include landscaped center loops for dead-end roads of one of the following designs:
1. Circular Loop Drive: May be eighteen (18) feet in width and with a minimum radius of seventy-five (75) feet from center to the inside edge of pavement with travel permitted in a single direction. The center portion of the roadway radius shall contain remaining mature trees, or shall be landscaped with shrubs, rock, or other landscape features and shall not consist solely of grassed surfaces. These areas shall not be counted as part of the open space calculation. Units accessed by circular loop drives shall have parking facilities to accommodate three (3) vehicles of off-street parking (this count may be met by garage space and driveway area with one parking space provided in an off-street parking area).
2. Elliptical Loop Drive: These roadways shall serve not more than eight (8) dwellings and must be a minimum of eighteen (18) feet in width. The minimum dimensions of the central green for this type of roadway shall be one hundred (100) feet wide and one hundred and fifty (150) feet long, on average, and may contain open grassed areas in addition to required landscaped areas, remaining mature trees, and any pedestrian facilities such as benches, gazebos, and playground facilities for children. If an applicant elects to utilize this innovative design method, the open central area shall be considered part of the open space calculation. Dwellings serviced by Elliptical Loop Drives shall have parking facilities to accommodate three (3) vehicles (in total) of off-street parking (this count may be met by garage space and driveway area and one space in an off-street parking area that must be within a reasonable distance of the units served).
59
205-7 Road Specifications
Roadway specifications shall apply as described in Section 203-4 of these Subdivision Regulations. However, the Planning Board may grant waivers from specific requirements of Section 203-4 on a case by case basis after thorough review including receipt of input from the Highway Safety Committee.
The Planning Board should encourage flexible and innovative road design standards for Conservation Subdivisions that maintain rural character through reduction in width standards, provided health and safety concerns are met, and encourage the development of neighborhood environments that will enhance quality of life and property values through the inclusion of village green concepts.
The Planning Board may require that Conservation Subdivision entrance roadways be built in accordance with public roadways standards contained in Section 203-4 of these Regulations. Where future road connection is reasonably possible and anticipated by the Planning Board, the entrance roadway leading to the point of future connection may be considered an entrance roadway and not included in any association form of ownership as a private way.
205-8 Additional Requirements
As part of any application for approval of a Conservation Subdivision, whether roadway design waivers are granted or not, the Planning Board may require additional facilities to ensure adequate access and service for safety vehicles, including but not limited to additional off-street parking, turn-outs or turnarounds, fire hydrants, cisterns or other recommended accommodations.
205-9 Legal Review & Approval
A legal review of the proposed Conservation Subdivision shall be conducted under the conditions identified herein:
A. Any condominium agreements, deed restrictions, organizational provisions for a mandatory homeowner’s association, or other legal entities providing for ownership or individual dwelling units and a sharing of certain utilities, open space, common areas, and auxiliary facilities and structures must be approved in writing by the Planning Board and by Town Counsel and any other municipal, county, or state agency, body, commission or department required by law to assure the same.
B. The developer shall submit a suitable legal instrument which, to the satisfaction of the Planning Board and/or Town Counsel, will assure that such open space and/or common
60
land will continue to be used for conservation, park or recreation and shall not be disposed of by sale or otherwise except to any organization established for the purpose of owning and maintaining such open space. Land held in open space may thereafter not be used to satisfy density requirements for any other project than the yield plan approved for the project.
C. Such developer shall also provide for adequate maintenance of such areas set aside for conservation, park, or recreation. Such developer shall provide for the insertion in all deeds, in a form approved by the Planning Board and/or the Town Counsel any and all safeguards and conditions suitable to carry out the purposes of these Regulations.
D. Such legal instruments shall also provide that the Town of Pelham, its agents, servants and employees may, without liability, enter upon such land held for conservation, park or recreation to inspect for compliance.
205-10 Expiration
As described in Article XV, Section 307-107 of the Zoning Ordinance any Special Permit granted by the Planning Board shall expire if there has not been active and substantial development or construction on the site by the owner or owner’s successor in interest in accordance with the approved plan within twelve (12) months after the date of approval. As part of the approval of a plan, the Planning Board may, with due regard to the scope and details of a particular project, specify the threshold level of work which shall constitute “active and substantial development or consideration” for purposes of complying with this paragraph.

Section 302 - APPLICATION PROCEDURES & REQUIREMENTS
302-1 General Provisions and Requirements
A. Residents and business owners, who may from time to time seek to change or amend the use of, or minimally alter or expand existing non-residential or multi-family buildings or sites, may apply for site plan determination. The Planning Board may, after submittal of an executed application for site plan determination, conduct a duly noticed public hearing and grant approval to such applications without benefit of formal site plan review. In order for any proposal to be eligible for approval through site plan determination, the site or building to be modified or expanded must have previously received site plan approval from the Planning Board. Proposals eligible for approval through site plan determination shall be limited to those involving one or more of the following activities: (1) change of use of an existing building or site from one permitted use to another permitted use; (2) additions to and/or renovations of existing structures such that the gross floor area of any existing structure does not increase by more than 10-percent or 1,000 square feet, whichever is less; (3) site improvements or modifications which alter not more than 10,000 square feet of lot area; and (4) other minor site plan proposals which the Planning Board may elect to consider. All non-residential development or multi-family residential land use proposals which do not have benefit of prior site plan approval or which contemplate a scope of work or activity which exceeds the limitations specified above must obtain site plan approval from the Planning Board prior to issuance of a building permit and/or commencement of construction as applicable.
B. Prior to submission of an application for either site plan determination or site plan review by the Planning Board, applicants and/or their representatives are encouraged to meet with the Planning Director in order to discuss their proposals and gain the Planner’s advice in regard to conformance with applicable requirements of the Town of Pelham’s land use ordinances and regulations.
C. Any application for review and consideration by the Planning Board shall be filed with Planning Department not less than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the date of the regular meeting of the Planning Board at which the applicant seeks such consideration. After an application has been submitted to the Planning Department, the applicant may not supplement, revise or modify the application after notice of public hearing has been given without consent of the Planning Director. The applicant may provide additional information upon affirmative vote of the Planning Board at a noticed public hearing. An applicant may withdraw an application prior to public hearing; however, in the case of withdrawal, any and all application fees paid by the applicant prior to the date of withdrawal shall be forfeited and the applicant shall remain liable for any expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Planning Board in the processing or technical review of the application prior to application withdrawal.
66
D. By filing any application under these Regulations, the owner and applicant acknowledge and consent to: (1) unobstructed entry to and viewing of the land that is the subject of the application by public officials, including members of the Planning Board, their staff, consultants or others so authorized by the Board; and (2) third party review of plans and application materials, pursuant to RSA 676:4-b, which have been submitted to the Board as part of the application.
302-2 Classification of Applications
Under the provisions of these Site Plan Regulations and applicable statute, the Pelham Planning Board shall receive and act upon site plan review applications for:
• Non-residential & Multi-family development; and
• Site plan determination.
In recognition of the varying degree of complexity typically associated with each type of application, these Regulations provide for separate and distinct procedures for applicants and the Planning Board to follow in the submission, review and consideration of each type of application.
302-3 Non-Residential and Multi-Family Development
A. Applicants for new non-residential or multi-family residential uses shall file an application for site plan review in accordance with all applicable provisions of these Regulations.
B. If a site plan review application is determined to be complete by the Planning Board, it shall be accepted for formal consideration pursuant to RSA 676:4, I(c) and the Board shall act to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove that application. Although it is the intent of these Regulations to facilitate timely review and approval of applications which comply with applicable requirements of the Pelham Zoning Ordinance and these Regulations, applicants are encouraged to engage in preliminary conceptual consultation or design review with the Planning Board prior to the submittal of an application for final site plan approval. In the event any applicant wishes to pursue preliminary conceptual consultation or design review with the Planning Board, the Planning Board shall provide that opportunity consistent with the procedures and limitations described herein.
C. Preliminary Conceptual Consultation
In order to afford applicants proper guidance as well as an opportunity to potentially save time and expense when advancing an application for final site plan approval, an applicant may request an opportunity to engage in preliminary conceptual consultation with the Planning Board prior to submitting an application for formal review and consideration by the Board. Those wishing to engage in preliminary conceptual consultation with the Planning Board may make such a request to the Planning Director. Upon receipt of such a request, the Planning Director shall place an applicant on the agenda of an upcoming public meeting of the Planning Board. All discussion occurring during preliminary conceptual consultation shall be directed at and limited to a review of basic concepts of the proposal
67
and suggestions which might be of assistance in resolving problems with meeting requirements during final consideration. Such consultation shall not bind either the applicant or the Board and statements made by Planning Board members shall not be the basis for disqualifying said members or invalidating any action taken. The Board and the applicant may discuss proposals in conceptual form only and in general terms such as the desirability of types of development and proposals under the Master Plan. Preliminary conceptual consultation may occur without the necessity of giving formal public notice pursuant to RSA 676:4, I(d), however, such consultation may occur only at a public meeting of the Board.
D. Design Review Phase
The Planning Board may engage in nonbinding discussions with the applicant, beyond conceptual and general discussions, which involve more specific design and engineering details provided, however, that design review phase may proceed only after notice to abutters, holders of conservation, preservation, or agricultural preservation restrictions, and the general public pursuant to RSA 676:4, I(d). If an applicant desires to proceed with design review, arrangements for this phase may be made by filing an executed application form, together with five (5) copies of plans conforming to the requirements of these Regulations, and payment of applicable fees with the Planning Department not less than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to a regular meeting of the Board. After undertaking design review at a public meeting, the Planning Board may determine the design review phase of an application has ended and shall inform the applicant in writing within ten (10) calendar days of such determination. Statements made by Planning Board members during the design review phase shall not be the basis for disqualifying said members or invalidating any action taken.

302-5 Issuance of Notice of Decision, Plat Certification and Recording
A. The Planning Board shall issue a final written Notice of Decision which either approves, conditionally approves pursuant to RSA 676:4, I(i), or disapproves any application for site plan review or site plan determination. If an application is not approved, the Board shall provide the applicant with written reasons for such disapproval. Whenever the Planning Board votes to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove an application, the minutes of the meeting at which such vote is taken, including the written decision containing the reasons therefore, shall be placed on file in the Board’s office and shall be made available for public inspection within five (5) business days of such vote pursuant to the requirements of RSA 676:3, II.

72
Once such a determination has been made, said plans shall be signed by the Planning Board Chair and Secretary or their designees.
E. Neither the approval of a site plan application nor the subsequent recording of any approved plat or plan shall be deemed to constitute or affect public acceptance, or an obligation for future public acceptance, of any dedicated street, utility, land or easement, which may be shown on said plat or plan, by the Town of Pelham.
302-6 Application Fees and Costs
A. Upon receipt of an application, the Planning Department shall determine the amount of those application fees, payable at the time of application delivery, and shall not place an application on the Board’s agenda for consideration unless and until the full amount of such fees have been paid in full.

C. Pursuant to RSA 676:4-b the Planning Board shall require an applicant to reimburse the Board for expenses reasonably incurred by obtaining third party review and consultation during the application review process.
D. It is the normal practice of the Planning Board not to record approved site plans at the Hillsborough County Registry of Deeds. However, if the applicant or owner desires to record an approved site plan at the Registry of Deeds, at the time final plans and mylars are transmitted to the Planning Department for signature and recording, the applicant shall also submit a check, in the amount of $25.00, payable to the “Hillsborough County Registry of Deeds”. The Planning Director shall in turn forward this check to the Registry of Deeds at the time of plat recordation in order to satisfy the New Hampshire Land Conservation Investment Program (LCHIP) surcharge fee, payable under New Hampshire law.
E. No approved plat or plan shall be signed by the Planning Board Chair and Secretary, or their designees, nor be recorded at the Hillsborough County Registry of Deeds, unless and until all fees payable to the Planning Board by the applicant have been received by the Planning Department.

B. Parking Density Requirements
1) All non-residential and multi-family residential sites shall provide on-site parking at a rate greater than or equal to that specified below. Where the computation of required parking density results in a fractional number of spaces, the required number of spaces shall be rounded upwards to the nearest whole number (i.e. a computed density of 39.2 or 39.8 spaces results in a requirement for 40 spaces). In cases where a single site has or is to have multiple uses, parking requirements for each use shall be calculated in accordance with the requirements of this Section and the total number of required on-site parking spaces shall be equal to the sum of the combined minimum parking density requirements for each constituent use. At the request of an applicant, the Planning Board, at its discretion, may authorize initial construction of fewer parking spaces than otherwise be required under these Regulations provided: (a) the approved site plan identifies a suitable location and design of the full measure of parking spaces required under these Regulations; (b) the approved site plan identifies such areas as “reserved for future parking expansion”; and (c) a note is placed on the final site plan documenting any temporary relaxation in on-site parking requirements permitted by the Planning Board and acknowledging that the applicant, its heirs, successors or assigns agrees to construct additional parking spaces within those areas identified as “reserved for future parking expansion” within six months of receipt of written notice from the Planning Board to do so and further acknowledging that failure to comply with such written notice may result in a full or partial revocation of the certificate of occupancy for the facility served by said parking facility.
2) Handicapped accessible spaces, in sufficient number and dimension to satisfy applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), shall be provided at all non-residential and multi-family residential sites.
76

Section 304 – ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN STANDARDS
304-1 Purpose
The purpose of these Architectural Design Standards is to provide for harmonious and aesthetically pleasing non-residential and multi-family residential with the municipality and its environs and to promote a stable property tax base in those zoning districts, within which mixed use development is permitted, through the use of construction materials of similar context and value. These standards are intended to encourage preservation and re-use of historic structures while facilitating the construction of new buildings and structures, including corporate franchise prototypes, in a manner which captures and embraces architectural elements commonly associated with New England’s Regional identity to the extent practicable. These standards are not intended to discourage creativity and innovation. Rather, the intent of this Section is to encourage cooperation between public and private interests to the extent necessary in order to ensure a mutually acceptable outcome.
304-2 Applicability
The requirements of this Section shall be applicable to all applications for approval of non-residential and multi-family residential site plans under these Regulations. In addition, in those instances where an owner of an existing non-residential or multi-family residential structure or building desires to make exterior architectural changes, and where a requirement for site plan approval does not otherwise exist under Section 302-1 of these Regulations, such property owner shall file an application with the Planning Board for architectural review under this Section. Proposals involving routine maintenance, repair, in-kind replacement of one or more architectural features that do not involve a change in design, dimensions, or materials are exempt from the requirements of this Section and are not subject to architectural review by the Planning Board.
304-3 Design Standards Applicable to Districts other than the Mixed Use Zoning District
The following Design Standards shall apply for all proposed non-residential and multi-family residential proposals in districts other than the Mixed Use Zoning District (MUZD).
A. In order to protect the aesthetic character of the community and to improve the quality of new development, the design of building façades may be regulated at the discretion of the Planning Board.
B. Architectural design of all proposed buildings and structures, in the opinion of the Planning Board, must be consistent with or improve upon the architectural character of the neighborhood within which the subject site is situate.
C. The roof form of proposed buildings and structures must be compatible with that of
86
adjacent structures where appropriate, by duplicating the shape, pitch, and materials:
1) A pitched roof should generally be provided on new structures having a building footprint of 12,000 square feet or less.
2) In the case of sites having multiple buildings, structures or elements, the roof form of the primary structure should be duplicated throughout whenever practical (see Figure 1).
3) For structures with a footprint larger than 12,000 square feet, flat roofs may be permitted, provided that a mansard roof style is employed (see Figure 2).
4) Varied offsets, roof heights, forms and window placement should be incorporated into all new structures or additions to existing structures (see Figure 3).
5) Refer to sample graphics below for examples regarding common roof form and mansard roofs.

304-4 Design Standards Applicable to the Mixed Use Zoning District
In addition to those standards contained in Section 304-3, the following additional criteria shall be required for all site plan applications proposed within the Mixed Use Zoning Overlay District.
.
A. General Guidelines:
1) Recognizing that every property, proposal and situation are unique; the Planning Board may waive or modify any of the standards specified herein as it reasonably deems appropriate, based upon the individual circumstances. No particular style is stipulated and innovative, contemporary, and distinctive designs may be permitted, provided they are respectful of general design principles and context.
2) It is recognized that many national and regional chain businesses seek to build a standard design across the country or region without regard to local conditions. The Planning Board will evaluate proposed designs for compatibility with the District and for conformance with the purpose of these regulations.
3) In general, buildings shall be compatible with traditional New England architecture and should be articulated to express an architectural identity.
4) In general, buildings shall possess an overall integrity. Architectural details should not give the impression of being tacked on but rather integral to overall design. As an example, use of undersized shutters on a picture window or installation of an elaborate classical portico or cupola on an otherwise clearly utilitarian structure should be discouraged.
5) Reuse of existing structures that have special architectural, historical, cultural, or contextual value is strongly encouraged.
6) Modifications and additions to existing buildings should be harmonious with the prevailing character of the existing building when the existing building is in general conformance with the goals of these regulations.
B. Design Elements:
The purpose of these standards is to encourage architecture that draws its inspiration from traditional New England style. Building design should reinforce a human-scaled environment through careful consideration of architectural forms, massing, detailing, number and use of materials, and color. The Planning Board strongly encourages consideration of the following design elements:
1) Roofs: Monotony of design or warehouse style structures shall be avoided. Variation in detail, form and siting shall be used to provide visual interest. In order to prevent the construction of warehouse style buildings (i.e. long horizontal roof lines), all new buildings and additions should have pitched or gabled roofs where
89
practical. Shed, gambrel and barn style roofs are also acceptable. Roofs should have appropriate overhangs and soffits. The use of dormers is encouraged.
All rooftop mechanical/ventilation equipment must be placed in such a manner so that it is not visible from public ways and adjacent properties. This goal may be accomplished by using architectural treatment/camouflaging (walls, parapets, false chimneys, etc.) or by other appropriate means.
2) Building materials: Exterior surfaces of buildings should be covered with traditional materials or products which simulate natural materials, including but not limited to clapboards, shingles, stone or brick. Exposed masonry block, corrugated steel and synthetic panels are not acceptable. Pitched roofs should be constructed of shingles, standing seam metal or other materials traditionally used in this Region.
3) Awnings: Brightly colored or illuminated franchise type awnings are not acceptable. Awnings may be made of transparent materials (glass or clear Plexiglas type products). Awning covers designed for shade should be made of fabric or simulated fabric-like material.
4) Architectural Details: Balconies, decks, covered porches, decorative shingles, bracketed eaves, columns, balustrades, towers, turrets, skylights, and arches are among the details to be considered and encouraged. All features and details should be in proportion to the building.
5) Windows: Windows should be incorporated on front and side facades to humanize the building. It is preferable that windows be vertical with the vertical dimension exceeding the horizontal. The use of large picture-type windows for first-floor retail uses is strongly encouraged. Windows may be used for either interior illumination or for display purposes.
6) Entrances: Articulation of building entrances is encouraged through the use of a portico, canopy, awning, sidelights, surround, or similar architectural feature.
7) Fencing: Fencing made of traditional New England materials is encouraged (i.e. picket, split rail, wrought iron, brick or stone). Chain link security fences may be allowed where appropriate, but use of this material is generally discouraged.
8) Color: Subtle, neutral colors should be used on larger, plain buildings. Paint colors should relate to the natural colors of building materials, such as brick, stucco, etc. Complimentary colors on architectural details are encouraged, as are historic colors. Bright, franchise colors are discouraged.
90
Section 305 - PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE REQUIREMENTS & CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES
305-1 General Requirements
H. Pursuant to RSA 674:44, III (d) the Planning Board may stipulate, as a precedent condition of approval, that a performance guarantee, in an amount and form acceptable to the Board, be received and filed with the Town prior to signature of a final plat by the Board Chair and Secretary. Specific requirements and procedures governing such performance guarantees are provided elsewhere in these Regulations.
I. No land clearing for the facilitation of construction of site improvements contemplated on, or in anticipation of, a site plan submitted to the Planning Board for review and approval under these Regulations shall occur until such time as a site plan has been approved and signed. Further, no building or site construction shall commence, nor shall a building permit be issued for such construction, unless and until a site plan has received final approval from the Planning Board and been signed in acknowledgement of the same.
J. In the case of site plans involving the construction or installation of betterments on existing public lands or within an existing public right-of-way, the contractor or entity who will be performing such work shall provide the Town of Pelham with a copy of a certificate demonstrating said contractor possesses insurance coverage conforming to the following minimum limits: (1) General Liability - $1,000,000; (2) Automotive Liability - $1,000,000; and (3) Workers Compensation and Employers Liability – Statutory Limits.
K. In the case of site plans involving the platting of public streets and/or public easements of any kind, the applicant shall submit, at the time final plans and mylars of such site plan are transmitted to the Planning Department for signature, executed deeds for the conveyance of platted street rights-of-way and/or public easements to the Town of Pelham. Such deeds shall be in a form acceptable to Town Counsel and be suitable for recording at the registry of deeds.
L. No Building Permit shall be issued for the construction of a structure or site intended to be accessed by a platted or improved street until such time as construction of that street has progressed to a point where the Planning Director, in consultation with Pelham Police and Fire Department personnel has determined the condition of such street is sufficient to safely accommodate construction traffic and emergency services personnel.
M. No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued for any structure or site unless and until all work shown on an approved site plan is fully complete and determined to be satisfactory by the Planning Director. However, in certain instances and for good cause and reason, the Planning Director may authorize issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy provided the owner provides a performance guarantee, in an amount and form acceptable to the Town, to serve as a financial guarantee for timely and successful completion of site improvements which remain to be completed, corrected or begun.
91
N. Upon issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for any structure or site permitted under these Regulations, the property owner, his/her heirs, successors or assigns shall provide for timely and proper maintenance of the property to the extent needed in order to protect, preserve and maintain the functionality and appearance of those improvements approved by the Planning Board. In the event a landowner fails to fulfill this requirement, the Town of Pelham may compel said landowner to properly restore and maintain the premises in a manner consistent with the provisions of an approved site plan and these Regulations through any and all remedies available under New Hampshire law.
305-2 Performance Guarantee Requirements and Procedures
G. The Planning Board may stipulate, as a condition precedent to final site plan approval, that a performance guarantee be provided to serve as financial surety for full and successful completion of the work, a portion thereof, or adequate restoration of the site should the applicant fail to complete the project in a timely manner. In such instances, the Town Engineer shall provide the Planning Director with a recommendation as to surety value.
H. The Planning Board shall receive a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, cash, or other form of surety acceptable to the Board. In all instances, the form or instrument of surety provided shall be acceptable to Town Counsel. In all instances, the form of the surety instrument shall specify the term and duration of the surety, include an “automatic call” provision, and acknowledge that the surety shall neither lapse nor terminate until released in writing by the Board of Selectmen.
I. In the event improvements for which a performance guarantee has been given remain incomplete or are found to have been completed in an unacceptable manner, the Town of Pelham shall enjoy the right to call the performance guarantee and utilize the proceeds of the same to cause any required improvements to be properly completed or repaired.
J. As site improvements for which a performance guarantee has been given are completed, the Planning Board may, upon request of the applicant and receipt of a favorable recommendation from the Town Engineer, recommend the Board of Selectmen vote to release all or a portion of the remaining surety. However, in no case shall the value of any performance guarantee, which may continue to be held by the Town of Pelham, represent a sum less than 110-percent of the anticipated cost of completion or correction of all remaining work as estimated by the Town Engineer. Only upon full and final completion of all work contemplated under an approved site plan, as determined by the Town Engineer, may a performance guarantee be released in full.
92
305-3 Inspection Requirements and Procedures
E. Prior to commencement of construction, the applicant or his/her representative shall contact the Planning Director and request that a preconstruction conference be scheduled. Upon receipt of such a request, the Planning Director shall promptly schedule a preconstruction conference, which shall be attended by the Planning Director, the Town Engineer, the owner or owner’s representative, the contractor and other parties invited by the owner, Planning Director or Town Engineer. At the time of the pre-construction conference, the Town Engineer shall review applicable Town construction requirements and procedures with attendees and confirm that all items prerequisite to the commencement of construction have been satisfied.
F. During the construction period, the Town Engineer shall serve as the Planning Board’s field representative observing and reporting to the Planning Director on the progression of the work. During this period, the Town Engineer shall promptly report to the Planning Director and the owner any perceived construction defect or deviation from the terms of the approval of approved project plans. In such instances, the Town Engineer may also offer recommendations for the remedy of such defects or deviations.
G. The Town Engineer shall periodically invoice the Planning Department for services during the course of construction; and the Planning Department shall in turn require the owner to reimburse the Board for such costs. In the event the owner fails to reimburse in a timely manner for the cost associated with the Town Engineer’s services, the Planning Director may issue a stop work order which shall not be withdrawn until the Planning Department has been reimbursed in full for the Town Engineer’s services. In the event an owner fails to reimburse the Planning Department for the Town Engineer’s services, the Town of Pelham may call upon any performance guarantee given by the owner to satisfy such costs.
H. If during the construction, changes in the design of those improvements specified on an approved site plan are proposed, the owner shall notify the Town Engineer in advance of proceeding with the same. Upon receipt of a request for a design change, the Planning Director, in concert with the Town Engineer shall make a determination as to whether or not the request represents a significant change in the approved plans and specifications. If the Planning Director makes the determination that a requested change is significant, the owner shall not proceed to make such change without the approval of the Planning Board. If the Planning Director makes the determination that the requested change represents a minor field change which will not adversely affect the outcome of the work and will not cause a departure from the requirements of the approved project plans or these Regulations, the Planning Director may approve the same. In instances where there is any uncertainty on the part of the Planning Director as to whether or not a requested change is significant, the Planning Director shall defer decision on approval of the requested change to the Planning Board.
93
These regulations approved by the Planning Board at their October 15, 2018 Planning Board Meeting / Public Hearing. The approved changes were to the Subdivision Regulations adding them to the Site Plan Regulations (Approved June 23, 2014) to form one complete document known as the Town of Pelham Land Use Regulations.

The public facilities for which impact fees may be assessed in Pelham may include water treatment and distribution facilities; wastewater treatment and disposal facilities; sanitary sewer; storm water, drainage and flood control facilities; the proportional share of capital facilities of the Pelham School District or a cooperative or regional school district of which Pelham becomes a member; public safety facilities; solid waste collection, transfer, recycling, processing and disposal facilities; public library facilities; public recreation facilities, municipal office facilities, public road systems and Right of Ways, or other public facilities as may be authorized by RSA 674:21, but not including public open space.
3. Prior to assessing an impact fee for one or more of the public facilities enumerated above, the Planning Board shall have adopted such studies or methodologies and related fee schedules that provide for a process or method of calculating the proportionate share of capital improvement costs that are attributable to new development. Such calculations shall reasonably reflect the capital cost associated with the increased demand placed on capital facility capacity by new development.
4. The following regulations shall govern the assessment of impact fees for public capital facilities in order to accommodate increased demand on the capacity of these facilities due to new development.
B. FINDINGS
1. The Town of Pelham is responsible for and committed to the provision of public facilities and services at standards determined by the Town to be
2
necessary to support development in a manner which protects and promotes the public health, safety and welfare;
2. Capital facilities have been and will be provided by the Town.
3. The Town’s legislative body has authorized the Planning Board to prepare and amend a Capital Improvements Program per RSA 674:5-8, and the Planning Board prepares and adopts such program.
4. An impact fee ordinance for capital facilities is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Master Plan and the Capital Improvements Program of the Town of Pelham;
5. New development in Pelham will create the need for the construction, equipping, or expansion of public capital facilities in order to provide adequate facilities and services for its residents, businesses, and other needs occasioned by the development of land;
6. Impact fees may be used to assess an equitable share of the growth-related cost of public facility capacity to new development in proportion to the facility demands created by that development;
7. In the absence of impact fees, anticipated residential and non-residential growth and associated capital improvement costs could necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds in order to maintain adequate facility standards and to promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare;
8. Impact fees assessed pursuant to this Section will not exceed the costs of:
a. Providing additional public capital facilities necessitated by new development in Pelham; and/or
b. Compensating the Town of Pelham or the Pelham School District for facility capacity that it provided in anticipation of new development in Pelham.
C. DEFINITIONS
1. Feepayer. The applicant for the issuance of a permit that would create new development as defined in this Section.
2. New Development. An activity that results in:
a. Subdivision, site development, building construction or other land use that results in an increase in demand for capital improvement facilities as
3
identified in the Planning Board’s impact fee schedules; such increases in demand for capital improvement facilities may arise from waivers granted by the Planning Board as to recreational or other facilities which the Planning Board would otherwise, in lieu of such a waiver, require the applicant to construct on-site. The dollar value of any such improvements waived by the Planning Board which result in a monetary contribution in lieu of on-site facility improvements shall constitute an impact fee.
b. The conversion of an existing use to another use if such change creates a net increase in the demand on public capital facilities that are the subject of impact fee assessment methodologies adopted by the Planning Board.
New development shall not include an addition to an existing single-family residence, the replacement or the reconstruction of a structure that has been destroyed by fire or natural disaster where there is no change in its size, density or type of use, and where there is no net increase in demand on the capital facilities of the Town of Pelham.
D. COMPUTATION OF IMPACT FEE
1. The amount of each impact fee shall be assessed in accordance with written procedures or methodologies adopted and amended by the Planning Board for the purpose of capital facility impact fee assessment in Pelham. These methodologies shall set forth the assumptions and formulas comprising the basis for impact fee assessment, and shall include documentation of the procedures and calculations used to establish impact fee schedules. The amount of any impact fee shall be computed based on the municipal capital improvement cost of providing adequate facility capacity to serve new development. Such documentation shall be available for public inspection at the Planning offices of the Town of Pelham.
2. In the case of new development created by the conversion or modification of an existing use, the impact fee assessed shall be computed based upon the net increase in the impact fee assessment for the new use as compared to the impact fee that was, or would have been, assessed for the previous use in existence on or after the effective date of this Section.
E. ASSESSMENT OF IMPACT FEES
1. Impact fees shall be assessed at the time of Planning Board subdivision or site plan approval on new development to compensate the Town of Pelham for the proportional share of the public capital facility costs generated by that development.
4
2. Any person who seeks a permit for new development, including permits is hereby required to pay the public capital facility impact fees authorized under this Section in the manner set forth herein, except where all or part of the fees are waived in accordance with the criteria for waivers established in this Section.
F. WAIVERS
The Planning Board may grant full or partial waivers of impact fees where the Board finds that one or more of the following criteria are met with respect to the particular capital facilities for which impact fees are normally assessed.
1. A person may request a full or partial waiver of school facility impact fees for those residential units that are lawfully restricted to occupancy by senior citizens per the Elderly Housing Ordinance. The Planning Board may waive school impact fee assessments on age-restricted units where it finds that the property will be bound by lawful deeded restrictions on occupancy for a period of at least 20 years.
2. The Planning Board may agree to waive all or part of an impact fee assessment and accept in lieu of a cash payment, a proposed contribution of real property or facility improvements of equivalent value and utility to the public. Prior to acting on a request for a waiver of impact fees under this provision that would involve a contribution of real property or the construction of capital facilities, the Planning Board shall submit a copy of the waiver request to the Board of Selectmen for its review and consent prior to its acceptance of the proposed contribution. The value of contributions or improvements shall be credited only toward facilities of like kind, and may not be credited to other categories of impact fee assessment. Full or partial waivers may be based on the value of exactions for on-site or off-site improvements required by the Planning Board as a result of subdivision or site plan review, and which would be required of the developer regardless of the impact fee assessments authorized by this Section, but only in the instance of on-site recreational facility exactions and limited to the extent that the exactions substantially exceed a recreation fee otherwise due under the prevailing methodology.
3. The Planning Board may waive an impact fee assessment for a particular capital facility where it finds that the subject property has previously been assessed for its proportionate share of public capital facility impacts, or has contributed payments or constructed capital facility capacity improvements equivalent in value to the dollar amount of the fee(s) waived.
4. The Planning Board may waive an impact fee assessment where it finds that, due to conditions specific to a development agreement, or other written
5
conditions or lawful restrictions applicable to the subject property, the development will not increase the demand on the capacity of the capital facility or system for which the impact fee is being assessed.
5. An applicant may request a full or partial waiver of the amount of the impact fee for a particular development based on the results of an independent study of the demand on capital facility capacity and related costs attributable to that development. In support of such request, the applicant shall prepare and submit to the Planning Board an independent fee calculation or other relevant study, and supporting documentation of the capital facility impact of the proposed development. The independent calculation or study shall set forth the specific reasons for departing from the methodologies and schedules adopted by the Town. The Planning Board shall review such study and render its decision. All costs incurred by the Town for the review of such study, including consultant and counsel fees, shall be paid by the applicant.
6. A person may request a full or partial waiver of impact fees, other than those that expressly protect public health standards, for construction within a plat or site plan approved by the Planning Board prior to the effective date of this ordinance. Prior to granting such a waiver, the Board must find that the proposed construction is entitled to the four-year exemption provided by RSA 674:39, pursuant to that statute.
G. PAYMENT OF IMPACT FEE
1. No permit shall be issued for new development as defined in this Section until the impact fee has been assessed by the Planning Board. The applicant shall either agree to pay the impact fee prior to issuance of a building permit, or shall post an impact fee performance guarantee acceptable to the Planning Board prior to the issuance of any building permit. The Planning Director shall not issue a certificate of occupancy for the development on which the fee is assessed until the impact fee has been paid in full, or has been waived by the Planning Board. In the interim between assessment and collection, the Planning Board may authorize another mutually acceptable schedule for payment, or require the deposit of an irrevocable letter of credit or other acceptable performance and payment guarantee with the Town of Pelham.
2. Where off-site capital improvements have been constructed, or where such improvements will be constructed simultaneously with, or subsequent to new development, and where the Town has appropriated necessary funds to cover such portions of the work for which it will be responsible, the Planning Office may collect the impact fee for such capital facilities at the time the building permit.
6
H. APPEALS UNDER THIS SECTION
A party aggrieved by a decision under this section may appeal such decision to the Superior Court as provided by RSA 676:5,III and RSA 677:15, as amended.
I. ADMINISTRATION OF FUNDS COLLECTED
1. All funds collected shall be properly identified and promptly transferred for deposit into separate impact fee accounts for each type of public capital facility for which impact fees are assessed. Each impact fee account shall be a non-lapsing, segregated account, and under no circumstances shall such revenues accrue in the general fund. The Town Treasurer shall have custody of all accounts.
2. The Treasurer shall record all fees paid by date of payment and the name of the person making payment, and shall maintain an updated record of the current ownership and tax map reference number of properties for which fees have been paid under this Section, for each permit so affected for a period of at least ten (10) years from the date of receipt of the impact fee payment associated with the issuance of each permit.
3. Impact fees collected may be spent, from time to time, by order of the Board of Selectmen, and shall be used solely for the reimbursement of the Town or the Pelham school district, for the cost of the public capital improvements for which they were collected, or to recoup the cost of capital improvements made by the Town or the Pelham school district in anticipation of the needs for which the impact fee was collected.
4. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments have been or will be issued by the Town of Pelham or the Pelham school district for the funding of capacity-related improvements, impact fees from the appropriate related capital facility impact fee accounts may be applied to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments.
5. At the end of each month, the Treasurer shall make a report giving a particular account of all impact fee transactions during that month. At the end of each fiscal year, the Treasurer shall make a report to the Board of Selectmen and Planning Board, giving a particular account of all impact fee transactions during that year.
J. USE OF FUNDS
1. Funds withdrawn from the capital facility impact fee accounts shall be used solely for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, equipping, or making
7
improvements to public capital facilities to increase their capacity, or to recoup the cost of such capacity improvements.
2. Impact fee monies, including any accrued interest that are not assigned in any fiscal period shall be retained in the same public capital facilities impact fee account until the next fiscal period, except where a refund is due.
3. Funds may be used to provide refunds consistent with the provisions of this Section.
K. REFUND OF FEES PAID
1. Only the current owner(s) of the property on which impact fees have been paid may apply for a full or partial refund of such fees, together with any accrued interest. The person seeking a refund shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Board and its legal counsel that they are legally entitled to receive the refund. The Planning Board reserves the right to interplead into the Superior Court by a Petition of Interpleader any refunds due if there is either a dispute or doubt as to the person entitled to receive the refund. An impact fee shall be refunded with accrued interest in the circumstances where:
a. The impact fee has not been encumbered or legally bound to be spent for the purpose for which it was collected within a period of six (6) years from the date of the full and final payment of the fee; or
b. The calculation of an impact fee has been predicated upon some portion of capital improvement costs being borne by the Town of Pelham, and the legislative body has failed to appropriate the Town’s share of the capital improvements within six (6) years of complete and final payment of the impact fee assessed.
2. The Board of Selectmen shall provide all owners of record who are due a refund written notice of the amount due, including accrued interest, if any, and shall promptly cause said refund to be made.
L. ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS
Payment of the impact fee under this Section does not restrict the Town or the Planning Board from requiring other payments from the applicant, including payments for the construction of roads or streets, or other infrastructure and public capital facilities specifically benefiting the development as required by the subdivision or site plan review regulations, or as otherwise authorized by law.
8
M. SCATTERED OR PREMATURE DEVELOPMENT
Nothing in this Section shall be construed so as to limit the existing authority of the Pelham Planning Board to deny any new proposed development which is scattered or premature, requires an excessive expenditure of public funds, or otherwise violates the Town of Pelham Zoning Ordinance, or the Pelham Planning Board site plan review regulations or subdivision regulations, or which otherwise may lawfully be denied.
N. REVIEW AND CHANGE IN METHOD OF ASSESSMENT
The methodologies adopted by the Planning Board for impact fee assessment, and the associated fee schedules, shall be reviewed periodically and amended as necessary. Such review shall take place not more than five (5) years from the initial adoption of this Section, nor more frequently than annually, except as required to correct errors or inconsistencies in the assessment formula. Failure to conduct a periodic review of the methodology shall not, in and of itself, invalidate any fee imposed. Any proposal for changes in the impact fee assessment methodology or the associated fee schedule shall be submitted to the Planning Board prior to final consideration of the proposed changes. The review by the Planning Board may result in recommended changes or adjustments to the methodology and related fees based on the most recent data as may be available. No change in the methodology or in the impact fee schedules shall be adopted by the Planning Board until it shall have been the subject of a public hearing, noticed in accordance RSA 675: 7. Any change of impact fee assessment or methodologies adopted by the Planning Board shall be submitted to the Board of Selectmen for implementation.
