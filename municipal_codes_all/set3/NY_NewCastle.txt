Chapter 2
BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT
§ 2-1. Findings and intent.
§ 2-2. Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:
BEST VALUE  The basis for awarding certain purchase contracts to
bidders or offerors which optimizes quality, cost and efficiency, among
responsive and responsible bidders. Such basis shall reflect, wherever
possible, objective and quantifiable analysis. Such basis may also identify
a quantitative factor for bidders that are small businesses, and certified
minority- or women-owned business enterprises as defined in Subdivisions
1, 7, 15 and 20 of § 310 of the Executive Law to be used in evaluation of
offers for awarding of contracts for services.
§ 2-3. Award based on best value.
A. New York General Municipal Law § 103(1) allows the Town to authorize,
by local law, the award of certain purchase contracts (including
contracts for services) subject to competitive bidding under General
Municipal Law § 103 on the basis of "best value" as defined in § 163 of
the New York State Finance Law.
B. The Town Board of the Town of New Castle hereby finds that contracts
for certain purchase contracts should be procured in a manner so as to
assure the prudent and economical use of public monies, in the best
interests of the taxpayers, to facilitate the acquisition of goods and
services of maximum quality at the lowest price possible under the
circumstances, and to guard against favoritism, extravagance, fraud
and corruption.
C. The Board finds further that while the lowest responsible bidder has
been the historically accepted method of awarding such contracts, the
lowest responsible bidder may not offer the most cost-effective or
efficient option over time. Even if the expenditure is higher, considering
the total value of the life of the procurement may result in a better value
and long-term investment of public funds. Best value procurement also
encourages competition and, in turn, often results in better pricing,
quality and customer service. Fostering healthy competition ensures
that bidders will continue to strive for excellence in identifying and
meeting the Town's needs. Best value procurement will provide
flexibility in obtaining important goods and services at favorable prices,
and will reduce the time to procure such goods and services.
A. A purchase contract shall be awarded on the basis of lowest responsible
bidder unless the applicable Town department head prepares a written
specification, prior to publication of the request for proposals,
§ 1-13 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 2-3
1:24
§ 2-4. Evaluation criteria.
providing reasons why it is in the best interests of the Town of New
Castle and its taxpayers to make an award on the basis of best value.
The use of best value shall be authorized by the Town Board in each
instance.
B. A best value solicitation shall contain a specific notification that the
solicitation will be analyzed and awarded in accordance with best value.
Such solicitations shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be considered
responsive and shall describe and disclose the general manner in which
the evaluation and selection shall be conducted.
C. The bid award shall be accompanied by a statement explaining how the
award is expected to result in savings for the Town over time and,
wherever possible, shall include objective and quantifiable analysis of
clearly described and documented criteria, which include the forgoing
enumerated criteria, as they apply to the rating of bids or offers.
A. Goods and services procured and awarded on the basis of best value are
those that the Town determines will be of the highest quality while
being the most cost-efficient as offered by responsive and responsible
bidders and offerors. The determination of quality and cost efficiency
shall be based on objectively quantified and clearly described and
documented criteria.
B. Evaluation criteria to be considered in the award of a purchase contract
on the basis of best value include, but are not limited to:
(1) The need for the costlier option as compared with all lower bids,
supported by specific facts;
(2) Cost of the option chosen as compared with all lower bids;
(3) The reputation of the bidder chosen for providing quality goods or
services;
(4) The performance, durability, reliability, product performance
criteria, quality of craftsmanship and estimated life of the goods;
(5) The estimated cost and extent of maintenance of the goods,
including availability of replacement parts or maintenance
contractors;
(6) The organization, staffing and financial capabilities of the bidder;
and
(7) The past performance record of the bidder and the bidder's
experience with similar contracts.
§ 2-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-5
1:25
§ 2-5. Applicability.
This chapter shall apply only to purchase contracts, which includes
contracts for service work, but excludes any purchase contracts necessary
for the completion of a public works contract pursuant to Article 8 of the
Labor Law.

A. Purpose. It is the policy of the Town of New Castle and the purpose of
this chapter to establish standards and guidelines for the ethical
conduct of its officers and employees. It is also the purpose of this
chapter to protect officials and employees from unwarranted
accusations that impugn their integrity by distinguishing material
conflicts of interest from those that are inconsequential, recognizing
that for local government to attract and hold competent and
professional public servants, public service must not require a complete
divesting of all proprietary interests. In the event of any conflict or
inconsistency between the provisions of this code and the provisions of
Article 18 of the General Municipal Law, this code shall prevail, except
that nothing in this code shall authorize conduct otherwise prohibited
by Article 18 of the General Municipal Law.
B. Applicability. This Code of Ethics is enacted pursuant to § 806 of the
General Municipal Law and § 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law.
Officers and employees of the Town must comply with the provisions of
the Code of Ethics, as well as the conflict of interest standards
prescribed by Article 18 of the General Municipal Law. This Code of
Ethics supplements the standards contained in Article 18, and is not
intended to authorize any conduct prohibited by Article 18 of the
General Municipal Law.

employee in the exercise or performance of his or her official
powers or duties;

receipt of the most recent gift. A "gift" does not include a lawful
campaign contribution.
E. This section does not apply to:
(1) Gifts made to the Town;
(2) Gifts from a person with a family or personal relationship with the

the gift;
(3) Gifts which are of de minimis value and customarily given on
special occasions, such as marriage, illness, or retirement;
(4) Unsolicited advertising or promotional material of little intrinsic
value, such as pens, pencils, notepads, and calendars;
(5) Awards and plaques having no resale value which are publicly

§ 9-14.1 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 10-1
1:46
§ 10-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide control and administration of
occupancy of density bonus apartments created under the multifamily
portion of Chapter 60, Zoning, for special population categories.
§ 10-2. Establishment.
The Town Board hereby establishes a Town Housing Agency, which shall be
responsible for the administration of the requirements in the Town Code
with regard to those apartments designated or restricted in a multifamily
development as a result of granting of density incentives for low or
moderate income occupancy, senior citizen occupancy, handicapped
occupancy or rental occupancy, as well as for the promulgation of such
rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement such requirements.
Until the establishment of such an agency, the Housing Advisory Committee
appointed by the Town Board shall be considered empowered to exercise all
the functions of such agency.
§ 10-3. Membership; appointments; Chairman; meetings.
A. The Agency shall consist of five members, who shall be residents of the
Town of New Castle. They shall serve without compensation and shall
be appointed by the Town Board of the Town of New Castle to serve for
a term of five years or until their successors are appointed, with no
more than two terms expiring in any one year.
B. Vacancies in such Agency shall be filled by appointment by the Town
Board in the same manner as original appointments and, where
occurring otherwise than by expiration of term, shall be for the
unexpired term of office.
C. Chairman.
(1) The Town Board shall appoint one of the members of said Agency
as its Chairman, who shall serve for a term of one year from his
appointment or until his successor is appointed, whichever is later.
(2) The Chairman shall be the executive officer of the Agency. He shall
preside at meetings of the Agency. He may appoint committees,
with Agency approval, with such duties as he may lawfully
prescribe.
D. The Agency shall hold at least three regular meetings each year and at
such other times as the Chairman may deem necessary, which meetings
shall be open to the public.
E. The Agency shall take and keep in a proper book true and correct
minutes of all meetings, and copies shall be filed with the Town Clerk.
Each member shall be notified of the time and place of all meetings at

§ 10-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 10-4
1:47
§ 10-4. Low- or moderate-income apartments.
A. Upon receipt of an application for the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy for any apartment which is located in a development for
which density incentives have been granted for low- or moderateincome
housing apartments or at such earlier time as may be requested
by the developer, but not prior to the issuance of a building permit, the
Building Inspector shall send a copy of such application to the Town
Housing Agency, which shall then inform the owner, within 30 days, of
the maximum rental or sales charge which may be established for any
low- or moderate-income apartment designated in the development and
the maximum annual gross family income for eligibility for occupancy of
said apartment.
B. No certificate of occupancy may be issued by the Building Inspector on
such a development until the Agency has notified the owner of such
maximum rental or sales charges.
C. The Agency shall certify as to the eligibility of all applicants for rental or
sales of low- or moderate-income apartments and shall annually
reexamine or cause to be reexamined each occupant family's eligibility.
An owner shall lease or sell apartment only to a person who has
received a certificate of eligibility issued by the Agency. Violations of
this provision shall constitute grounds for revocation of a certificate of
occupancy.
D. On or before March 31 of each year thereafter, the Town Housing
Agency shall notify the owner or manager of each multifamily
development containing low- or moderate-income density incentive
apartments and the owner of all such apartments of the rent, sales and
income eligibility requirements for such apartments based upon figures
derived from the preceding calendar year.
E. The owner or manager of such multifamily development and owner of
each such apartment shall certify to the Town Housing Agency on or
before May 31 of each year that the current occupancy of all density
incentive apartments complies in all respects with the terms of this
chapter.
F. Continued eligibility. Applicants for low- or moderate-income rental
apartments referred to in this section shall, if eligible and if selected for
occupancy by the owner or manager of the development, sign leases for
a term of not more than two years.
G. As long as a resident remains eligible and has complied with the terms
of the lease, said resident shall be offered a two-year renewal of the
lease. If a resident's annual gross income should subsequently exceed
by more than 20% the maximum then allowable, as defined in § 60-210
of Chapter 60, Zoning, and if there is at that time an otherwise eligible
applicant within one of the categories, said resident may complete his
current lease term and shall be offered a non-low- or moderate-rental
apartment available in the development at the termination of such
§ 10-4 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 10-4
1:48
§ 10-5. Senior citizen and handicapped apartments.
lease, if available. If no such apartment shall be available at said time,
the resident may be allowed to sign one additional year lease for
the low- or moderate-income apartment he occupies, but shall not be
offered a renewal of the lease beyond the expiration of said additional
year.
H. In the case of owner-occupied low- or moderate-income apartments, the
title to said property shall be restricted so that in the event of any resale
by the home buyer or any successor, the resale price shall not exceed
the then maximum sales price for said apartment, as determined in
accordance with Subsection F, Continued eligibility, above or the sum
of the following, whichever is greater:
(1) The amount of any principal payment made by the home buyer.
(2) The remaining principal of any mortgages.
(3) The value of any fixed improvements made by the home buyer and
not included within the above provisions.
(4) Reasonable and necessary expenses incidental to the resale.
A. The developer or owner of a project for which senior citizens or
handicapped density incentive apartments have been granted shall
transmit to the town (before issuance of a certificate of occupancy) the
following data with reference to all such density incentive dwelling
apartments in a development in sufficient detail for identification of
each apartment: building number; apartment designation; tax lot
number; approximate square foot area; location; number of rooms; the
portions of the common elements to which the apartment has
immediate access or the right to exclusive use; and the percentage of
interest in the common elements.
B. Each of the senior citizen or handicapped apartments shall be offered
for sale or lease to qualified senior citizens or handicapped persons, as
the case may be, for a period of 60 days from the date that the
developer files in the office of the Town Clerk of the Town of New Castle
a certificate or letter informing the town that the Attorney General of
the State of New York has authorized the sponsor to offer the
apartments for sale or that they are ready to be offered for rent, except,
if the developer lowers the offering price or rental amount of any of the
senior citizen or handicapped apartments, then, with respect to those
apartments only, the developer shall file a second certificate in the
office of the Town Clerk setting forth such lower price or rental, and the
new starting date shall be the date of this second filing. Upon the
expiration of the sixty-day period, any unsold or unrented senior citizen
or handicapped apartment may be offered for sale or lease by the
developer to any person, whether or not he or she is a qualified senior
citizen or handicapped person, and the Town Clerk shall, at the request
§ 10-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 10-5
1:49
of the developer, issue a certificate stating that the developer had
complied with these provisions by setting forth the applicable offering
date and terms with respect to any or all of the senior citizen and
handicapped apartments. The same procedure is to be followed
thereafter if the developer or subsequent owner desires to further
lower the selling price of the apartment or offer more favorable terms.
C. Each apartment described herein as a "senior citizen apartment" or
"handicapped person apartment," whether or not initially or hereafter
sold or leased to a qualified senior citizen or handicapped person, shall
be and and remain a senior citizen or handicapped person apartment as
the case may be and shall be subject to the following restrictions upon
its resale or rental.
(1) At such time as the owner of a senior citizen or handicapped
apartment desires to sell or lease his or her apartment, the owner
shall file a written notice in the office of the Town Clerk. The notice
shall state the name of the apartment owner, a description of the
apartment, the selling price of the apartment, the terms of sale, the
proposed closing date or the lease terms, in the case of a rental,
and the name, the telephone number and the address of the person
prospective purchasers or tenants should contact.
(2) The owner of a senior citizen or handicapped apartment may sell or
lease such apartment only to a qualified senior citizen or
handicapped person for a period of 30 days after the filing of the
notice in the office of the Town Clerk. After the expiration of the
thirty-day period, the owner may sell or lease his or her apartment
to any purchaser or tenant at a price and on terms or at a rental no
less favorable than those contained in the notice, and the Town
Clerk shall, at the request of the owner, issue a certificate stating
that the owner had complied with these provisions by setting forth
the applicable offering date and terms with respect to any or all of
the senior citizen and handicapped apartments.
(3) If the owner desires to lower the selling price or rent of the
apartment or offer more favorable terms than those set forth in the
notice, he or she shall file a second notice in the office of the Town
Clerk stating the new, more favorable price and terms of sale or
rental, as the case may be. For a period of 30 days after the filing of
the second notice, the apartment owner may sell or lease such
apartment only to a qualified senior citizen or handicapped person
at a price or rent and on terms no less favorable than those
contained in the second notice. After the expiration of the thirtyday
period, the owner may sell or lease his or her apartment to any
purchaser or tenant at a price and on terms, or at a rental no less
favorable than those contained in the notice, and the Town Clerk
shall, at the request of the owner, issue a certificate stating that the
owner has complied with these provisions by setting forth the
applicable offering date and terms with respect to any or all of the
senior citizen apartments and handicapped apartments. The same
§ 10-5 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 10-5
1:50
procedure is to be followed thereafter if the owner desires to
further lower the selling price or rent of the apartment or offer
more favorable terms.
(4) The senior citizen and handicapped apartments shall be
encumbered by the foregoing restrictions upon the initial sale of
each such apartment and upon the resale or rental of each such
apartment whether or not such apartments are sold or leased to
qualified senior citizens or handicapped persons unless such
restrictions are removed by a resolution of the Town Board of the
Town of New Castle and a declaration is filed in the office of the
County Clerk of Westchester County, Division of Land Records.
D. Nothing contained in this § 10-5 shall be deemed to supersede the
power of attorney granted by each apartment owner to the Board of
Managers of any condominium. If the Board of Managers acquires title
to or leases any senior citizen or handicapped apartment, it shall be
bound by this restriction in the further resale or rental of any such
apartment.
E. The provisions of this § 10-5 to the contrary notwithstanding:
(1) An apartment owner may transfer his or her apartment to his or her
spouse without having to follow the notice procedure set forth
above.
(2) An apartment owner may transfer his or her apartment to his or her
children or to any one or more of them without having to follow the
notice procedures set forth above, provided that the apartment
continues to be occupied by a qualified senior citizen or
handicapped person, as the case may be, and provided that within
30 days after the apartment is no longer occupied by a qualified
senior citizen or handicapped person it shall be offered in the
manner described in § 10-5C(3).
(3) An apartment owner may devise his or her apartment by will or
have it pass by intestacy, but, unless the apartment continues to be
occupied by the apartment owner's spouse or by a qualified senior
citizen or handicapped person, it shall be offered for sale in the
manner described in § 10-5C(3) within three months after the date
of the appointment of a personal representative of the deceased
apartment owner.
(4) The notice procedures set forth above shall not apply if an
apartment becomes the subject of a foreclosure, judgment or lien
sale.
(5) In any event, however, any succeeding apartment owner shall be
bound by, and his or her apartment shall be subject to, the
restrictions set forth in this § 10-5.
§ 10-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 10-6
1:51
§ 10-6. Distribution of density incentive apartments.
The density incentive apartments shall be physically integrated into the
design of the development in a manner satisfactory to the Planning Board
and shall be distributed among efficiency, one-, two-, three- or four-bedroom
apartments in the same proportion as all other apartments in the
development, unless a different proportion is approved by the Planning
Board as being better related to the housing needs, current or projected,
of the Town of New Castle. The Planning Board shall refer all development
proposals which include proposed density incentive apartments to the Town
Housing Agency for report at least 30 days prior to taking any formal
action with respect to the approval or disapproval of such density incentive
apartments.
§ 10-7. Assessment.
The encumbrance on the density incentive apartments shall be taken into
consideration by the Town Assessor in determining the full value basis for
assessments on such units.
§ 10-8. Certificates of occupancy.
All certificates of occupancy issued for apartments which have been
designated as density incentive apartments for low- or moderate-income
families, senior citizens or handicapped persons shall be endorsed with a
notation that occupancy of such apartments is conditioned upon continued
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, Chapter 60, Zoning, and all
regulations issued thereunder.

INDEMNIFICATION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES
§ 12-1. Intent.
The Town Board of the Town of New Castle has determined that in order
to ensure the continued and future service of responsible and capable

necessary and proper to assure that they are afforded protection against
individual liability for actions taken in good faith within the scope of their
duties and employment.
§ 12-2. Title.
The title of this chapter shall be "Indemnification of Public Employees."

employment in the service of the town, whether or not compensated, or a
volunteer, but shall not include an independent contractor.
§ 12-4. Defense in civil actions.
§ 12-5. Liability insurance coverage.

shall accept representation by counsel selected in accordance with the
terms of such policy.
§ 12-6. Indemnification. [Amended 11-9-1999 by L.L. No. 21-1999]
A. The town shall provide for the defense of an employee in any civil action
or proceeding in any state or federal court or administrative action,
including but not limited to a proceeding brought to enforce a provision
of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 or 1983, arising out of any alleged act or omission
which occurred or is alleged in the complaint to have occurred while
the employee was acting in good faith within the apparent scope of his
public employment or duties. This duty to provide for a defense shall
not arise where such civil action or proceeding is brought by or on
behalf of the town. [Amended 11-9-1999 by L.L. No. 21-1999]
B. Subject to the conditions set forth in Subsection A above, the employee
shall be entitled, at the option of the Town Board, to be represented by
private counsel of his choice or counsel selected by the Town Board in
any civil, judicial or administrative action or proceeding. The town may
require, as a condition to payment of the fees and expenses of such
representation, that appropriate groups of employees be represented
by the same counsel. Reasonable attorneys' fees and litigation expenses
shall be paid by the town to authorized private counsel from time to
time during the pendency of the civil action or proceeding, subject to

or in the amount of any authorized settlement of a claim, provided that
the act or omission from which such judgment or settlement arose
occurred while the employee was acting in good faith within the
apparent scope of his public employment or duties; the duty to
indemnify and save harmless prescribed by this provision shall not arise
where the injury or damage resulted from intentional wrongdoing or
recklessness on the part of the employee.
B. An employee represented by private counsel shall cause to be
submitted to the Town Board any proposed settlement which may be
§ 12-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 12-6
1:53
subject to indemnification by the town, and, if not inconsistent with
the provisions of this chapter, the Town Board shall give its approval
if in its judgment the settlement is in the best interests of the town.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to authorize the town to
indemnify or save harmless an employee with respect to a settlement
not so reviewed and approved by the Town Board.
C. Upon entry of a final judgment against an employee or upon the
settlement of the claim, the employee shall cause to be served a copy of
such judgment or settlement, personally or by certified or registered
mail within 30 days of the date of entry or settlement, upon the
Supervisor's office, and, if not inconsistent with the provisions of this
chapter, such judgment or settlement shall be certified for payment.

employee, the employee shall serve copies of such judgment,
personally or by certified or registered mail within 10 days of the
date of entry, upon the Town Attorney and upon the Town Clerk on
behalf of the Town Board. The Town Board shall meet as soon as
practicable to review, make findings and determine if all the
following have been met and, if so met, shall appropriate the funds
necessary to pay such punitive damages:
(a) The judgment of punitive damages is based on an act or
omission of an employee acting within the scope of his/her
employment;
(b) At the time of the action or omission giving rise to the liability,
the employee acted without recklessness, without
maliciousness and without gross negligence and otherwise
within the standards required for employees holding
comparable positions within the town;
(c) At the time of the act or omission, the employee acted in good
faith and in the best interests of the town; and
(d) At the time of the act or omission, the employee did not
willfully violate a clearly established provision of law or town
policy.
(2) Except as otherwise required by federal or state law, deliberations
by the Town Board shall be held in executive session and the
findings and determinations of the Town Board shall remain
confidential.
§ 12-6 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 12-7
1:54
§ 12-7. Conditions of defense.
The duty to defend or indemnify and save harmless prescribed by this
chapter shall be conditioned upon delivery to the Town Attorney by the
employee the original or a copy of any summons, complaint, process, notice,
demand or pleading within 10 days after he is served with such document
and the full cooperation of the employee in the defense of such action or
proceeding and in defense of any action or proceeding against the town
based upon the same act or omission and in the prosecution of any appeal.

provide for his defense pursuant to this chapter.

chapter shall not be construed in any way to impair, alter, limit, modify,

A. It is determined that an increasing number of alarm devices are being
installed and used in New Castle, that this has contributed to a
significant number of false alarms being made or relayed to the Police

these departments, lower the morale of their personnel and constitute a
danger to the public safety and welfare.
B. The purposes of this chapter are to regulate the use and installation of
alarm devices, promote their responsible use and reduce the number of
false alarms transmitted to the Police and Fire Departments. Among
other things, this chapter defines and provides for the registration of

entirety or in particular respects because either the applicant has failed
to comply with applicable registration requirements established by or
pursuant to this chapter or, under the provisions of this chapter, the
applicant is not entitled to the permit or official action requested. If the
alarm administrator determines not to issue or amend a permit or take
particular action requested, he shall give prompt written notice of such
determination to the applicant, indicating in such notice the basis for
the determination made. Notices hereunder shall be given by certified

D. The alarm administrator shall maintain records of all applications made
and permits issued and amended under this section and of reported
false alarms and activations of registered alarm devices. Such records
shall be kept in a format which will permit the administrator to
determine the number of false alarms, if any, which have been caused
by and charged against a registered alarm device.
E. In furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, the alarm administrator
is authorized to prescribe the form or forms to be filed and the
information to be furnished in connection with an application for
registration made under this section. Each applicant for an alarm

to the administrator all false alarms to which they respond. Each false
alarm with respect to which a charge is imposed pursuant to § 38-13
shall be supported by a written report of an investigating officer, which
report shall be furnished to the administrator and made available to the
alarm user against whom the charge is made.

Department has responded to a false alarm as a result of the activation
or reported activation of an alarm device, the administrator shall
impose a charge on the responsible alarm user in accordance with the

resolution of the Town Board in the Master Fee Schedule, which may be
amended: [Amended 9-10-2002 by L.L. No. 8-2002]

burglar alarm
See Master Fee Schedule

Second false fire alarm See Master Fee Schedule
Third false fire alarm See Master Fee Schedule
Fourth false fire alarm See Master Fee Schedule
Fifth and each subsequent false
fire alarm
See Master Fee Schedule
The charge imposed shall be computed on the basis of the number
of false alarms of the same category (fire false alarm or burglar false
alarm) recorded in the same calendar year against the alarm device
generating the false alarm; or if a specific registered alarm device
cannot be identified as the cause of the false alarm, then the charge
shall be imposed on the basis of the number of recorded false alarms
of the same category occurring in that year at the same premises.
However, in determining the amount of the charge to be imposed
under this section, the administrator shall not consider or take into
account any false alarm occurring prior to the effective date of this
section. Notice of each false alarm recorded against an alarm device
or premises shall be given to the responsible alarm user.
B. Except as otherwise herein provided, all false alarms occurring after
the effective date of this section, whether caused intentionally or not
and whether due to a malfunction of an alarm device or not, shall be
subject to the imposition of charges pursuant to this section.
C. The administrator shall notify the responsible alarm user by prompt
written notice of a false alarm charge imposed. If the false alarm occurs
at a premises within the Town of New Castle, a copy of such notice also
shall be sent, in the same manner, to each other person identified as a
record owner of the premises at which the false alarm has occurred.
Within 30 days after the mailing of such notice, the alarm user or a
record owner may contest the false alarm charge by filing with the
administrator information to show that a false alarm did not occur or
that the charge imposed was incorrectly computed and should be
modified. If any defense to a false alarm charge shall be based on a
claim that an alarm device activation was caused by a malfunction of
telephone equipment under the control of a telephone company or by
public utility system power failure, such defense shall be supported by
§ 38-13 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 38-13

§ 38-14. Excessive false alarms.
verification from the telephone company, or if by a public utility system
power failure, such defense shall be supported by verification from the
telephone company or electric utility company involved or by other
probative evidence. The administrator shall consider all information
submitted, shall afford each person contesting a charge an opportunity
for a hearing if so requested and, after any such hearing has been
held or waived, shall reaffirm, rescind or modify the false alarm charge,
notifying the alarm user and record owners of his decision. Within
20 days after the mailing of such notice, the alarm user or a record
owner may file with the Alarm Appeals Board an appeal, in writing,
but such an appeal may not be taken if the false alarm charge is not
first contested with the administrator as herein provided. [Amended
2-13-1990 by L.L. No. 12-1990]
D. Any failure of a responsible alarm user to pay a false alarm charge
imposed under and in accordance with this section within 30 days after
such charge is no longer subject to administrative appeal to or review
or decision by the Alarm Appeals Board, shall constitute an offense
against and violation of this chapter and shall subject a violator to the
penalties described in § 38-20, without affecting the obligation of such
person to pay the false alarm charge imposed.
E. All charges imposed under this section shall be paid to the Town of New
Castle and deposited to the general funds of the town.
F. All charges imposed in respect of a false alarm under this section which
remain unpaid 60 days after the date that such imposition is no longer
subject to administrative appeal to or review or decision by the Alarm
Appeals Board shall become, to the extent permitted by law, a lien upon
the property from which the false alarm originated if such property lies
within the Town of New Castle, and may be collected in such manner
and by such lawful means as may be authorized by rule or regulation
duly adopted under this chapter.
A. If activations of an alarm device result in three false alarms (of any
category or combination of categories) within a single calendar year,
the administrator shall give notice thereof to the responsible alarm
user. Such notice shall indicate that an alarm device registration permit
may be suspended or revoked pursuant to the provisions of this chapter
if activation of the alarm device for which it is issued results in five or

any other applicable provision of the Code of the Town of New Castle.
Work not in compliance with any applicable provision of the Uniform
Code, Energy Code or any other applicable provision of the Code of the
Town of New Castle shall remain exposed until such work shall have
been brought into compliance with all applicable provisions of the
Uniform Code, the Energy Code and any applicable provisions of the
Code of the Town of New Castle, re-inspected, and found satisfactory as
completed.
D. Upon completion of the foundation walls of a building, the owner or his
or her authorized agent shall submit to the Building Inspector a
certified plot plan, prepared by an engineer or land surveyor licensed to
practice in the state, showing the location of such foundation walls, the
proposed building area on the lot, the elevation, in relation to mean sea
level, of the lowest habitable floor, including basement, of all new or
substantially improved structures, whether or not such structures
contain a basement, and, if the structure is to be floodproofed, the

§ 48-13 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 48-14
1:110
§ 48-15. Building permits limited.
The issuance of a building permit shall not be deemed to authorize the
construction, erection, location or use of any temporary structure nor the
storage of any building equipment, building materials or other materials
or the location or use of a dumpster or bin for refuse and garbage other
than those temporary structures and items of equipment and materials
needed for construction work actually in progress or immediately upcoming
and only in locations as shown on a site plan or subdivision approved by
the Planning Board. Upon completion of each stage of construction, all
A. A building permit issued for other than a single-family residence shall
be void if construction is not started within a period of 12 months and
completed within a period of two years from the date of said permit. A
building permit issued for a single-family residence shall be void if
construction is not started within a period of six months and completed
within a period of 12 months from the date of said permit. Upon
completion of construction, an application for certificate of occupancy
shall be made to the Building Inspector, in accordance with the
provisions set forth in § 48-7.
B. The Building Inspector may, if good and sufficient cause for delay is
shown, grant one or more extensions of a permit for a period not to

and conditions to any extension or successive permit as he or she
deems necessary and appropriate to further the purposes and intent of
this chapter.
C. If all construction, including all interior and exterior construction, and
final grading in accordance with the approved plans, is not completed
within said period and an application for certificate of occupancy made
or if the building permit is not extended, the Building Inspector shall
notify the owner, by registered mail, to complete or remove the
incomplete structure and to remove all building equipment, building
materials and other materials from the property so as to bring the
property into compliance with § 60-420D(3) and all other applicable
requirements of this chapter and the Code of the Town of New Castle. If
the owner fails, refuses or neglects within a reasonable time after
receipt of said notice to complete or remove the incomplete structure or
the building equipment, building materials or other materials on the
property, or to complete the final grading, the Town may do so, and the
cost thereof shall be assessed against the property and added to the
next Town tax bill. If a building permit shall expire, no new building
permit shall be issued until the requirements of this section with
respect to the building permit which has expired have been fully
complied with. In addition to any other remedies available to the Town
of New Castle, failure to comply with a notice to complete or remove a
structure or to remove equipment and building materials, including
final grading, shall constitute a separate offense for each day there is
noncompliance with such an order.

temporary structures, equipment and materials no longer necessary for the
completion of the permitted structure or site development shall be promptly

Building Inspector to be contrary to any applicable provision of the
Uniform Code, the Energy Code or the Code of the Town of New
Castle, including, without limitation. Chapter 60, without regard to
whether such work is or is not work for which a building permit is
required, and without regard to whether a building permit has or
has not been issued for such work; or
(2) Any work that is being conducted in a dangerous or unsafe manner
in the opinion of the Building Inspector or Assistant Building
Inspector, without regard to whether such work is or is not work for
which a building permit is required, and without regard to whether
a building permit has or has not been issued for such work; or
(3) Any work for which a building permit is required which is being
performed without the required building permit, or under a
building permit that has become invalid, has expired, or has been
suspended or revoked; or
(4) Any work that is not in conformity with the provisions of the
application, plans or specifications on the basis of which a building
permit was issued.
B. Stop-work orders shall:
(1) Be in writing;
(2) Be dated and signed by the Building Inspector;
(3) State the reason or reasons for issuance; and
(4) If applicable, state the conditions which must be satisfied before
work will be permitted to resume.

permit holder) personally or by registered mail. The Building Inspector
or Assistant Building Inspector shall be permitted, but not required, to

property, the permit holder and any other person performing, taking
part in or assisting in the work shall immediately cease all work which
is the subject of the stop-work order.
E. The issuance of a stop-work order shall not be the exclusive remedy
available to address any event described in Subsection A of this section,
and the authority to issue a stop-work order shall be in addition to, and
not in substitution for or limitation of, the right and authority to pursue
any other remedy or impose any other penalty under § 48-50 of this
chapter or under any other applicable local law or state law. Any such
other remedy or penalty may be pursued at any time, whether prior to,
at the time of, or after the issuance of a stop-work order.
A. A certificate of occupancy shall be required for any work which is the
subject of a building permit and for all structures, buildings, or portions
thereof, which are converted from one use or occupancy classification
or subclassification to another. Permission to use or occupy a building
or structure, or portion thereof, for which a building permit was
previously issued shall be granted only by issuance of a certificate of
occupancy.
B. Application for certificate of occupancy shall be made by the fee owner
or the fee owner's authorized agent on appropriate forms which must
be obtained from the Building Inspector. Such application shall be
accompanied by a certificate of completion issued by the Westchester

§ 48-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 48-17
1:113
C. Within 10 days of receipt of a completed application, the Building
Inspector shall act thereon by either issuing the certificate or by
denying the application. In the event of such denial, the specific reasons
therefor shall be stated on the application. The Building Inspector's
written decision shall be delivered forthwith, either personally or by
certified mail, to the applicant. The Building Inspector shall inspect the
building, structure or work prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy. The Building Inspector shall issue a certificate of occupancy
if the work which was the subject of the building permit was completed
in accordance with all applicable provisions of the Uniform Code, the
Energy Code and any applicable provisions of the Code of the Town of
New Castle and, if applicable, that the structure, building or portion
thereof that was converted from one use or occupancy classification or
subclassification to another complies with all applicable provisions of
the Uniform Code, the Energy Code and any applicable provisions of
the Code of the Town of New Castle.
D. A certificate of occupancy shall contain the following information:

the certificate of occupancy.
E. The Building Inspector shall be permitted to issue a temporary
certificate allowing the temporary occupancy of a building or structure,
or a portion thereof, prior to completion of the work which is the subject
of a building permit. However, in no event shall the Building Inspector
issue a temporary certificate unless the Building Inspector determines
(1) that the building or structure, or the portion thereof covered by the
temporary certificate, may be occupied safely, (2) that any fire- and
smoke-detecting or fire protection equipment which has been installed
is operational, and (3) that all required means of egress from the
§ 48-17 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 48-17
1:114
building or structure have been provided. The Building Inspector may
include in a temporary certificate such terms and conditions as he or
she deems necessary or appropriate to ensure safety or to further the
purposes and intent of the Uniform Code. A temporary certificate shall
be effective for a period of time, not to exceed 90 days, as determined
by the Building Inspector. Temporary certificates of occupancy may be
reissued at the discretion of the Building Inspector for an additional
ninety-day period upon the payment of a second application fee as
specified in accordance with § 48-21 of this chapter, provided that
such temporary occupancy or use would not jeopardize health, life or
property. During the specified period of effectiveness of the temporary
certificate, the permit holder shall undertake to bring the building
or structure into full compliance with all applicable provisions of the
Uniform Code and the Energy Code.
F. If the Building Inspector determines that a certificate of occupancy or a
temporary certificate was issued in error because of incorrect,
inaccurate or incomplete information, and if the relevant deficiencies
are not corrected to the satisfaction of the Building Inspector within
such period of time as shall be specified by the Building Inspector, the
Building Inspector shall revoke or suspend such certificate.
G. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued in the event that a change in
occupancy or use would require an increase in the number of off-street
parking or loading spaces beyond that required for the previous use,
unless development plan approval in accordance with the standards
and procedures in § 60-440 of Chapter 60 has been obtained.
H. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a special project within
an MF Zone as set forth in Chapter 60 or for projects for which a special
permit under § 60-4300(9) (MFDRD) has been issued by the Planning
Board unless an affidavit has been filed by an engineer or architect duly
licensed by the State of New York that he or she has made regular and
periodic inspections of construction work as set forth in § 48-12E(7) of
this chapter.
I. A certificate of occupancy or use shall be deemed to authorize, and is
required for, initial, continued or changed occupancy and use of the
building or land to which it applies. It shall continue in effect as long as
such building and the use thereof and the use of land is in full
conformance with the provisions of this chapter and any requirements
made in connection therewith at the time of the issuance thereof. The
details of any plan or site plan approved by the Town Board, Planning
Board or Zoning Board of Appeals acting under the terms of the Code of
the Town of New Castle, and any conditions attached to such approval,
shall be deemed to be such requirements.
J. The fee specified in accordance with the provisions set forth in § 48-21

local laws of the town.
§ 49-3. Definitions.
A. The Town of New Castle finds that the development of cable television
and communications systems has the potential of having great benefit
and impact upon the people of New Castle. Because of the complex and
rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the town
further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare
can best be served by establishing regulatory powers which should be
vested in the town or such persons as the town shall designate. It is the
intent of this chapter and subsequent amendments to provide for and
specify the means to attain the best possible public interest and public
purpose in these matters, and any franchise issued pursuant to this
chapter shall be deemed to include this finding as an integral part
thereof.
B. Further, it is recognized that cable communications systems have the
capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to
the town's residents but can provide a variety of broadband, interactive
communications services to institutions and individuals. Many of these
services involve town agencies and other public institutions by
providing governmental, educational or health care communications.
C. For these purposes, the following goals underlie the regulations
contained herein:
(1) Communications services should be provided to the maximum
number of town residents.
(2) The system should be capable of accommodating both the present
and reasonably foreseeable future communications needs of the
town.
(3) The system should be improved and upgraded during the franchise
term so that the new facilities necessary for the operation of this
system shall be integrated to the maximum extent possible with
existing facilities as specified in the franchise.
(4) The communications system authorized by this chapter shall be
responsive to the needs and interests of the local community and
shall provide the widest possible diversity of information sources
and services to the public.

provisions contained in this chapter, the franchise agreement and other
applicable local laws.
A. In the event that the town shall grant to the grantee a nonexclusive,
revocable franchise to construct, operate and maintain a cable
communications system within the town, said franchise shall constitute
both a right and an obligation to provide the services of a cable
communications system as regulated by the provisions of this chapter

contained herein, consistent with the town's Code and/or other
applicable statutory requirements. In the event of conflict between the
terms and conditions of this chapter, the franchise or the terms and
conditions on which the town can grant a franchise, the Code and/or
statutory requirements shall control.
C. Any franchise granted by the town is hereby made subject to the
generally applicable local law provisions now in effect and hereafter
made effective; provided, however, that any amendment to this chapter
that is binding on any franchisee shall be confined to changes which do
not materially alter the rights of the franchisee under a franchise.
Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements of
the various codes and local laws of the town regarding permits, fees to
be paid or manner of construction.
§ 49-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 49-7
1:143
§ 49-7. Use of town facilities.
At the town's option, the town may require a grantee to utilize townowned
conduit or other facilities for any portion of its cable communications
system during the initial construction of the system, provided that the cost
of construction is not materially increased due to the use of town-owned
facilities. The consideration for the use of town conduit or other facilities
shall be as stated in the franchise. A reasonable fee for the use of town
facilities shall be established in the franchise and may be adjusted at the
periodic performance evaluations.
§ 49-8. Use of grantee facilities.
No poles shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval of the
town with regard to location, height, type and any other pertinent aspect.
However, no location of any pole of the grantee shall be a vested right,
and such poles shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its own
expense whenever the town determines that the public convenience would
be enhanced thereby. The grantee shall utilize existing poles and conduits,
where possible. The town shall have the right during the life of the franchise
to install and maintain, free of charge, upon the poles owned by the grantee,
any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable

it deems appropriate.
§ 49-12. Acts to be performed on schedule.
Whenever the agreement shall establish a separate schedule of specific acts
by or on behalf of the grantee, these shall be deemed of the essence, and
any failure of the grantee to perform within the time allotted shall always
be sufficient ground for the town to invoke an appropriate penalty including
possible revocation of the franchise.
§ 49-7 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 49-13
1:144
§ 49-13. Statute to prevail.
In any controversy or dispute under this chapter, the law of the State of New
York shall apply.
§ 49-14. Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this
chapter or the franchise is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional
by any court of competent jurisdiction or by any federal, state or local

independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the

prior consent of the town, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
B. The grantee shall promptly notify the town of any actual or proposed
transfer.
C. Every transfer shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless
the town shall have consented thereto. For the purpose of determining

party, consistent with Federal Communications Commission rules, and
the grantee shall assist the town in any such inquiry.

franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the
construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to
notify the town that it or its designees satisfactory to the town will take
control and operate the cable television system. Further, said financial
institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will ensure
continued service and compliance with all franchise obligations during
the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The
financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a
period exceeding one year, unless extended by the town at its
discretion, and during said period of time, it shall have the right to
petition for transfer of the franchise to another grantee. If the town
finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character,
technical and other public interest qualifications of the applicant, is
satisfactory, the town will transfer and assign the rights and obligations
of such franchise as in the public interest. The consent of the town to
such transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld.
E. The consent or approval of the town to any transfer of the grantee shall
not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the town in and to the
§ 49-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 49-15
1:145
§ 49-16. Franchise renewal discretionary.
Upon completion of the term of any franchise granted under this chapter,
the town may, in its sole discretion, grant or deny renewal of the franchise of
the grantee in accordance with the provisions of the Cable Act. The grantee

streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise.
F. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the town will not
approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion
of construction of the proposed system.
G. The town shall have 120 days from the time specified under federal law
to act upon any request for approval of such sale or transfer that
contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in
accordance with Federal Communications Commission regulations and
by the town. If the town fails to render a final decision on the request
within 120 days, such request shall be deemed granted, unless the
requesting party and the town agree to an extension of time. In the
event that the town refuses to grant the aforementioned request, it
shall set forth specific reasons for its decision, in writing, by municipal
resolution.
H. In determining whether to approve said request, the town may consider
the following:
(1) The experience of the proposed assignee or transferee (including
conducting an investigation of the proposed assignee's or
transferee's service record in other communities).
(2) The qualifications of the proposed assignee or transferee.
(3) The legal integrity of the proposed assignee or transferee.
(4) The financial ability and stability of the proposed assignee or
transferee.
(5) The ability and express commitment of the proposed assignee or
transferee to fully comply with the provisions of this agreement.
I. A copy of the completed sales agreement, or a functionally equivalent
instrument, between the grantee and proposed transferee or assignee
shall be available to the town for inspection at the grantee's local office,
upon request of the latter.
J. The town may approve said petition contingent on compliance with
additional standards, terms or conditions within its legal authority and
consistent with findings resulting from its review of the aforementioned
petition.
§ 49-15 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 49-17
1:146
§ 49-17. Police powers.
§ 49-18. Franchise fees.
A. In accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges that its rights
hereunder are subject to the police power of the town to adopt and
enforce general local laws necessary to the safety and welfare of the
public, and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and
local laws enacted by the town pursuant to such power.
B. Any conflict between the provisions of this chapter or the franchise and
any other present or future lawful exercise of the town's police powers
shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise
that is not of general application in the jurisdiction or applies
exclusively to the grantee or cable communications systems which
contain provisions inconsistent with this chapter shall prevail only if,
upon such exercise, the town finds an emergency exists constituting a
danger to health, safety, property or general welfare and such exercise
is mandated by law.
A. Establishment. Because the town finds that the streets of the county,
state and town to be used by the grantee in the operation of its system
within the boundaries of the franchise area are valuable public
properties acquired and maintained by the county, state and town at
great expense to its taxpayers; the grant to the grantee to said streets is
a valuable property right without which the grantee would be required
to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions; and
the administration of this chapter and the franchise imposes upon the
town additional regulatory responsibility and expense, a grantee of any
franchise hereunder shall pay to the town a franchise fee in an amount
as designated in the franchise but in no event less than 5% of the gross
annual revenues or the maximum amount permitted under applicable
federal, state or local law, if such maximum is greater than 5% less the
annual assessment paid by the grantee to the New York State
Commission on Cable Television. The annual franchise payment shall be
in addition to any other fee and shall commence as of the effective date
of the franchise. The town shall be furnished a statement of said
payment by a certified public accountant reflecting the total amounts of
annual gross revenues and the above charges and computations for the
period covered by the payment.
B. Franchise fee in addition to other tax or payment. This payment shall be
in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the governments or
other taxing jurisdiction by the grantee.
C. Acceptance by the town. No acceptance of any payment by the town
shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any
claim the town may have for further or additional sums payable as a
franchise fee under this chapter or for the performance of any other
obligation of the grantee.
§ 49-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 49-18
1:147
§ 49-19. Forfeiture and revocation.
D. Failure to make required payment. In the event that any franchise
payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates
specified herein, the grantee shall pay as additional compensation an
interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal
to the commercial prime interest rate of the town's primary depository
bank during the period that such unpaid amount is owed.
E. Payments to be made quarterly. The franchise fee and any other cost or
damage assessed against the grantee shall be payable quarterly to the
Town of New Castle. The grantee shall file a complete and accurate
verified statement of all gross revenues within the franchise area
during the period for which said quarterly payment is made, and said
payment shall be made to the town no later than 45 days following the
end of each calendar quarter. Quarterly computation dates are the last
day in the months of March, June, September and December.
F. The town's right of inspection. The town shall have the right to inspect
the grantee's income records and the right to audit at its own expense
determined to be payable under this chapter. However, in the event that
the audit concludes that the grantee's payments hereunder were
underpaid by an amount greater than 5% of the proper payment, then
the grantee shall reimburse the town for the costs of said audit, in
addition to making any additional payments required to bring the
grantee into compliance with this section. At the sole discretion of the
town, the latter may collect interest from the grantee on the
underpayment or any other late payment at a rate equal to the prime
rate plus 3%.
A. Grounds for revocation. The town reserves the right to revoke any
franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges
associated with the franchise in the following circumstances, each of
which shall represent a default and breach under this chapter and the
franchise grant:
(1) If the grantee shall default in the performance of any of the
material obligations under this chapter or under such documents,
contracts and other terms and provisions entered into by and
between the town and the grantee.
(2) If the grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and
effect the liability and indemnification coverage or the performance
bond as required herein.
(3) If the grantee shall violate any lawful orders or rulings of any
regulatory body having jurisdiction over the grantee relative to this
chapter or the franchise.
§ 49-18 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 49-19
1:148
(4) If the grantee evades, as defined in state law, any of the provisions
of this chapter or the franchise or practices any fraud or deceit
upon the town or cable subscribers.
(5) If the grantee fails to meet the construction schedule contained in
the franchise or beyond any extended date set by the town.
(6) If the grantee fails to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of
interrupted service, except when approval of such interruption is
obtained from the town.
(7) If there is material misrepresentation of fact in the application for
or negotiation of the franchise or any extension or renewal thereof.
(8) If the grantee ceases to provide all services for any reason within
the control of the grantee over the cable communications system.
B. Effect of circumstances beyond control of grantee. The grantee shall
not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any
provision of this chapter in any case in which performance of any such
provision is prevented for reasons beyond the grantee's control. A fault
shall not be deemed to be beyond the grantee's control if committed by
a corporation or other business entity in which the grantee holds a
controlling interest, whether held directly or indirectly.
C. Pending litigation. Pending litigation or any appeal to any regulatory
body or court having jurisdiction over the grantee shall not excuse the
grantee from the performance of its obligations under this chapter or
the franchise. Failure of the grantee to perform such obligations
because of pending litigation or petition may result in forfeiture or
revocation pursuant to the provisions of this section.
D. Procedure prior to revocation.
(1) The town shall make written demand that the grantee comply with
any such requirement, limitation, term condition, rule or regulation
or correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If the failure,
refusal or neglect of the grantee continues for a period of 30 days
following such written demand, the town shall place its request for
termination of the franchise upon a regular Town Board meeting
agenda. The town shall cause to be served upon such grantee, at
least seven days prior to the date of such Town Board meeting, a
written notice of this intent to request such termination and the
time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published by
the Town Clerk at least once, seven days before such meeting, in a
newspaper of general circulation within the town.
(2) The Town Board shall hear any persons interested therein and shall
determine, in its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal or
neglect by the grantee was with just cause.
§ 49-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 49-19
1:149
(3) If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just

other public ways and places. No pole or other fixtures placed in any
public ways by the grantee shall be placed in such a manner as to
interfere with normal travel on such public way.

Supervisor may deem necessary. The content and format of the report
will be determined by the Town Supervisor and may be modified at his/
her discretion.
B. Such written progress reports shall be submitted to the town on a
monthly basis throughout the entire construction process. The Town
Supervisor may require more frequent reporting if he/she determines it
is necessary to better monitor the grantee's progress.
C. Prior to the commencement of any system construction, the grantee
shall produce an informational document to be distributed to all
residents of the area to be under construction, which shall describe the
activity that will be taking place. The informational document shall be
reviewed and approved by the Town Supervisor prior to its distribution.

completion.
E. Whenever there have been similar complaints made or when there
exists other evidence, which, in the judgment of the town, casts doubt
on the reliability or quality of the grantee's system, the town shall have
the right and authority to compel the grantee to test, analyze and report
on the performance of its system. The town may require additional
tests, full or partial repeat tests, different test procedures or tests
involving a specific subscriber's terminal. Reports on such tests shall be
delivered to the town no later than 14 days after the town formally
notifies the grantee and shall include the nature of the complaints
which precipitated the special tests; what system component was
tested; the equipment used and procedures employed in said testing;
the results of such tests; and methods by which said complaints were
resolved. Said tests and analyses shall be supervised by a professional
engineer not on the permanent staff of the grantee who shall sign all

CABLE TELEVISION RATE REGULATION
§ 50-1. Filing and review of rates.
The town shall follow the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) rate
regulations in its regulation of the basic service rates and charges of
Continental Cablevision and/or any other franchisee hereafter operating in
the town notwithstanding any different or inconsistent provisions in any
cable franchise.
A. A franchisee that is notified that its basic service and equipment rates
are subject to rate regulation shall file, within 30 days of notification
(but not earlier than November 15, 1993), a submission (hereinafter the
"rate filing") as required by FCC rate regulations. The franchisee's rates
affected by such notice shall not be subject to increase except with the
prior approval of the town or as provided by FCC rate regulations.
B. Every rate filing shall be submitted to the Town Clerk, 200 South
Greeley Avenue, Chappaqua, New York 10514. Four copies of the filing
are required to be submitted. If the operator claims any part of the
filing is proprietary, it shall file four additional copies, which shall omit
the proprietary information.
C. If external costs are included in the rate filing and/or if different rates
for classes of customers are proposed, the rate filing is required to
show how the rates are consistent with FCC rate regulations. A
franchisee shall respond to requests for information from the town by
deadlines established by the town.
D. If the town finds that the initial rates and/or any subsequent rate
increases are within the FCC rate regulation standards, the rates shall
be effective 30 days after submission of the rate filing.
E. If the town is unable to determine whether the rate at issue is within the
FCC's benchmark standards, based on the material submitted by the
franchisee, or if the franchisee submitted a cost of service showing, the
town may take an additional period of time to make a final
determination and toll the effective date of the proposed rates for a
commensurate period. The town may take an additional 90 days if it
needs more time to ensure that a rate is within the FCC's benchmark
rate standards. The town may take an additional 150 days to evaluate a
cost-of-service showing. The town shall issue a written decision
regarding its invocation of the additional time period and shall so notify
the franchisee. If no action is taken within the above-referenced time
periods, the proposed rates shall go into effect, subject to subsequent
refund orders, if the town later issues a decision disapproving any
portion of the proposed rates.
§ 49-50 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 50-1
1:185
§ 50-2. Public inspection of rate filings.
In connection with such regulation and except where nondisclosure of
information is authorized and necessary, the town shall provide for public
inspection of the rate filing and ensure a reasonable opportunity for
consideration of the views of interested parties, including but not limited to
the following.
F. The Town Board shall issue a written decision on its findings in
compliance with the FCC rate regulations. If rates are in excess of the
FCC rate regulations, the rates may be reduced by the town pursuant to
applicable FCC rate regulations.
G. After the initial rate regulation procedures are followed, any franchisee
shall, in conjunction with each change in basic service rates and
charges, conform to FCC rate regulations.
H. Every rate approved or prescribed shall be subject to further reduction
and refund, as allowed by FCC rate regulations.
I. A franchisee shall be subject to all applicable penalties and forfeitures
under the town's franchise and FCC rate regulations.
J. A franchisee is required to serve the town with all filings made by the
franchisee to the FCC related to the regulation of basic service rates
and charges in the town.
A. After receiving a rate filing, the Town Clerk or his/her designee shall
promptly publish a public notice that a filing has been received and
that, except for those parts which may be withheld as proprietary
pursuant to federal and/or state law, it is available for public inspection.
The notice shall state that interested parties may comment on the filing
and shall provide for any and all interested parties to submit written
comments on the filing to the Town Clerk or his/her designee during the
comment period. The comment period shall be 10 days and shall
commence on the date the notice is provided. The franchisee may
submit responses to comments by interested parties during the
comment period and for five days thereafter.
B. If the town extends the period for its review by 90 days for a benchmark
showing or 150 days for a cost-of-service showing or for a longer period
as allowed by FCC rate regulations, the period for comment by
interested parties shall be extended for a twenty-day period
commencing on the day the written decision extending the time period
is issued. The franchisee may respond to comments by interested
parties during such comment period and for five days thereafter.
C. If the town prepares a public document analyzing the rate filing, such
document shall be made available to the franchisee. The franchisee
shall have three days, or such longer period as specified by the town, to
file a response with the town. Prior to prescribing a rate or a refund, the
§ 50-1 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 50-2

§ 50-3. Authority of Town Supervisor to implement FCC rate
regulations.
The Town Supervisor or his/her designee is authorized on behalf of the
town to execute and file with the FCC such submissions as are now or may
hereafter be required by FCC rate regulations in order to regulate basic
service rates and charges and to establish any additional procedures for the
town and the franchisee in conformity with FCC rate regulations. The town
may utilize a rate consultant to advise it on proposed rate changes and to
assist it in the procedures and the standards for review adopted by the FCC.
A rate consultant may be any person who has sufficient background and
experience, in the sole opinion of the town, to properly evaluate and analyze
rates and charges.
§ 50-4. Proprietary information.
town shall provide the franchisee with an opportunity to comment on
the proposed rate or refund.
D. Notice of the public comment period for interested parties shall be
provided in accordance with local law.
A. If these provisions or any request for information requires the
production of proprietary information, the franchisee is required to
produce the information. However, a franchisee may request that
specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential
and withheld from public disclosure. The franchisee must state the
reasons why the information should be treated as proprietary and the
facts that support those reasons. The request for confidentiality will be
granted if the town determines that nondisclosure is consistent with the
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, FCC rate
regulations and the New York State law, where applicable. If the
franchisee requests confidentiality and request is denied, where the
franchisee is proposing a rate increase, it may withdraw the proposal,
in which case the allegedly proprietary information will be returned to
it; or the franchisee may seek review within five working days of the
denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information will be
stayed until such time as disclosure is required by law.
B. A request by any interested person or party for public disclosure and
inspection of material withheld by the town as proprietary shall be
governed by the aforementioned federal and state law, where
applicable. The town will notify the franchisee of the disposition of any
request for public disclosure of information claimed by the franchisee,
and withheld by the town, as proprietary information. The requesting
party or the franchisee may seek review of any decision by the town
regarding proprietary information, by filing an appeal with the
appropriate form, as required by law. Disclosure of the information in
question will be stayed pending resolution of any appeal.

A. In February 2008, the Town of New Castle became the first municipality
in the State of New York to adopt the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation's "Climate Smart Communities" pledge, a
ten-measure commitment to encourage renewable energy, to increase
§ 53-10 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 54-1
1:192
§ 54-2. Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:
recycling efforts, and to incorporate climate change sustainability, and
the use of environmentally sound goods and services within all
development plans. In April 2011 the Town Board adopted a Climate
Action Plan.
B. In accordance with the goals and objectives of the Climate Smart
Communities Pledge and the Town's Climate Action Plan, the Town
Board seeks to conserve resources, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, waste, litter and pollution. An important part of that goal is
to procure and use sustainable products and services.
C. The Town Board finds that the use of single-use carryout bags (plastic,
paper, and biodegradable) has negative environmental impacts,
including GHG emissions, litter, water consumption, solid waste
generation and effects on wildlife and that numerous studies have
documented the prevalence of single-use carryout bags littering the
environment, blocking storm drains and fouling beaches. Single-use
plastic bags do not biodegrade but instead break down into smaller
pieces that are ingested by marine animals and make their way into the
food chain. Furthermore, the manufacturing, transport, recycling and/
or disposal of paper bags require significant environmental resources.
D. The Town Board believes that, from an overall environmental and
economic perspective, a shift to reusable bags is a better alternative to
the continued use of single-use plastic and paper carryout bags. Similar
policies adopted in other jurisdictions have resulted in significant
reductions in the use of single-use carryout bags. The Town Board finds
that such a shift in use shall be a benefit to the overall health, safety and
welfare of the Town of New Castle, its residents and the local
environment.
E. The Town Board also finds that a carryout bag fee is an essential
element of the movement away from single-use carryout bags because
it will discourage customers from using single-use carryout bags when
shopping at regulated stores and will encourage a shift towards the use
of reusable bags. Any costs incurred by applicable businesses, as
defined herein, in providing paper bags and reusable bags will be at
least partially offset by the monetary proceeds from the carryout bag
fee. Furthermore, such fee is not a tax because the monetary proceeds
will be retained by the retail establishments and this chapter shall not
specify how the retailers must expend the monies collected.
F. Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, the Town Board has decided to
adopt a new chapter of the Town Code designed to limit and discourage
the use of disposable single-use carryout bags and incentivize the use of
reusable carryout bags.

Program  See Ch. 63.
§ 55-1. Legislative findings; intent and purpose; authority.
F. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit customers from using bags of any
type that they bring to the store themselves or from carrying away
goods that are not placed in a bag.
A. It is the policy of both the Town of New Castle and the State of New
York to reduce costs and provide cost certainty for the purpose of
economic development, to promote deeper penetration of energy
efficiency and renewable energy resources such as wind and solar, and
wider deployment of distributed energy resources as well as to examine
the retail energy markets and increase participation of and benefits for
residential and small commercial customers in those markets. Among
the policies and models that may offer benefits in New York is
community choice aggregation, which allows local governments to
determine the default supplier of electricity and natural gas on behalf of
its residential and small commercial customers.
B. The purpose of this CCA Program is to allow participating local
governments, including the Town of New Castle, to procure energy
supply service for their residential and small commercial customers,
who will have the opportunity to opt out of the procurement, while
maintaining transmission and distribution service from the existing
distribution utility. This chapter establishes a program that will allow
the Town of New Castle to put out for bid the total amount of natural
gas and/or electricity being purchased by local residential and small
commercial customers. Bundled customers will have the opportunity to
have more control to lower their overall energy costs, to spur clean
energy innovation and investment, to improve customer choice and
value, and to protect the environment; thereby, fulfilling the purposes of
this chapter and fulfilling an important public purpose.

A. A Community Choice Aggregation (Energy) Program is hereby
established by the Town of New Castle, whereby the Town of New
Castle shall work together with Sustainable Westchester to implement
the CCA Program to the full extent permitted by the Order, as set forth
more fully herein. The Town of New Castle's role under the CCA
Program involves the aggregating of the electric and/or natural gas
supply of its residents and the entering into a contract with one or more
suppliers for supply and services. Under the CCA Program, the
operation and ownership of the utility service shall remain with the
distribution utility.
B. The Town of New Castle's purchase of energy supply through a CCA
Program constitutes neither the purchase of a public utility system, nor
the furnishing of utility service. The Town of New Castle will not take
over any part of the electric or gas transmission or distribution system
and will not furnish any type of utility service, but will instead negotiate
with suppliers on behalf of participating residential and small
commercial customers.
C. In order to implement the CCA Program, the Town will adopt one or
more resolutions that outline the process of and conditions for
participation in the CCA Program, including but not limited to signing a
contract for a compliant bid with one or more suppliers, all as
consistent with the chapter and the Order.
D. The Public Service Commission supervises retail markets and
participants in these markets through legislative and regulatory
authority and the Uniform Business Practices, which includes rules
relating to the eligibility of participating ESCOs, the operation by which
ESCOs provide energy services, and the terms on which customers may
be enrolled with ESCOs.
A. As permitted by the Order, the Town of New Castle may request from
the distribution utilities aggregated customer information by fuel type
and service classification on a rolling basis.
B. Sustainable Westchester, on behalf of the Town of New Castle, shall
issue one or more requests for proposals to Suppliers to provide energy
to participants and may then award a contract in accordance with the
CCA Program.

C. Sustainable Westchester or the Town of New Castle, if the Town so
chooses, will then request individual customer data from the
distribution utility in accordance with the CCA Program.
D. Sustainable Westchester or the Town of New Castle, if the Town so
chooses, and the selected supplier will then notify bundled customers of
the contract terms and their opportunity to opt out of the CCA Program.
E. In accordance with and for purposes of the Order, the existing
distribution utility, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., will
provide to Sustainable Westchester aggregate and customer-specific
data (including usage data, capacity tag obligations, account numbers,
and service addresses) of all bundled customers in the Town of New
Castle not currently enrolled with an ESCO.
F. Sustainable Westchester and the Town of New Castle, will protect
customer information as required by law, subject to the Order and the
limitations of the New York State Freedom of Information Law.
A. The Town of New Castle or in conjunction with the ESCO will notify its
residential and small commercial customers, by letter notice, of the
Town's decision to establish the CCA Program, of the contract terms
with an ESCO, and of the opportunity to opt out of the CCA Program.
B. The letter notice will be sent to each customer at the address provided
by the distribution utility and explain the CCA Program and the
material provisions of the ESCO contract, identify the methods by
which the customer can opt out of the CCA Program, and provide
information on how the customer can access additional information
about the CCA Program.
C. The opt-out period shall be twenty (20) days.
D. CCA Program bundled customers, upon enrollment, will receive a
welcome letter that will explain the customers' options for canceling
the enrollment if they believe they were enrolled incorrectly or
otherwise decide to withdraw from the CCA Program in favor of another
supplier. The welcome letter also will explain that residential customers
are entitled to the added protection of the mandated three-day
rescission period as detailed in Section 5(B)(3) of the Uniform Business
Practices.
A. Sustainable Westchester shall be responsible for filing an annual report
with the Public Service Commission, which identifies the number of
customers enrolled in the CCA Program by municipality and customer
class, the number of customers who returned to utility service or
service with another supplier during the reporting period, and the
average cost of commodity supply by month for the reporting period.

A. Findings; purpose and intent.
(1) The Town Board of the Town of New Castle hereby finds that it is in
the long-term interests of the Town to encourage the orderly and
attractive development of the Millwood Hamlet Business Center by
establishing supplementary design guidelines that are intended to
strengthen and improve the functioning of that center. The Town
Board further finds that it is desirable to establish such guidelines
for the purposes of enhancing the visual character of the Millwood
Hamlet Business Center and developing a coordinated, unified
appearance within it. Pursuant to the general authority granted
under § 261 of the Town Law, the Town Board hereby finds that it is
necessary and appropriate to establish an overlay district in order
to implement such goals.
(2) It is further declared to be the purpose of this subsection to
implement the design guidelines that are incorporated by
reference in the Millwood Center Area Design Plan adopted by the
Town of New Castle Planning Board on May 18, 1993, as further
amended on March 2, 1999, which plan sets forth the following
specific objectives:
(a) To maintain a small scale of commercial development, which
exhibits a residential character.
(b) To introduce pedestrian-scale elements and emphasize
features that encourage walking within the hamlet center,
§ 60-330 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-350
1:241
while still accommodating necessary vehicular circulation
functions.
(c) To orient buildings toward the street side of a property, with
rear entrances to be used only for service and safety purposes.
(d) To encourage irregular building forms and the creation of
pedestrian walkways and courtyards to avoid the creation of
unimaginative strip development.

treatments.

B. Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in §§ 60-360 and
60-360.8.4A(ii) establishing a minimum occupancy requirement of
25,000 square feet for indoor health or fitness uses, this square footage
requirement shall be reduced upon a showing to the Town Board's
reasonable satisfaction, no earlier than three years after issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for 25,000 square feet of health or fitness uses,
that any single fitness tenant occupying such required minimum 25,000
square feet ("single fitness tenant") has ceased operating said fitness
use due to its inability to maintain an economically sustainable business
and thereafter has made a good faith effort for not less than six months
after said three-year period to re-lease such space to other health or
fitness tenants in an effort to meet the minimum occupancy
requirement of 25,000 square feet, with such reduction being in the
minimum amount shown to be warranted by the aforementioned good
faith effort to meet the minimum occupancy requirement of 25,000
square feet, and with such reduction, not to include any existing and
operational health or fitness tenant occupying less than 25,000 square
feet.
C. For any application made pursuant to § 60-360.8.4B seeking a reduction
of the minimum occupancy requirement of 25,000 square feet for
indoor health or fitness uses, the following procedures and
requirements shall apply:
(1) The applicant shall demonstrate that it engaged a licensed real
estate brokerage firm with (a) a national footprint of locations, (b) a
local office within 50 miles of New Castle, and (c) at least 50
licensed brokers under its employ, to undertake the requisite good
faith effort continuing for not less than six months to re-lease, in

(2) The applicant shall demonstrate that it implemented a marketing
and leasing campaign for a continuous period of not less than six
months, which campaign included, without limitation, (a)

space vacated by the single fitness tenant and provided said
operators with marketing materials relating to the space;
(4) The applicant shall demonstrate that throughout the
aforementioned six-month marketing and leasing campaign, the
asking rent for the space vacated by the single fitness tenant was
not greater than rent charged by comparable premises within 10
miles of the space in question, and in no event greater than the
current rent obligation set forth in the lease of the single fitness
tenant; and
(5) The applicant must agree to pay any financial obligations arising

A. Site planning. Where an Office Park Retail Overlay District is sought to
be established on property presently used or approved for a mix of
office and residential uses, a site plan for the proposed future mixed use
of the entire property shall be submitted and approved as a condition of
preliminary development concept plan approval. Such site plan shall
conform with the design and conditions, if any, of the approved PDCP
and, to the greatest extent practicable, incorporate Traditional
Neighborhood Design (TND) principles and standards intended to
diversify and integrate land uses within close proximity to each other,
and provide for recreational and shopping needs of the community.
TND elements include, but are not limited to:
(1) A mix of uses that could include residential, retail, commercial,
civic, and open spaces uses in close proximity to one another,
jointed together as a two-sided "main street" environment, with
open store fronts onto the "main street" and located in close
proximity to adjacent residential development. Such a "main
street" is to be a two-lane limited distance thoroughfare, providing
for such uses as mixed-use retail, commercial and civic. Sidewalks
should include street trees, pedestrian scale lighting and "main
street" amenities such as benches and bicycle racks.
(2) A system of relatively narrow, interconnected streets, roads, drives,
and other thoroughfare types with sidewalks and bikeways, that
offer multiple routes for motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists and
provides for the connections of those thoroughfare types to existing
and future development.
§ 60-360.8.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-360.8.5

public's active and passive recreation needs.
(6) Architecture, landscape, lighting and signage that respond to the
unique character of the site.
(7) Parallel parking may be placed on the "main street." Parking lots
placed directly fronting a street should be avoided. If unavoidable,
they should be screened. Off-street parking between building fronts
and the street should be avoided.
B. The preliminary location and design of buildings and improvements in
the Office Park Retail Overlay District shall be included as part of the
preliminary development concept plan for the Office Park Retail
Overlay District and approved by the Town Board as part of its approval
of the preliminary development concept plan.
C. Design of buildings and other improvements and architecture in an
Office Park Retail Overlay District shall be consistent with and
complement one another and the design of the other buildings and
improvements in the balance of the underlying Office Park District and
otherwise consistent with the following guidelines:
(1) The historic architectural character and iconic features of existing
buildings should be preserved and/or respected in any proposed
adaptive re-use.
(2) Visual harmony and unity should be achieved by the use of similar
building materials, forms, colors, and scale in the Office Park Retail
Overlay District as are found in the underlying Office Park District.
(a) Standard brick, as opposed to concrete block or siding, should
be used.
(b) Large areas of unbroken materials such as stucco, paneling,
stone, glass, or plastic should not be used generally.
(c) Windows generally should be broken into smaller elements by
vertical and horizontal mullions.

decorative street lights, and vaults for underground utilities should
be installed as part of any sidewalk construction, even if the vaults
are not to be used initially.
(5) All dumpster and trash storage areas should be enclosed or
screened from view with a fence and secure gate.
A. Signage in an Office Park Retail Overlay District shall:
(1) Further the objectives set forth in § 60-410D(1) through (8) of this

to the others in the Office Park Retail Overlay District and
in the underlying Office Park District. They should not
cover architectural features such as columns, cornices,
decorative elements, or windows.
[2] The location for display of signs should be an integral part
of the architecture of a building.
(b) Signs should be of a scale that gives due regard to the
character of the surrounding neighborhoods and still is in
keeping with the visual environment of the underlying Office
Park District and the Office Park Retail Overlay District.
(c) The color intensity of all signs should be consistent with the
colors used in the Office Park Retail Overlay District and the
underlying Office Park Retail Overlay District.

permitted.
[3] Hours of illumination of signage adjoining residential
areas shall be limited to not later than the close of
business for the establishment displaying the illuminated
sign.
[4] Interior illumination of a sign shall not be permitted unless
such illumination is confined to the sign's lettering and/or
symbols, except that the illumination of the background
area of a sign with interior illumination may be permitted,
provided that the applicant can demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the approving authority that such lighting
will not result in a level of illumination or glare such that
the sign may cause a distraction to motorists or negatively
impact surrounding properties. Where interior
illumination of a sign's background materials is sought, the
applicant shall bear the burden of proof of demonstrating
compliance with the above standards.
[5] Illuminated sign bands, and illuminated traffic directional
signs with retail tenant names within parking lots and
internal drives, shall be permitted where conceptually
approved by the Town Board in the preliminary
development concept plan or by separate resolution, or by
the Planning Board in its site development plan approval.
(e) Sign types:
[1] All uses should be required to display a sign identifying the
name of their business.
[2] Signs depicting types of use(s) in graphic form are
encouraged and should be either affixed to or hung on the
buildings to add visual interest to the shopping
environment.
[3] Either a bracket sign or a wall sign should be permitted for
any use.
(3) A conceptual signage plan shall be part of the preliminary
development concept plan for the Office Park Retail Overlay
District, but final approval of signage shall be part of the Planning
Board's site development plan approval.

(a) Submission of a parking accumulation study to the Planning
Board, and if the Planning Board determines on the basis
thereof that additional parking spaces are required to
accommodate the demand of the new use, then land banked
spaces must be made available for use.

(14) Sign computations.
(a) The area of an individual sign face shall be determined by the
smallest circle or polygon that can be drawn to include all
lettering, symbols, accompanying designs, framing and
background coloring that differentiates the sign from the
structure to which it is attached, except that the structural
supports and braces for a freestanding sign or a bracket sign
shall not be included in determining sign area unless such
31.Editor's Note: This local law also renumbered former subsections (f), (g) and (h) as (g),
(h) and (i), respectively.
§ 60-410 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-410
1:271
structural supports constitute an integral part of the sign's
aesthetic design. In the case of a sidewalk sign, the area of
such sign face shall be determined by including the frame,
easel and any or other method of displaying on supporting such
sidewalk sign. [Amended 7-13-2004 by L.L. No. 6-2004]
(b) The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be
computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible
from any one point. However, notwithstanding the above, when
two sign faces are placed back-to-back more than two feet
apart, each sign face shall constitute an individual sign.
(c) The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the
base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest
attached component of the sign. As applied to signage
regulated under this chapter, normal grade shall be the lower
of one of the following:
[1] The existing grade prior to construction; or
[2] The newly established grade after construction, exclusive
of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating
undertaken solely for the purpose of locating the sign.
(d) The total (aggregated) sign area shall be computed by first
calculating the sign area, as set forth in § 60-410D(14)(a) and
(b) herein, of each existing and proposed sign for a single use,
and comparing the area calculated for each sign to the
maximum sign area permitted for that sign type in the zoning
district in which such use is located or is proposed to be
located. The calculated sign area of each existing and proposed
sign shall be expressed as a percentage (1% to 100%) of the
maximum sign area permitted for that sign type in the zoning
district in which such use is located or proposed to be located.
The sum of the individual percentages computed for each
existing and proposed sign shall be defined as the total
(aggregated) sign area for such use.
(15) General provisions.
(a) Location.
[1] No sign shall hang or project over, or be placed upon, a
public right-of-way, except as set forth in § 60-410D(10)
herein.
[2] All signs on private property shall be located so as to not
interfere with the vision of a driver entering or leaving the
property on which they are located, or interfere with
visibility at an intersection or traffic light.
§ 60-410 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-410
1:272
[3] No sign shall be located on any exterior building wall so as
to project above the top of such wall at the location of the
sign or project beyond the ends of the wall to which it is
attached.
(b) Illumination. Where illumination of signage is permitted under
§ 60-410D(12) and (13) herein, such illumination shall comply
with the following requirements:
[1] Illumination shall be confined to, or directed to, the
surface of the sign.
[2] No flashing, rotating or intermittent illumination shall be
permitted.
[3] The sign, including its lighting sources, shall be designed
and shielded so that the light sources cannot be seen from
any neighboring residence district or from the street.
[4] Interior illumination of a sign shall not be permitted unless
such illumination is confined to the sign's lettering and/or
symbols, except that the illumination of the background
area of a sign with interior illumination may be permitted,
provided that the applicant can demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the approving authority that such lighting
will not result in a level of illumination or glare such that
the sign may cause a distraction to motorists or negatively
impact surrounding properties. Where interior
illumination of a sign's background materials is sought, the
applicant shall bear the burden of proof of demonstrating
compliance with the above standards.
[5] Illumination of signage regulated under § 60-410D(13)
herein shall be limited to not later than 10:00 p.m. or the
close of business for the establishment displaying the
illuminated signage, whichever is later.
(c) Design, construction and maintenance.
[1] All signs shall comply at all times with applicable
provisions of the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention
and Building Code and the electrical code of the Town of
New Castle.
[2] Except for window signs conforming in all respects with
the provisions of § 60-410D and sidewalk signs conforming
in all respects with the provisions of § 60-410D(13)(a)(f),
all signs shall be constructed of permanent materials and
shall be permanently attached to the ground, a building or
another structure by direct attachment to a rigid wall,
frame or structure. [Amended 7-13-2004 by L.L. No.
6-0004]
§ 60-410 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-410

[3] All signs shall be maintained in good structural condition
and free from all hazards, in compliance with all applicable
building and electrical codes and in conformance with all
applicable provisions of this chapter.
[4] All signs shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
attractive condition so as not to be detrimental to the
public health, safety and welfare.

within 180 days after the effective date of § 60-410D,
whichever date is sooner.
(c) Existing signs having a sign permit may be maintained and/or
repaired by repainting, identical replacement of lettering,
wording and accompanying symbols, reinforcement of the
structural supports or replacement of electrical wiring. Such
maintenance and/or repair shall not be considered a
modification requiring compliance with § 60-410D(17) herein.
Any modification to an existing sign that alters its appearance
or structural design, including but not limited to a change in
the dimensions, location, height or illumination, shall require
that all applicable permitting procedures of § 60-410D be
followed. As used herein, the term "modification" shall not
include a change in lettering, symbols, coloring or other design
features of an existing sign, provided that such change does
not alter any other characteristic of the sign's appearance or
its structural design.
(d) Any existing sign removed for purposes other than routine
maintenance and/or repair activities, as set forth in
§ 60-410D(16)(c) herein, after the effective date of § 60-410D
shall be deemed to be permanently removed and shall be
replaced only in accordance with all applicable provisions of
§ 60-410D.
(e) Any sign that concerns a use that is no longer in existence on
the property on which such sign is located shall be removed by
the property owner, or his authorized agent, within 30 days
after the use vacates the premises.

signage having a sign permit shall be permitted to remain;
provided, however, that any proposed signs shall be required
to comply with all applicable provisions of § 60-410D, including
but not limited to total (aggregated) sign area requirements.
(17) Approval required. [Amended 11-22-2011 by L.L. No. 15-2011]
(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, install, display, use,
alter, reconstruct, replace, move or relocate any sign for which
a sign permit is required in accordance with § 60-410D(12) and
(13) herein without having first obtained and paid for, and
having in force and effect, a sign permit therefor in accordance

(7) In acting on any site plan for such accessory uses, the Planning
Board may require such screening and limit the nature and hours of
operation to the extent which it determines necessary to
reasonably protect the rights of neighboring property owners and
to maintain the residential character of the area.
H. Multifamily districts. [Added 10-29-1979 by L.L. No. 16-1979]
(1) General purpose and intent. In order to provide suitable
opportunities within the Town for the development of housing
designed to satisfy the needs of smaller households, particularly
the young and the elderly, and of families of low/moderate income
and to encourage a broad array of housing types, dwelling unit
sizes and forms of ownership/occupancy, multifamily zoning
districts are hereby established. These districts are intended to
encourage the construction of multifamily housing on sites
§ 60-410 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-410
1:278
determined to be appropriate, based upon criteria established in
the Town Plan and in conformance with the standards
recommended therein, which standards are designed to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare, and to encourage
the development of housing which is responsive to the variety of
special size, design, locational and economic needs of present and
future residents of the Town and the region.
(2) Multifamily Residence District -- Chappaqua (MFR-C). It is the
specific purpose and intent of the MFR-C District to provide the
opportunity for and encourage the development of energy efficient
multifamily housing in and adjacent to the business center of
Chappaqua Hamlet on sites served by public sewer and water and
with the most convenient access to shopping, mass transportation,
major roads and other community facilities and services. It is the
Town's further objective that the MFR-C District provide both the
opportunity for and encourage the construction of housing at
relatively moderate prices. To help achieve these goals, the
following specific standards are set forth for this district:
(a) Density. The maximum permitted density within an MFR-C
District shall be determined based upon the lot area,
percentage of wetlands, waterbodies and watercourses as
defined in Chapter 137, Wetlands, or Chapter 64,
Environmental Protection Overlay Regulations, if the property
is located within an Environmental Protection Overlay District,
of the Code of the Town of New Castle, and the degree to which
the proposed development is designed to achieve the planning
and housing goals as set forth in this chapter and in the Town
Plan. [Amended 7-23-2002 by L.L. No. 5-2002]
[1] Basic permitted density.
[a] The basic multifamily density permitted by right in an
MFR-C District, subject only to site plan approval by
the Planning Board in accordance with § 60-440 of this
chapter, and subdivision plat approval, if appropriate,
shall be as follows:
Dwelling Unit Size
Minimum Gross Lot
Area Requirement Per
Dwelling Unit
(square feet)
Efficiency (studio)
apartment
2,200
1-bedroom apartment 3,300
2-bedroom apartment 4,400
3-bedroom apartment 5,500

Dwelling Unit Size
Minimum Gross Lot
Area Requirement Per
Dwelling Unit
(square feet)
4-bedroom apartment 6,600
1-family detached
dwelling [Amended
4-11-1990 by L.L. No.
21-1990]
6,600
[b] The determination of dwelling unit size for the
purpose of calculating the basic permitted density as
described above shall in each case be made by the
Planning Board, taking into consideration the floor
plans proposed by the applicant and such other
information as said Board may determine appropriate.
[c] The area of any wetlands, water bodies or
watercourses shall first be multiplied by a factor of
0.33 before being used in accordance with the
preceding gross lot-area formula to calculate the basic
permitted density on a proposed multifamily
development site. All actual construction, however,
shall be located on each site in accordance with the
requirements of Chapter 137, Watercourses, and in
consideration of the need to avoid or minimize adverse
environmental impacts in accordance with SEQR
requirements.
[2] Incentive density. Where an applicant for approval of a
multifamily development within an MFR-C District agrees
to provide certain special features, facilities and/or use
restrictions of the types listed below and where the
Planning Board determines that the provision of such will
serve to further the purpose and intent of this chapter and
of the Town Plan, the density within such development
may be increased up to 100% beyond the basic permitted
density or by so much thereof as determined appropriate
by the Planning Board based upon a consideration of the
number and combination of incentive features, facilities
and/or use restrictions proposed, the need for them at that
time, the nature and extent to which the applicant intends
to provide them, the appropriateness of the location of the
proposed site and the environmental suitability of the site
and the proposed development design to accommodate
such an increased density. In each such case the applicant
must obtain a special use permit from the Planning Board
pursuant to the relevant standards and requirements of
§ 60-430 of this chapter.
§ 60-410 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-410
1:280
[a] Nonwetlands areas. For that part of the basic
permitted density attributable to the nonwetlands
portion of any proposed multifamily development site,

following incentive criteria by the Planning Board, in
lieu of those criteria set forth for nonwetland areas in
§ 60-410H(2)(a)[2][a] above:
[i] The locational value of the wetland, water body or
watercourse for buffer screening, open space or
conservation purposes.
[ii] The importance of the environmental function(s)
served by the wetland, water body or watercourse
and the extent to which such function will be
preserved or enhanced as a part of the proposed
site development plan.
[iii] The site design and functional relationship
between the wetland, water body or watercourse
and the proposed multifamily development.
[3] Required model ordinance provisions affordable AFFH
unit component. Within all multifamily residential
developments of at least five but less than 10 units in a
MFR-C District, at least one of the units must be created as
a model ordinance provisions affordable AFFH unit, and
within all multifamily residential developments of 10 or
more units within an MFR-C District, no less than 10% of
the total number of units must be created as model
ordinance provisions affordable AFFH units. No
preferences shall be used to prioritize the selection of
income-eligible tenants or purchasers of any model
ordinance provisions affordable AFFH unit created under
this section. [Added 8-9-2011 by L.L. No. 10-2011]
(b) Traffic access. Properties within an MFR-C District shall have
either direct frontage on a major or collector road as shown on
the Town Plan or safe and convenient access to such a road
without passing through a one-family residence neighborhood.
(c) Utilities and services.
[1] Water and sewer service. MFR-C Districts are intended to
be established only on lands located within or adjacent to
public water and sewer districts. If land in an MFR-C
District is not presently within such utility district(s), the
establishment of the zoning district shall be contingent
upon the creation or expansion of such utility district(s) to
include the entire area of the lands so zoned. All dwelling
units constructed in the MFR-C District shall be connected
to public water and sewer systems in accordance with
standards approved by the Town Engineer, the
Westchester County Health Department and any other
§ 60-410 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-410
1:283
county, state or federal agencies having jurisdiction. All
dwelling units shall be separately metered for water.
[2] Drainage. Stormwater drainage systems serving any
multifamily development shall be designed so that the rate
of runoff from the site during a one-hundred-year storm
will not exceed that which would have occurred prior to its
construction. The calculation of such runoff rate and the
design of the drainage system shall be subject to the
approval of the Town Engineer. The Planning Board may,
based upon the recommendation of the Town Engineer,
waive or reduce this requirement where it is determined
that, due to the nature or location of the property within its
watershed, such a standard may be unnecessary or
inappropriate. [Amended 3-27-1984 by L.L. No.
2-198434]
[3] Refuse storage and collection. Plans for the storage and
collection of refuse within any multifamily development
shall be subject to Planning Board approval. The outside
storage of refuse, if permitted, shall be in rodentproof
containers conveniently located and enclosed or otherwise
screened from view. Such facilities shall comply with all
setback requirements applicable to principal buildings.
[4] Underground utilities. All utilities within any multifamily
development, including electric, telephone and cable
television service, shall be placed underground.
[5] Fire protection. All site plans for multifamily development
shall provide proper access for fire-fighting equipment and
personnel and shall provide hydrants in such number and
location and with such water pressure as may be
determined adequate and approved by the Planning
Board, based upon the recommendations of the Town
Engineer and the Fire Department having jurisdiction.
(d) Coverage. The maximum permitted building coverage within
an MFR-C District shall be 20%, and the maximum permitted
development coverage shall be 35%. Such coverage shall be
calculated on the basis of nonwetland areas, plus 33% of any
wetland areas on the site. Parking structures located wholly
underground shall be excluded for the purpose of these
calculations. [Amended 5-23-1995 by L.L. No. 6-1995]
(e) Off-street parking. Off-street parking shall be provided in
accordance with the standards and requirements of § 60-420F
of this chapter. In addition, the following special standards
shall apply in the MFR-C District:
34.Editor's Note: Said local law was readopted 7-31-1984.
§ 60-410 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-410
1:284
[1] At least 1/3 but no more than 90% of the minimum number
of required parking spaces shall be enclosed.
[2] No more than one of the minimum required parking spaces
for each dwelling unit may be designed or reserved
exclusively for the use of the occupants of that unit.
[3] At least 20% of the minimum number of required parking
spaces shall be designed and reserved for the use of
visitors and guests.
(f) Recreation and open space.
[1] (Reserved)35
[2] Private outdoor space. Each individual multifamily
dwelling unit shall, if practicable, be provided with a
private outdoor space in the form of a patio, terrace,
garden, courtyard, deck or balcony, which space shall be
immediately adjoining and directly accessible to the
dwelling unit which it serves.
[3] Other open spaces. All portions of any multifamily
development which are not used for one or more of the
purposes permitted above shall be designed and
maintained as permanent open space, either to be
landscaped or preserved in its natural state, all in
accordance with plans approved by the Planning Board.
(g) Other requirements.
[1] Individual unit access. In general, each individual dwelling
unit within any multifamily development shall have its own
separate entrance/exit leading directly to the outside. The
Planning Board may waive this requirement as a part of
site plan approval where said Board determines that the
basic intent of this requirement in terms of safety and the
avoidance of common hallway areas can be met through
other elements of the building design.
[2] Central antenna systems. If cable television service is not
available to serve a proposed multifamily development, a
central exterior radio/television antenna system or earth
station may be provided in accordance with plans
approved by the Planning Board. Exterior antennas for
individual multifamily buildings or dwelling units shall not
be otherwise permitted. [Amended 12-29-1982 by L.L.
No. 17-1982]

(3) Multifamily Residence District -- Millwood (MFR-M). It is the
specific purpose and intent of the MFR-M District to provide both
the opportunity and encouragement for the development of
moderately high-density, energy-efficient, multifamily housing in
and around the center of the Millwood Hamlet on sites served by
public or community sewer and water systems and with convenient
access to shopping and major roads. It is the Town's further
objective that the MFR-M District provide both the opportunity for
and encourage the construction of housing at relatively moderate
prices. To help achieve these goals, the standards for this District
shall be the same as those set forth in Subsection H(2) above for
the MFR-C District, except as modified below:
(a) Density. The permitted basic and incentive densities within an
MFR-M District shall be calculated as in the MFR-C District,
except that they shall be based upon the following minimum lot
area standards:
Dwelling Unit Size
Minimum Gross Lot Area
Requirement Per Dwelling
Unit
(square feet)
Efficiency (studio)

(4) Multifamily Planned Development District (MFPD). It is the specific
purpose and intent of the MFPD District to provide the opportunity
within the Town of New Castle for the development on a planned
basis of medium-density multifamily housing on sites located in
existing single-family residential neighborhoods but in reasonable
proximity to shopping services and other community facilities and
with access to major roads. To help assure the achievement of this
goal with proper protection for existing neighboring development,
all future MFPD Districts which have not already been designated
on the Town Zoning Map shall be established on a floating.zone
basis, subject to approval by the Town Board in each case, and in
accordance with an approved preliminary development concept

the detailed design of the proposed development in
accordance with such concept plan and the
subsequent procedures and requirements of this
section. A copy of the resolution containing the Town
Board's decision shall be forwarded to the Planning
Board and to the applicant. A copy shall also be placed
on file in the office of the Town Clerk and, if in the
form of an approval, the official copy of the Town
Zoning Map shall be amended accordingly.
[b] Approval of the establishment of an MFPD District
which was not designated on the Town Zoning Map
prior to January 1, 1980, shall expire within 12 months
of the date of Town Board approval if the applicant has
not applied for and received site development plan
approval and final subdivision approval, if
appropriate, for at least the first section of the
planned development from the Planning Board in
accordance with the subsequent requirements of this
chapter and unless work on the site is begun within 18

development plan approved by the Planning Board in
accordance with this section and with the procedures
and standards for site development plan approval as
set forth in § 60-440 of this chapter.
[b] Where a proposed multifamily development also
involves the construction of a new street or any
§ 60-410 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-410
1:290
subdivision or resubdivision of land, no development
may proceed until the Planning Board has also
granted final subdivision approval in accordance with
the standards and procedures of the Land Subdivision
Regulations, Chapter 113 of this Code.
(b) Development standards. Development within MFPD Districts
shall be governed by the same standards as those set forth in
Subsection H(2) above for MFR-C Districts, except as modified
below:
[1] Location. The establishment of MFPD Districts shall be
permitted only within R-1/4A, R-1/2A, R-1A and
nonresidential districts and only when the location is
within 1/2 mile of the boundary of a business district.
[2] Minimum site size. The minimum site size required for the
establishment of an MFPD District shall be five acres, but,
in any case, the site shall be of such shape, dimension,
topography and location as will allow for an appropriate
and attractive development with proper setbacks,
screening and a harmonious relationship with adjoining
land uses and the natural physical terrain.
[3] Ownership. A proposed MFPD District site may be owned
by one or more persons or corporations but shall be
presented as a single parcel of land at the time application
for rezoning is made. The application shall be jointly filed
by all owners and, if approved, shall be jointly binding on
them. If required by the Planning Board, this shall be
confirmed by written agreement, in recordable form
satisfactory to the Town Attorney.
[4] Density. The permitted basic and incentive densities within
an MFPD District shall be calculated as in the MFR-C
District, except that they shall be based upon the following
minimum lot area standards:
Dwelling Unit Size
Minimum Gross Lot Area
Requirement Per Dwelling
Unit
(square feet)
Efficiency (studio)
apartment
4,400
1-bedroom apartment 6,600
2-bedroom apartment 8,800

13,200
The granting of any incentive density increase within an
MFPD District and the amount of such increase shall be
determined by the agency responsible for the approval of
the preliminary development concept plan.
[5] Coverage. The maximum permitted building coverage
within an MFPD District shall be 15%, and the maximum
permitted development coverage shall be 30%. Such
coverage shall be calculated on the basis of nonwetland
areas, plus 33% of any wetland areas on the site. Parking
structures located wholly underground shall be excluded
for the purpose of these calculations. [Amended
5-23-1995 by L.L. No. 6-1995]
(5) Accessory apartments in one-family residence districts. It is the
specific purpose and intent of allowing accessory apartments on
one-family properties in all one-family residence districts to provide
the opportunity and encouragement for the development of small,
rental housing units designed, in particular, to meet the special
housing needs of single persons and couples of low and moderate
income, both young and old, and of relatives of families presently
living in New Castle. Furthermore, it is the purpose and intent of
this provision to allow the more efficient use of the Town's existing
stock of dwellings and accessory buildings, to provide economic
support for present resident families of limited income and to
protect and preserve property values. To help achieve these goals
and to promote the other objectives of this chapter and of the Town
Development Plan, the following specific standards are set forth for
such accessory apartment uses: [Amended 7-7-1981 by L.L. No.
6-1981; 3-9-1982 by L.L. No. 3-1982; 6-9-1987 by L.L. No.
5-1987; 5-22-1990 by L.L. No. 26-1990; 6-25-1991 by L.L. No.
13-1991; 10-8-2002 by L.L. No. 10-200238]
(a) Owner occupancy required. An owner of the one-family lot
upon which the accessory apartment is located shall occupy at
least one of the dwelling units on the premises as a principal
residence.
38.Editor's Note: This local law also stated that it superseded any inconsistent provisions of
Town Law §§ 267 and 267-b.
§ 60-410 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-410
1:292
(b) Location on the lot. An accessory apartment may be located
either in the principal dwelling building or in an accessory
building, provided that such principal dwelling building or
accessory building conforms to the other requirements of this
chapter, unless a variance therefor shall have been granted by
the Zoning Board of Appeals. An accessory apartment shall not
be located in space originally designed to be used for the
indoor storage of vehicles, unless such space is in excess of
that which is needed to satisfy the minimum off-street parking
requirement for the existing principal use on the subject
property or unless an alternative location for such parking
satisfactory to the Planning Board is provided. Such alternative
location may include but shall not be limited to newly
constructed garage space or an outdoor parking area that is
adequately buffered to visually screen its location from
adjacent streets and residences on abutting lots.
(c) Apartment size. The floor area for an accessory apartment
within a principal dwelling building shall be at least 300 square
feet, but in no case shall it exceed the lesser of 1,000 square
feet or 30% of the total area of the dwelling building in which it
is located, unless, in the opinion of the Planning Board, a
greater or lesser amount of floor area is warranted by the
characteristics of the particular building, which may include
but not be limited to consideration of its existing floor plan and
structural characteristics. The floor area for an accessory
apartment located in an accessory building shall be at least
300 square feet, but in no case shall it exceed 1,000 square
feet. There shall be no more than two bedrooms in any
accessory apartment.
[1] Requirements for construction, alteration or enlargement:
[Amended 1-8-2019 by L.L. No. 1-2019]
[a] A principal dwelling building may be altered, enlarged
or constructed to accommodate an accessory
apartment, provided that such alteration, enlargement
or construction conforms to the other requirements of
this chapter, unless a variance therefor shall be
granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
[b] An accessory building may be altered, enlarged or
constructed to accommodate an accessory apartment,
provided that such alteration, enlargement or
construction conforms to the other requirements of
this chapter, unless a variance therefor shall be
granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals and, if such
alteration or enlargement is of an existing accessory
building, the Planning Board finds that such alteration
or enlargement is warranted by the characteristics of
the particular building, which may include but not be
§ 60-410 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-410
1:293
limited to consideration of desirable functional and
aesthetic modifications, and will not produce a result
that is inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter.
(d) Number of accessory apartments per lot. There shall be no
more than one accessory apartment permitted on a one-family
building lot.
(e) Exterior appearance. If an accessory apartment is located in
the principal dwelling building, the entry to such unit and its
design shall be such that, to the degree reasonably feasible,
the appearance of the building will remain as a one-family
residence.
(f) Water and sewer service. Prior to the issuance of a building
permit for the establishment of an accessory apartment in a
principal dwelling building or the conversion of a portion of an
existing accessory building to an accessory apartment use or
construction of an accessory building to accommodate an
accessory apartment, approval of the proposed method of
water supply and sewage disposal shall be obtained from the
Westchester County Department of Health and shall be further
subject to approval by the Town Engineer. Wherever
determined reasonably feasible by the Town Engineer,

at the site where any small wireless facility is located, upon notice
to the wireless telecommunications provider.
(16) Proof of insurance. The applicant and the owner of the property
where the small wireless facility is to be located, if different, shall
provide the Planning Board with proof of insurance in a sufficient
dollar amount in the reasonable, judgment of the Planning Board to
cover potential personal and property damage associated with
construction and operation of such facility.
(17) Revocation of small wireless facility permit.
(a) If a small wireless facility is constructed, repaired, rebuilt,
placed, moved, relocated, modified or maintained in a way that
is inconsistent or not in compliance with the provisions of this
subsection or of the small wireless facility permit conditions
and requirements, or it is determined conclusively that the
applicant made materially false or misleading statements
during the application process, then the Planning Board or the
Building Inspector, or their designee, shall notify the holder of
the small wireless facility permit in writing of such violation.
Such notice shall specify the nature of the violation or
noncompliance, and the violations must be corrected within
seven days of the date of the postmark of the notice, or of the
date of personal service of the notice, whichever is earlier.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection or
any other provision of this subsection, if the violation or
noncompliance causes, creates or presents an imminent
danger or threat to the health or safety of lives or property, the
Planning Board or Building Inspector may, at their sole
discretion, order the violation remedied within 24 hours.
(b) If the small wireless facility is not brought into compliance with

small wireless facility into compliance, then the Planning
Board or the Building Inspector may revoke such small
wireless facility permit and require removal of such small
wireless facility.
(18) Removal.
(a) Under the following circumstances, the Town may determine
that the safety, public welfare, character and environment of
the Town warrant and require the removal of small wireless
facilities, under the following circumstances:
[1] The small wireless facility has been abandoned (i.e., not
used as wireless telecommunications facilities) for a
period exceeding 90 consecutive days or a total of 180
days in any 365-day period, except for periods caused by
force majeure or acts of God, in which case repair or
removal shall commence within 90 days;
[2] A permitted small wireless facility falls into such a state of
disrepair that it creates a safety hazard;
[3] The small wireless facility has been located, constructed,
or modified without first obtaining, or in a manner not
authorized by, the required small wireless facility permit,
or any other necessary authorization; or
[4] Any small wireless facility is determined to be in violation
of this subsection and fails to cure such violation within
the time set forth herein.
(b) If the Planning Board makes a determination pursuant to
§ 60-410O(18)(a), then it shall notify the holder of the small
facility permit and the owner of the property in writing that
said small wireless facility is to be removed.
(c) The holder of the small wireless facility permit or the owner of
the property shall be required to dismantle and remove such
small wireless facilities, and all accessory equipment and
associated structures, from the site and return the site to its
original condition and certify through soils or other testing that
no contamination has been created by the facility, such
restoration being completed, limited only by physical or
commercial impracticability, within 90 days of receipt of
written notice from the Town to remove such small wireless
facilities. However, if the owner of the property upon which the
small wireless facility is located wishes to retain any access
roadway to the small wireless facilities, the owner may do so
with the approval of the Town.
§ 60-410 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-410
1:324
§ 60-420. General regulations.
(d) If the small wireless facility is not removed or substantial
progress has not been made to remove the small wireless
facility within 90 days after the small facility permit holder has
received such written notice of removal, then the Planning
Board may order officials or representatives of the Town to
remove the small wireless facility at the sole expense of the
property owner and/small wireless facility permit holder.
(e) If the Town removes or causes to be removed the small
wireless facilities, and the owner of the wireless
telecommunications facility does not claim and remove them to
a lawful location within 10 days, then the Town may take steps
to declare the small wireless facility abandoned and dispose of
or sell them and their components and retain the proceeds
therefrom. The Town may also cause the costs associated with
the removal and disposal of the small wireless facilities to be
assessed on the property in the same manner as a tax or
assessment.
(19) Performance security. The applicant and the owner of record of any
proposed wireless telecommunication services facility, at their cost
and expense, shall be jointly required to execute and file with the
Town a bond, or other form of security acceptable to the Town as to
type of security and the form and manner of execution, in an
amount to be determined by the Town Engineer, based on actual
estimates supplied by the applicant, ensuring removal of the facility
upon expiration or termination of the small wireless facility permit
or cessation of facility; and with such sureties as are deemed
sufficient by the Planning Board to assure the faithful performance
of the terms and conditions of this subsection and conditions of any
small wireless facility permit issued pursuant to this section. The
full amount of the bond or security shall remain in full force and
effect throughout the term of the small wireless facility permit and/
or until any necessary site restoration is completed to restore the
site to a condition comparable to that which existed prior to the
issuance of the small wireless facility permit. Upon written
application by the applicant, the Town may, at its sole option,
permit the amount of the bond to be reduced or waive the bond
requirement.
A. Lots.
(1) Lots for every building. Every building hereafter erected shall be
located on a lot as herein defined.
(2) Required street frontage and lot width. [Amended 6-12-1984 by
L.L. No. 5-1984; 10-9-1990 by L.L. No. 36-1990]
§ 60-410 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-420
1:325
(a) No permit shall be issued for any land use or structure unless
the lot upon which such land use is to be established or
structure is to be built has the required frontage and access on
a street or highway as specified in this chapter. As used herein,
frontage shall be measured along an unbroken line formed by a
single street line or the continuation of intersecting street
lines.
(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary
and except with respect to the application of § 281 of the Town
Law,41 the subdivision of property into lots having no street
frontage and for which access to a street is derived by way of
an easement shall be prohibited. Relief from this provision may
be granted only upon application to and after hearing on due
notice to the parties by the Zoning Board of Appeals upon a
showing of unnecessary hardship as required in connection
with the granting of a use variance.
(c) No part of any lot which lies between the front lot line and the
principal building shall be narrower in lot width than the street
frontage for such lot, unless such frontage is greater than the
required minimum lot width, in which case that part of the lot
which lies between the front lot line and the principal building
shall be at least as wide as the required minimum lot width. For
all lots created after the effective date of this provision, a
principal building shall not be permitted on any portion of a lot
which does not meet the required minimum lot width.
(3) Subdivision of a lot. Where a lot is formed hereafter from part of a
lot already occupied by a building, such separation shall be effected
in such manner as to conform to all of the requirements of this
chapter with respect to the existing building and building coverage,
floor area ratio, development coverage and all yards and other
required spaces in connection therewith, and no permit shall be
issued for the establishment of a land use or the erection of a
building on the new lot thus created, unless it complies with all the
provisions of this chapter and Chapter 48 of the Code of the Town
of New Castle. [Amended 5-23-1995 by L.L. No. 6-1995;
11-22-2011 by L.L. No. 15-2011]
(4) New buildings on substandard lots (lots having less than the
minimum area). A permit may be issued for the erection of a
building for a permitted use on a lot for which a valid conveyance
has been recorded prior to the adoption of any zoning ordinance or
amendment making said lot nonconforming in area,
notwithstanding that the area of such lot is less than that required
for the district in which such lot lies, provided that: [Amended
8-22-1978 by L.L. No. 5-1978; 4-28-1992 by L.L. No. 7-1992;
1-24-1995 by L.L. No. 1-1995]

(a) The lot met the zoning requirements at the time the deed to the
lot was recorded.
(b) All yard setbacks and other building related requirements
which are in effect at the time of the obtaining of the building
permit are complied with.
(c) The ownership of such lot was not the same as other lots
contiguous thereto at any time on or after the adoption of a
zoning ordinance or amendment making such lot
nonconforming in area. If the lot was not in separate
ownership, such other lot, or so much thereof as may be
necessary, shall be combined with the first-named lot to make
one or more conforming lots, whereupon a permit may be
issued, but only for such combined lots.
(5) Parts of a lot not counted toward area requirements. For any lot
created by a subdivision subsequent to the date of adoption of this
chapter, no part of such lot which is less in width than 1/2 the
minimum requirement for the district in which it is located shall be
counted as part of the required minimum lot area.
(6) Lots under water or subject to flooding. No more than 10% of the
minimum area requirement of a lot may be fulfilled by land which is
under water, subject to flooding, classified as a floodway under
Chapter 70, Flood Damage Prevention, of the Code of the Town of
New Castle or classified as a wetland under Chapter 137,
Watercourses, of the Code of the Town of New Castle. [Amended

upon which that improvement has been constructed, shall be
applied in its entirety to the computation of the maximum
permitted building coverage and/or maximum permitted
development coverage of the lot which benefits from the
improvement. The square footage of any such improvement
which benefits both the lot upon which it has been constructed
and another lot or lots shall be applied to the computation of

required for principal buildings. [Amended 5-23-1995 by L.L.
No. 6-1995]
(2) Rear dwellings. No building located to the rear of another building
shall be used as a dwelling unless there shall be a suitable open
space at least 15 feet wide from the street to said rear building for
direct access of fire-fighting equipment.
(3) Prohibited use characteristics. No use shall be permitted or
allowed to exist if it is determined by the Building Inspector that
such use causes or results in:
(a) Dissemination of undue noise, vibration, excessive light, dust,
smoke, gas, fumes, odor or other measurable atmospheric
pollutant or harmful discharge of waste materials beyond the
boundaries of the site on which the use is located.
(b) Interference with radio or television reception beyond the lot
upon which the building is located in which such use is
conducted, or scientific testing of instruments which require
the flying of aircraft in the vicinity in such manner as to
constitute a public nuisance.
(c) Menace by reason of fire, explosion or other physical hazard.
(d) Undue traffic hazards or congestion due to the type or number
of vehicles associated with such use.
§ 60-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-420

(e) Dangerous radioactivity at any point beyond the boundaries of
the site on which the use is located. (The handling of
radioactive materials, the discharge of such materials into air
and water and the disposal of radioactive wastes shall be in
conformance with the regulations of the Atomic Energy
Commission as set forth in Title 10, Chapter 1, Part 20 --
Standards for Protection Against Radiation, as amended, and
all applicable regulations of the State of New York.)
C. Yards and building projections.
(1) Yard and open space for every building. No yard or other open
space provided about any building for the purpose of complying
with the provisions of these regulations shall be included as any
part of the yard or open space for any other building. No yard or
other open space on one lot shall be considered as a yard or open
space for a building on any other lot. No principal business use may
be conducted within any required yard area. No accessory
buildings, decks, porches or terraces may be located within any
required yard. On all lots, a yard equal to the required front yard
shall be provided with respect to any side lot line at an angle of 45°
or less to the street and located between the street and a principal
building contained thereon if such line is wholly or partially in front
of said building, as well as with respect to any side lot line that is
generally opposite the front facade of the principal building located
on said lot. On all lots, a yard equal to the required rear yard shall
be provided with respect to any side lot line at an angle of 45° or
less to the street if such line is wholly or partially behind the
principal building, as well as with respect to any side lot line that is
generally opposite the rear facade of the principal building
contained on said lot. [Amended 10-9-1990 by L.L. No.

(2) Projections into yards. The space in any required yard shall be open
and unobstructed, except for the ordinary projection of the
windowsills, bay windows, belt courses, chimneys, cornices, eaves
and other architectural features, provided that such architectural
features shall not project more than three feet into any required
yard and shall not in the aggregate occupy more than 1/4 of the
length of the wall on which they are located. [Amended
5-23-1995 by L.L. No. 6-1995]
(3) Projections above the roof level. Chimneys antennas, towers,
gables, elevator enclosures, church spires, cupolas, water tanks,
solar energy collectors, similar structures and necessary
mechanical appurtenances may be erected on a building to a height
greater than the limit established for the district in which the
building is located, provided that they are not used for sleeping or
housekeeping purposes or for any purposes other than such as may
be incident to the permitted use of the principal building. However,
such structures and appurtenances shall be erected only to a
§ 60-420 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-420
1:332
height necessary to accomplish the purpose they are intended to
serve, and except for solar energy collectors, they shall not cover
at any level more than 10% of the area of the section of the roof
on which they are located. Except for antenna structures expressly
permitted in § 60-410A, any such structure or appurtenance
proposed to be erected to a height exceeding the maximum
permitted building height in the district in which it is located
shall not be granted a building permit until such structure shall
have been approved as to height and design by the Board of
Architectural Review. Such structures and appurtenances shall be
enclosed with materials of a type and design that will be in
harmony with the materials and design of the building on which
they are located. In the B-RO-150 District, no projection above
the roof level shall exceed seven feet above the maximum building
height allowed in said district except where, in addition to
complying with above standards and requirements, including
Board of Architectural Review approval, specific approval for such
additional height shall have been granted by the Planning Board.

(4) Corner lots, double-frontage lots and lots deriving access to a
street by way of an easement. A yard equal to the required front
yard shall be provided with respect to any lot line that abuts a
street. [Amended 2-11-1985 by L.L. No. 3-1985; 10-9-1990 by
L.L. No. 36-1990]
(5) Walls and fences. [Amended 2-27-1990 by L.L. No. 3-1990;
5-23-1995 by L.L. No. 6-1995; 1-27-1998 by L.L. No. 2-1998]
(a) Walls. Regardless of the location of a freestanding wall on a lot,
parcel or property, such wall shall not exceed six feet in height
and shall not conflict with the standards in § 60-420C(6).
(b) Fences. Subject to the standards set forth in § 60-420C(6), (a)
fences located at the property line or within a required
minimum yard setback shall not exceed six feet in height; (b)
fences which are not located within required minimum yard
setbacks shall be subject to the following height limitations: (I)
solid fences (as defined below) shall not exceed six feet in
height; (II) open fences (as defined below) shall not exceed
eight feet in height; and (III) open mesh fences (as defined
below) shall not exceed eight feet in height. In addition, fences
shall be erected with the finished side facing the street and the
finished side facing the abutting property wherever the
finished side of the fence may be visible. A "solid fence" is
defined as a fence made of materials or construction with more
than 1/4 solid material when viewed from a position which is at
a right angle to the fence. An "open fence" is defined as a fence
made of materials or construction with 1/4 or less solid
material when viewed from a position which is at a right angle
§ 60-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-420
1:333
to the fence. An "open mesh fence" is defined as an open fence
constructed of a black, plastic or metallic threaded network
or grid commonly used to protect gardens and shrubber from
deer and other large animals. If there is any inconsistency
between the provisions of this section and the provisions of
the requirements of § 720.1(g) of the State Uniform Fire
Prevention and Building Code ("State Code") with regard to
fencing of a swimming pool, then the provisions of the State
Code shall control. [Amended 7-27-1999 by L.L. No.
13-1999]
(6) Visibility at intersections.
(a) On any corner lot, no building, fence, sign, wall, hedge or other
structure or planting, except an open-mesh wire fence, shall be
erected, placed or maintained in such a way as to interfere
with clear sight distance within the triangular area formed by
the two intersecting street right-of-way lines and a straight line
connecting points along said lines, which points are located 50
feet back from the theoretical point of intersection of such
lines extended. Such required sight distance shall assume the
observer's eye to be 31/2 feet above the street surface at the
nearest edge of pavement and the object one foot above the
nearest edge of pavement on the intersecting street. This
paragraph shall not apply to existing trees, provided that no
branches less than six feet in height above the ground are
blocking such clear sight distance.
(b) Conditions on corner lots within the Town that impair the clear
sight distance of vehicles entering into intersections constitute
a public nuisance and are dangerous to the public health,
safety and welfare. Where a property owner fails to correct
such nuisance, it is imperative that the Town have the
authority to correct such a condition. Pursuant to the
Municipal Home Rule Law, the Town hereby enacts this
subsection to provide for a property owner to reimburse the
Town for any expense incurred in connection with correcting a
public nuisance. [Added 12-22-1992 by L.L. No. 19-1992]
(c) In the event that a condition exists on a corner lot, subject to
the above, which interferes with or obstructs clear sight
distance, as described herein, the Town shall provide the
owner of such lot with a notice, which shall be delivered by
regular mail at the address shown on the last assessment roll
of the Town, advising said owner of the existence of a violation
of this provision and that said violation must be cured within
30 days of the date of such notice. If at the end of such thirtyday
period, such condition is not cured, then the Town is
hereby authorized to enter upon said lot and to correct such
condition. The owner of said lot shall be responsible for all
costs incurred by the Town in connection with its correcting
§ 60-420 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-420
1:334
said condition. The Town shall provide the owner of said lot
with an invoice representing the cost to the Town for
correcting the condition. The owner shall be responsible for
remitting payment in full to the Town within 30 days of the
date of such invoice. Failure of the owner to remit payment in
full pursuant to such invoice shall result in the amount owed
being a lien upon the property and placed upon the next Town
tax bill as an additional tax lien and collected in the same
manner as other Town taxes. The rights, remedies, penalties
and provisions, as provided hereunder, shall be in addition to
those provided elsewhere in this chapter, including § 60-530
hereof. [Added 12-22-1992 by L.L. No. 19-1992]
(7) Courts. The least horizontal dimension of any court, at any level,
shall not be less than the height of any vertical wall forming part of
such court above the sill of the lowest window served by such
court, but not less than 20 feet in any case.
(8) Swimming pools.
(a) A swimming pool shall be set back from lot lines at least the
minimum distance required for a principal building in the
district in which it is located, except that such facility shall not
be located in a front yard unless it is set back at least three
times the distance required for a principal building and the lot
has an area equal to at least three times the minimum
requirement for the district in which it is located. The
minimum required setbacks established for swimming pools
shall also apply to cabanas and decks or terraces surrounding
the pool, as well as to all structures and mechanical equipment
or other appurtenances related to their use and operation.
[Amended 7-26-1988 by L.L. No. 11-88; 5-23-1995 by L.L.
No. 6-1995]
(b) Swimming pool enclosures shall comply with the New York
State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code, as the same
may be amended from time to time. [Amended 3-8-1988 by
L.L. No. 2-198842]
(9) Tennis and platform tennis courts. [Added 4-26-1977 by L.L. No.
5-1977]
(a) The construction and use of a tennis court or platform tennis
court shall be permitted only where such facility is clearly
incidental and accessory to a permitted principal use on the
same premises therewith and only when it is limited to the
personal use and enjoyment to the residents of the premises
and their guests and is not operated for profit.
42.Editor's Note: This local law also repealed former §§ 60-423.83 and 60-433.84, which dealt
with pool enclosures.
§ 60-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-420
1:335
(b) A tennis court or platform tennis court and appurtenant
enclosure shall be set back from all lot lines at least the
minimum distance required for a principal building in the
district in which it is located, except that such facility shall not
be located in a front yard unless set back at least three times
the distance required for a principal building and the lot has an
area equal to at least three times the minimum requirements
for the district in which it is located. [Amended 5-23-1995 by
L.L. No. 6-1995]
(c) A tennis court or platform tennis court shall not be lighted for
night play, except by special permit issued by the Zoning Board
of Appeals, upon a determination that such lighting will have
no adverse impact upon, or interfere with, the use and
enjoyment of neighboring residential properties. The Board
shall attach such conditions and safeguards to any special use
permit, which are, in its opinion, necessary to ensure initial
and continual conformity with this requirement. In all cases,
the Board shall retain continuing jurisdiction.
(d) Drainage facilities, subject to the approval of the Town
Engineer, shall be provided as necessary to prevent any
increase in the quantity of off-site runoff or in its surface
channelization as a result of the construction of such tennis
court or platform tennis court.
(e) Where determined necessary or appropriate by the Building
Inspector, a buffer screening area complying with the
requirements of § 60-420D(2) of this chapter may be required.
(10) Exception for existing alignment of buildings. In any district if, on
the same side of a street, there is a pronounced uniformity of
alignment of the fronts of existing buildings and of the depths of
front yards less than the requirements specified in the Schedule of
District Regulations,43 said proposed building need not be set back
from the street line a distance greater than the average setback of
such existing buildings, except that such reduced setbacks in
business and industrial districts shall be permitted only where
approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals as being in accordance
with the spirit and intent of this chapter. [Amended 5-23-1995 by
L.L. No. 6-1995]
D. Miscellaneous regulations.
(1) Exterior lighting. [Amended 10-23-1990 by L.L. No. 38-1990]
(a) To the extent reasonably practicable, all exterior lighting used
for nonresidential purposes, including the lighting of signs,
shall be directed away from adjoining residential properties
and streets.
43.Editor's Note: Said Schedule is located at the end of this chapter.
§ 60-420 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-420
1:336
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person owning, using or occupying
property that is subject to this chapter to use or permit the use
of exterior lighting upon such property in a manner which
unreasonably interferes with the use or enjoyment of
neighboring residential property or creates a public safety
hazard or nuisance.
(2) Buffer screening areas. Any application for the erection,
construction, enlargement, alteration or movement of any building
or structure or for the establishment of any use within any business
or industrial district or any nonresidential use in any residence
district shall include provisions for a buffer screening area at least
10 feet in width along any lot line abutting or, if determined
necessary by the approving authority, directly across the street
from any lot in a residence district. This requirement may be
waived by the approving authority in situations where it
determines that large distances, topographic features or existing
vegetation satisfy the same purpose. Where such a buffer screening
area is required, it shall meet the following standards:
(a) Be of evergreen planting of such type, height, spacing and
arrangement as, in the judgment of the approving authority,
will screen the activity involved from the neighboring
residential area. Nonevergreen planting may seasonally
supplement evergreen planting but not take its place.
(b) The plan and specifications for such planting shall be filed with
the plans for the use of the lot.
(c) Required planting shall be properly trimmed and maintained in
good condition at all times.
(d) A wall or fence, of location, height, design and materials
approved by the approving authority as providing equivalent
screening, may be substituted for part or all of the required
planting.
(3) General property maintenance. Every owner or tenant of any
property used for commercial purposes shall maintain the premises
free of litter, garbage, refuse and rubbish of every kind, as such
materials are defined in Chapter 85, Littering, of the New Castle
Town Code. [Amended 10-8-1991 by L.L. No. 19-1991]
(4) (Reserved)44
(5) Solar access and energy considerations. Access to sunlight for
present and potential solar energy systems, both on- and off-site, as
well as building siting, orientation and landscaping shall be

considered by approving authorities as part of their review of any
application. [Added 9-14-1982 by L.L. No. 11-1982]
(6) Transition between residential and nonresidential districts.
[Added 10-25-1983 by L.L. No. 10-1983]
(a) Recognizing that the potential for conflict between
incompatible land uses is greatest at the border between
residential and nonresidential districts, and for the purpose of
protecting the health, safety, welfare and property values of
persons and properties in such areas by assuring a more
orderly transition between commercial and residential
neighborhoods,including the possible limitation of potentially
undesirable uses in such locations, it is hereby declared to be
the policy of the Town of New Castle to establish transition
areas at the perimeter of all business and industrial districts.
This is in addition and supplementary to the requirement for
the provision of landscaped buffer screening in such areas, as
required by § 60-420D(2) above.
(b) Within such transition areas, the reviewing agency, whether it
is the Planning Board or the Zoning Board of Appeals, is hereby
granted the authority necessary to accomplish the purposes of
this section within the limitations as set forth below. This
additional authority shall apply only to lots within business and
industrial districts, any portion of which is situated within 100
feet of any portion of a lot in a residence district.
Implementation of this authority shall be accomplished as part
of the site plan or special permit review process, as
appropriate to the particular application involved.
(c) On lots within the defined transition area, the Planning Board
or the Zoning Board of Appeals, as appropriate, may require
limitations on the types of uses permitted, the type, intensity
and location of exterior lighting, the storage of refuse, the
loading and unloading of trucks, the location of signs and other
similar factors to the extent determined necessary by said
Board to accomplish the purposes of transition zoning as set
forth herein. These limitations may include, but are not limited
to, the authority to prohibit certain special permit uses entirely
within such transition areas if it is determined by the reviewing
agency that the potentially adverse impacts of such uses
cannot be sufficiently mitigated by other means.
E. Nonconforming uses and other nonconformities.
(1) Continuing existing uses. Except as otherwise provided herein
[particularly in § 60-420E(6) and (7)], the lawfully permitted use of
land or structures existing at the time of the adoption of this
chapter may be continued although such use does not conform to
§ 60-420 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-420
1:338
the standards specified for the zone in which such land or structure
is located. Said uses shall be deemed legal nonconforming uses.
(2) Legal nonconforming use of land. Where no structure is involved,
the legal nonconforming use of land may be continued, provided,
however:
(a) That no such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or
increased, nor shall it be extended to occupy a greater area of
land than that occupied by such use at the time of the adoption
of this chapter.
(b) That no such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in
part to any other portion of the lot or parcel of land occupied
by such nonconforming use at the time of the adoption of this
chapter.
(c) That if such nonconforming use or any portion thereof ceases
for any reason for any continuous period of more than 90 days,
or is changed to a conforming use, any future use shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter for the district in
which such use is located.
(d) That no nonconforming use of land shall be changed to another
nonconforming use.
(3) Legal nonconforming use of structures.
(a) A structure, the use of which does not conform to the use
regulations for the district in which it is situated shall not be
altered, enlarged or extended unless the use thereof is
changed to a conforming use, except that the Board of Appeals,
after public notice and hearing, may permit a legal
nonconforming use to be extended throughout those parts of a
structure which were manifestly arranged or designed for such
use prior to the time of the enactment of the chapter provision
that made the use nonconforming, if no structural alterations
other than those required for health or safety are made
therein.
(b) Such nonconforming use of a structure shall not be changed to
another nonconforming use, except where approved by the
Board of Appeals after a finding that the change will be to a
substantially less nonconforming use and one that will be more
harmonious with the surrounding area.
(c) If any legal nonconforming use of a structure ceases for any
reason for a continuous period of more than six months, or is
changed to a conforming use, or if the structure in or on which
such use is conducted or maintained is moved for any distance
whatever, for any reason, then any future use of such structure
§ 60-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-420
1:339
shall be in conformity with the standards specified by this
chapter for the district in which such structure is located.
(d) If any structure in which any such nonconforming use is
conducted or maintained is hereafter removed, the subsequent
use of the land on which such structure was located and the
subsequent use of any structure thereon shall be in conformity
with the standards specified by this chapter for the district in
which such land or structure is located.
(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 60-420E(2) and (3), an owner
of any land, building or structure containing a nonconforming use
may apply to the Planning Board for site development plan
approval which includes proposed changes and modifications to the
nonconforming use in order that the nonconforming use may be
brought into greater conformity with this chapter and that the
adverse external impacts of such use may be reduced. Such
application shall include a site development plan indicating the
proposed changes in the nonconforming building, structure or use
as well as proposals for related improvements in landscaping,
buffer areas, the location and layout of parking areas and access
drives, aesthetics, reduction of noise, smoke, odors and the
discharge of effluents, changes in lighting, signage, buildings and
drainage and other such similar modifications and improvements.
Following a public hearing, as may be otherwise required for site
development plan approval, the Planning Board may approve or
modify and approve the application, provided that it is determined
that the purposes of this section will be met. In the absence of such
determination by the Planning Board, the application shall be
disapproved. [Added 10-25-1983 by L.L. No. 9-1983]
(5) Legal nonconformity, other than use. [Amended 6-27-1989 by
L.L. No. 12-1989; 5-23-1995 by L.L. No. 6-1995]
(a) A nonconforming building or structure may not be added to,
extended or enlarged to result in an increase or expansion of a
nonconformity, other than use, without a variance from the
Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with § 60-540D(2) of
this chapter. An increase or expansion of a nonconformity,
other than use, shall include but not be limited to an extension
of a structure that is nonconforming as to the required yard
along the same line that established the nonconforming yard
and that maintains the same legal nonconforming distance
from the property line as existed for the original portion of the
building.
(b) A nonconforming structure may be altered in whole or in part
in a way that diminishes the extent of its nonconformity, other
than use, without first receiving approval from the Zoning
Board of Appeals as required in the previous subsection;
provided, however, that once a nonconforming structure is
§ 60-420 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-420
1:340
made less nonconforming, it shall not be permitted to return to
any extent or degree of its previous nonconformity, other than
use.
(c) A nonconforming building or structure shall not be moved in
whole or in part unless such building or structure is made to
conform to all of the regulations of the district in which it is to
be located.
(6) Restoration of damaged structures. If a building is damaged or
destroyed by fire or other casualty, it may be repaired or
reconstructed in the same location with the same habitable floor
area and height, or less, as it existed prior to such fire or other
casualty, notwithstanding that prior to such fire or other casualty it
fell within the definition of "nonconforming use, legal," or
"nonconformity other than use, legal," of this chapter. However, any
such repair or reconstruction must comply with all fire,
construction, health and safety rules, regulations, ordinances and
laws applicable at the time of repair or reconstruction. Substantial
work of any such repair or reconstruction must be commenced
within a period of 24 months after the damage or destruction of the
building and shall be diligently prosecuted to completion.
[Amended 7-11-1995 by L.L. No. 7-1995]
(7) (Reserved)45
(8) Compliance with limitations on external effects of uses. In order
that all legal nonconforming uses may gradually be brought into
greater conformity with the chapter or the adverse external effects
of such nonconforming uses may be reduced, the Planning Board
may review any nonconforming use and propose a plan where,
through better screening areas, control of outdoor storage, noise,
smoke, odors, lighting and other characteristics described in
§ 60-420B(3), architectural changes, location and layout of parking
areas and access drives, or by other appropriate means, such
purposes may be achieved. Such plan shall be presented to the
Town Board, which, after public notice and hearing, may approve
such plan. Within a period of not more than three years from the
date the Town Board approves such a plan, the owner of the
property where the nonconforming use is located shall bring such
use into compliance with such plan as a condition of continuing its
legal nonconforming status under this chapter.
F. Off-street parking and loading facilities.
(1) General. All structures and land uses shall be provided with a
sufficient amount of off-street parking to meet the needs of persons
employed at or making use of such structures or land uses and
sufficient off-street facilities to meet the needs of such structures or
45.Editor's Note: Former § 60-425.6, Removal of existing nonconforming signs, was repealed
10-14-1997 by L.L. No. 18-1997.
§ 60-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-420
1:341
land uses, but not less than the minimum standards of § 60-42F(3)
and (6). No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any
structure or land use until the required off-street parking and
loading space has been established. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the B-RP District, the requirement for providing offstreet
parking and loading spaces shall be waived where the
applicant has voluntarily offered to dedicate to the parking district
or the Town of New Castle an easement over the entire designated
parking/loading/circulation/setback area on the site proposed for
development for off-street parking, loading and/or circulation
purposes. [Amended 3-12-1991 by L.L. No. 5-1991]
(2) Existing structures and uses.
(a) Structures and land uses in existence or for which building
permits have been approved at the time of the adoption of this
chapter shall not be subject to the parking or loading space
requirements of this chapter, provided that any parking and
loading facilities then existing to serve such structures or uses
shall not, with the exceptions hereinafter provided, in the
future be reduced except where they exceed such
requirements. Required parking and loading facilities for the
existing portion of such shall, however, be provided at the time
of any enlargement of such existing structures or uses in the
future. [Amended 10-8-1974]
(b) In case of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship to such
properties arising out of this requirement, appeal may be made
to the Board of Appeals, which shall require such degree of
compliance as it may deem reasonable for that part of the
structure or use that is legally nonconforming, but shall not
waive any part of the requirement for that part of the structure
or use that constitutes an enlargement or expansion, and shall
not permit reduction or elimination of whatever quantity of
parking or loading that may already exist, unless it is in excess
of requirements, in which case it shall not be reduced below
such requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case of
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, the Board of
Appeals may waive part or all of the parking requirement in
connection with the expansion of a place of worship when such
use is located within a business district and when the expanded
facilities shall be used solely on Sunday or after 6:00 p.m. or in
connection with worship services, provided that said Board
shall attach such conditions and safeguards to the waiver as it
may deem necessary to protect the public health, safety,
morals and general welfare. [Amended 10-8-1974]
(c) Required off-street parking facilities which after development
are later dedicated and accepted by the Town shall be deemed
to continue to serve the uses or structures for which they were
originally provided.

Parking
Other uses not listed
[Amended
11-28-2017 by L.L.
No. 11-2017]
Reasonable and appropriate off-street
parking requirements for types of uses
that do not fall within the categories
listed above shall be determined by
the Planning Board or Zoning Board,
where applicable, which shall consider
all factors entering into the parking
needs for such use. Where the use is
not subject to review and approval by
the Planning Board or the Zoning
Board, the reasonable and appropriate
off-street parking requirements shall
be determined by the Building
Inspector in consultation with the
Director of Planning, and in
accordance with International
Transportation Engineers (ITE)
parking demand data.
[2] Where two or more different uses occur on a single lot, the
total amount of parking facilities to be provided shall be
the sum of the requirements for each individual use on the
lot, except that the Planning Board may approve the joint
use of parking spaces by two or more establishments on
the same or contiguous lots, the total capacity of which is
no more than 15% less than the sum of the spaces required
for each, provided that the Planning Board finds that the
capacity to be provided will substantially meet the intent
of the requirements by reason of variation in the probable
time of maximum use by patrons and employees among
such establishments, and provided that such approval of
such joint use shall be automatically terminated upon the
termination of the operation of any such establishments. If
more than one lot is involved, the Planning Board shall
require, as condition of its approval, a legal instrument,
satisfactory to the Town Attorney, assuring the continued
use of joint parking facilities in connection with the uses
they serve.
(b) Size of parking spaces. Unless specifically provided for
elsewhere in this chapter or in applicable state codes, each
parking space shall be at least nine feet in width and 18 feet in
depth, if unenclosed, and at least 10 feet in width and 18 feet in
depth if bordered by walls or columns on two or more sides, all
exclusive of aisles and driveways appurtenant thereto. Such
spaces shall be known as standard parking spaces. Exceptions
to this requirement may be permitted as follows:
§ 60-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-420
1:347
[1] Where standard parking spaces are defined by curbs
providing space for the overhang of vehicles, such spaces
may, in the discretion of the Planning Board, be reduced in
depth to 16 feet, provided that vehicles will not encroach
upon sidewalks or other pedestrian areas, and further
provided that at least three feet of separation is provided
between the overhang space of adjacent parking bays.
[2] Parking spaces designated for use by employees may be
permitted by the Planning Board, provided that such
spaces are used on a nontransient basis (car parked for at
least three hours in the same space) and are reserved
exclusively for employees, and further provided that at
least 10% of the required number of spaces are standard
parking spaces which shall be reserved for visitors.
Employee parking spaces shall be at least eight feet six
inches in width and 18 feet in depth.
[3] On sites containing nonresidential uses which require at
least 50 or more off-street parking spaces, the Planning
Board may, in its discretion, permit up to 25% of the
spaces provided to be compact spaces, provided that such
spaces are grouped together on the lot in appropriate
location and are clearly marked as being reserved for
compact cars only. Compact parking spaces shall be at
least eight feet in width and 16 feet in depth.
[4] Parking spaces designated for use by handicapped persons
shall be at least 13 feet in width and 18 feet in depth and
shall include a designated access aisle of at least five feet
in width. Such spaces shall be located along the most
direct circulation route to an accessible building entrance
and shall be sited so that it is not necessary for a
handicapped person to travel along any vehicular aisle
enroute to an accessible walkway. Handicapped parking
spaces shall be so designated with appropriate signage.
(4) Location of off-street parking facilities.
(a) The required off-street parking facilities shall be provided on
the same lot or premises with the structure or land use they
serve, except that off-street parking spaces required for
structures or land uses on two adjoining lots may be provided
in a single common facility on one or both of said lots, and
except that the Planning Board may permit all or part of the
required spaces to be located on any lot entirely within 250
feet of the building or land use in the same zoning district or
another zoning district where such parking is a lawful use, if
the Planning Board determines that it is impractical to provide
parking on the same lot with the building.
§ 60-420 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-420
1:348
(b) Where the Planning Board approves the location of such
parking spaces on a lot which is different from the lot occupied
by the use served by the parking spaces, the Planning Board
shall require, as a condition of its approval, a legal instrument,
satisfactory to the Town Attorney, assuring the continued use
of said parking spaces in connection with the land uses and
structures they serve.
(5) Operation and maintenance of off-street parking facilities.
Required off-street parking facilities shall be maintained as long as
the use or structure exists which the facilities are designed to
serve. Required parking spaces developed for specific structures
and uses shall be reserved at all times for those persons who are
employed at or make use of such structures and land uses, except
when dedicated to and accepted by the Town as public parking
areas.
(6) Off-street loading requirements. Off-street loading facilities shall
be located on the same lot with the use to be served and shall meet
the following requirements:
(a) For retail and service business establishments, restaurants and
other places serving food and beverages: one space for the first
10,000 square feet of floor area or portion thereof, provided
that it is in excess of 1,500 square feet used for business
purposes, and one space for each additional 10,000 square feet
or major portion thereof.
(b) For industry, wholesale businesses, storage warehouses and
other commercial establishments: one space for the first 5,000
square feet or portion thereof in excess of 1,500 square feet
used for such purposes and one additional space for each
10,000 square feet or major portion thereof in excess of the
first 5,000 square feet.
(c) For research laboratories and office buildings: one space for
the first 25,000 square feet or major portion thereof and one
additional space for each additional 150,000 square feet or
major portion thereof. [Added 6-22-1983 by L.L. No.
5-198347]
(d) For nursery schools and/or day-care centers, the number, size
and location of the loading area(s) required shall be
determined by the Planning Board, provided that not less than
one such loading area shall be required for each nursery
school/day-care center. Where a nursery school/day-care
center shares common parking and/or circulation areas with
another use, the nursery school/day-care center's loading
requirement may be satisfied by such other use's required
47.Editor's Note: This local law also redesignated former § 60-426.6(c) and (d) as
§ 60-426.6(d) and (e).

loading area, provided that the applicant demonstrates to the
Planning Board's satisfaction that joint use of such loading
area will adequately meet the aggregate needs of both uses.
[Added 7-12-1994 by L.L. No. 13-199448]
(e) Off-street loading requirements for structures and land uses
which do not fall within the categories listed above shall be
determined by the Town Board and adopted as an amendment
to this chapter.
(f) Where, because of the special nature of a particular business
or industrial use, the Planning Board determines that the
above amount of off-street loading space would exceed the
actual need, at least initially, the Board may permit the
construction of a lesser number of such spaces, provided that
the site plan indicates the location of potential additional
loading spaces which the Planning Board determines may be
needed in the future and contains adequate notations to assure
the eventual construction of such spaces if and when the need
for them is determined by the Planning Board. [Amended
6-22-1983 by L.L. No. 5-1983]
(7) Improvement of parking and loading facilities.
(a) Improvement.
[1] Required off-street parking and loading facilities may be
enclosed in a structure or may be open, provided that all
such facilities shall be graded, surfaced, drained and
suitably maintained to the satisfaction of the Town
Engineer, to the extent necessary to avoid nuisances of
dust, erosion or excessive water flow across public ways or
adjacent lands. In appropriate situations, the Town
Engineer may require that the parking area be provided
with suitable markings to indicate individual parking
spaces, maneuvering area, entrances and exits.
[2] Where the Planning Board determines that the immediate
use of any property may not require the full improvement
of all off-street parking and loading facilities, the Planning
Board may waive the improvement of no more than 1/3 of
the required number of spaces, provided that the total
number of spaces is shown on the approved plan, provided
that the area not to be improved is reserved for future use
(if and when needed) and further provided that
satisfactory guaranties, approved by the Planning Board
and the Town Attorney, are given for the eventual
improvement of any such spaces which may have been
waived within six months of the date of the mailing to the
48.Editor's Note: This local law also provided for the renumbering of former § 60-426.6(d)
and (e) as § 60-426.6(e) and (f), respectively.

1:350
property owner of a copy of the Planning Board resolution
deeming that such spaces, in that Board's opinion, have
become necessary and must be constructed.
(b) Internal landscaping.
[1] In all off-street parking areas containing 25 or more
parking spaces, at least 6% of the total parking area shall
be curbed and landscaped with appropriate trees, shrubs
and other plant materials as determined necessary by the
reviewing authority to assure the establishment of a safe,
convenient and attractive parking facility. Whenever
possible, raised planting islands at least eight feet in width
shall be used to separate opposing rows of parking spaces
so as to provide adequate space for plant growth and for
pedestrian circulation. Such raised planting islands and
the landscaping within them shall be designed and
arranged in such a way as to provide vertical definition to
major traffic circulation aisles, entrances and exits; to
channel internal traffic flow and to prevent indiscriminate
diagonal movement of vehicles; and to provide relief from
the visual monotony and shadeless expanse of a large
parking area.
[2] The selection, amount and location of all landscaping
materials shall be subject to approval by the reviewing
authority, based upon considerations of the adequacy of
the proposed landscaping to serve its intended purpose
with a minimum amount of maintenance problems,
including plant care, snowplowing and leaf removal. At
least one tree, of not less than three inches caliper at a
height of three feet above grade, shall be provided within
such parking area for each 12 parking spaces.
[3] All landscaping shall continue to be maintained in a
healthy growing condition throughout the duration of the
structure or use which it is intended to serve.
(c) Buffer screening. Except for one-family dwellings, suitable
evergreen landscaping and screening shall be provided
between parking areas and adjoining property in residence
districts. [See § 60-420D(2) for requirements.]
(8) Driveways. [Amended 6-24-1980 by L.L. No. 8-1980; 2-9-1993
by L.L. No. 5-1993]
(a) General. For reasons of traffic safety, both on- and off-street, as
well as to provide for possible future road widening and/or
other improvements, all new driveways entering onto any
street shall comply with all requirements of this chapter and
shall be subject to the approval of the Town Engineer, except
§ 60-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-420
1:351
where such are part of a use subject to special permit or
site development plan approval under § 60-430 or § 60-440,
respectively. The approving authority may require the
applicant to furnish necessary topographic, design and other
pertinent information to demonstrate to its satisfaction that
driveways from the street to the building site can be
constructed in accordance with the standards of this chapter
and that such driveways are designed to provide adequate and
convenient space for turning vehicles around on the subject
property so as to avoid requiring such vehicles to be backed
out onto a sidewalk or into a street right-of-way.
(b) Driveway grades.
[1] The maximum grade for any new driveway appurtenant to
one or more one-family dwellings and connecting their
required off-street parking areas to a street shall be 14%,
except that where it can be demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Town Engineer that, because of
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship affecting a
particular property, the construction of a driveway with a
grade of 14% or less is impractical, the Town Engineer
may permit the construction of a steeper driveway,
provided that the increase in driveway grade is the
minimum increase required, and further provided that in
no case shall such driveway grade be permitted to exceed
16%.
[2] The maximum grade for new driveways appurtenant to
uses other than one-family dwellings and connecting the
required off-street parking area to the street shall not
exceed 10%, except that the Planning Board, with respect
to site plans and special permits over which it has
jurisdiction, or the Board of Appeals, with respect to
special permits over which it has jurisdiction, as the case
may be, shall have the same power to permit increased
grades here as in Subsection F(8)(b)[1] above, provided
that in no case shall such grades be permitted to exceed
12%.
[3] Notwithstanding the maximum permitted grades specified
in Subsections (1) and (2) above, no driveway entering
onto any street shall have a grade greater than 5% within
35 feet of the center line of the traveled way of the street
or within 10 feet of the property line of the street,
whichever distance is more restrictive. The Town
Engineer, with respect to one-family dwellings, may permit
the amount of this grade to be increased to 7% where it is
demonstrated to his satisfaction that, because of practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship affecting a particular
§ 60-420 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-420
1:352
property, a lesser grade would be impractical and the
driveway would still be adequate.
[4] Notwithstanding the maximum permitted grades specified
in Subsections (1), (2) and (3) above, the maximum
permissible change of driveway grade shall be 6%. If
necessary to avoid a change of greater than 6%: (a) one or
more transition sections of not less than 20 feet in length
or (b) a vertical curve of not less than 100 feet in length
shall be provided.
(c) Driveway alignment and location. The platform portion of a
driveway required, in accordance with § 60-420F(8)(b) above,
to have a grade of 5% or less shall be aligned at approximately
right angles to the street. The approving authority shall also
require any other design modification which, in its opinion, is
necessary to assure that any driveway entering onto a street
shall be located and aligned in such a way as not to create any
traffic hazard. Driveways shall be located at a minimum of 50
feet from the theoretical edge of all interconnecting streets
extended, except where a lesser distance may be approved
upon application to the Planning Board. Except as set forth
below, no more than one curb cut providing driveway access to
a lot containing a one-family dwelling shall be permitted. In the
R-2A District, one additional curb cut providing access to a lot
containing a one-family dwelling shall be permitted, provided
that it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Planning
Board that such lot could theoretically be subdivided in
accordance with all applicable dimensional requirements of
this chapter. Where a driveway loop is proposed on a lot
containing a one-family dwelling, the nearest edge of such
driveway loop shall not be located in a front yard unless it is set
back from the front lot line a distance equal to that required for
a principal building in the district in which such lot is located.
Such driveway loop shall also be located wholly outside any
wetlands or adjacent area, wetlands buffer as defined in
Chapter 137, Wetlands, or Chapter 64, Environmental
Protection Overlay Regulations, if the property is located
within Environmental Protection Overlay District, of the Code
of the Town of New Castle. [Amended 7-23-2002 by L.L. No.
5-2002]
(d) Visibility. Clear visibility shall be provided so that an
automobile stopped on the platform portion of a driveway, as
required by § 60-420F(8)(b)[3] above, shall, at the intersection
of the driveway with the street, have adequate stopping sight
distance in both directions and so that automobiles traveling
on such street shall also have adequate stopping sight
distance. Stopping sight distance requirements shall be as
specified in the latest edition of "A Policy on Geometric Design
§ 60-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-420
1:353
of Highways and Streets," published by the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials
(AASHTO). Such minimum sight distance requirements may
be increased, as determined necessary by the Town Engineer
in the exercise of his professional judgment, based upon
consideration of the particular driveway and street
characteristics, including but not limited to the number of
vehicles projected to use the driveway on a regular basis.
(9) Alternative method of providing parking spaces. Where, because of
limitations of size, dimensions or topography of lot, an applicant for
a building permit in a business district finds it impracticable to
provide all or a portion of the off-street parking spaces required in
connection with a proposed building or addition, he may offer to
grant and convey to the Town or an existing parking district
appropriately located and developed land for commercial parking
in an equivalent amount. If the Planning Board concurs in such
finding and in the appropriateness of the proposed land for
parking, the Town Board or such existing parking district, at its
discretion, may accept such developed land, provided that it is
permanently dedicated.
G. Parkland or parkland fees with multifamily site plan approval. [Added
5-22-1990 by L.L. No. 26-1990; amended 9-12-1995 by L.L. No.
9-1995]
(1) Legislative intent. Pursuant to the authority duly vested in it and
upon a finding that a proper case exists in accordance with the
provisions of Town Law § 274-a, it is the intention of the Town
Board to require the provision of parkland and recreation land in
conjunction with developments in the following multifamily
residential district and for the following uses: Multifamily
Residence -- Chappaqua (MFR-C), Multifamily Residence --
Millwood (MFR-M), Multifamily Planning Development (MFPD) and
Multifamily Designed Residential Development (MFDRD). The
Town of New Castle finds that multifamily housing places an added
burden on the Town in providing adequate park and recreation
areas to serve the needs of multifamily housing residents. In the
event that it is not practical for a particular development to provide
park and recreation areas, it is in the best interest of the Town and
its residents to require funds to be paid to the Town exclusively for
neighborhood parks, playgrounds or recreational purposes,
including the acquisition of property. Such funds will be intended to
benefit primarily, but not exclusively, the residents of the
development subject to the fee.
(2) Recreation areas. Consistent with the requirements of
§ 60-420G(1) and except as provided in § 60-420G(3) below, each
multifamily development shall include a park and/or recreation
area ("recreation area") which is planned, designed and maintained
for the exclusive use of the residents of such development and their
§ 60-420 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-420
1:354
nonpaying guests. The recreation area for a multifamily
development in MFR-C, MFR-M and MFPD Districts shall
constitute not less than 12% of the total site area, of which at least
75 square feet of lot area per dwelling unit or not less than 50
square feet per bedroom, whichever is greater, shall be improved
with the recreational facilities as determined necessary by the
Planning Board. The recreation area in an MFDRD shall constitute
not less than 8%, 5% or 3% of the total site area in the R-1/2A,
R-1A or R-2A District, respectively, of which at least 150 square
feet of lot area per dwelling unit or not less than 100 square
feet per bedroom, whichever is greater, shall be improved with
the recreational facilities as determined necessary by the Planning
Board. The plan for the recreational area shall be subject to
Planning Board approval as to location, design and adequacy,
taking into consideration the size of the development, the
anticipated occupancy of the units and the anticipated recreational
needs of the population to reside there.
(3) Fee in lieu of setting aside recreation area.
(a) Where the Planning Board determines that a proper case exists
for requiring parklands to be shown on the site plan but that a
suitable recreation area of adequate size for park and
recreation purposes and improved with adequate recreational
facilities cannot be properly located in any such development
or as otherwise not practical, the Board may require, as a
condition of approval of any site plan, a payment to the Town of
the sum pursuant to Subsection G(3)(b) hereof or any part
thereof in proportion to the amount of required land and/or
facilities not provided which shall constitute a trust fund to be
used by the Town exclusively for neighborhood park,
playground and recreation purposes, including acquisition of
property.
(b) Fee Schedule. In a MFR-C, MFR-M, MFPD and MFDRD
District, there shall be a recreation fee for each dwelling unit
as set forth by resolution of the Town Board in the Master Fee
Schedule, which may be amended, based on the following
dwelling unit sizes: efficiency (studio apartment), 1-bedroom
apartment, 2-bedroom apartment, 3-bedroom apartment, and
4-bedroom apartment or single-family detached dwelling.
[Amended 9-10-2002 by L.L. No. 8-2002]
(4) Exemptions.
(a) Property owners whose land is part of a previously approved
subdivision consisting of the same number of lots from which
parkland or a fee in lieu thereof has been provided pursuant to
§ 60-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-420
1:355
the Town of New Castle Subdivision Regulations49 shall be
exempt from the provisions of § 60-420G.
(b) Where a tract of land approved for development under
§ 60-420G(3), for which a fee in lieu of parkland has been
received, is subsequently processed as a subdivision, credit
against any fee normally arising from the subdivision will be
given for any fee already paid under § 60-420G(3). A
development will be exempt from further fees to the extent of
the number of lots or bedrooms for which fees in lieu of
parkland have already been paid, and payment of further fees
shall be required only for the number of lots or bedrooms
which exceed those previously approved.
(c) Accessory apartments shall be excluded from the application of
this chapter.
(5) Waivers. The Town Board, in its discretion, after public hearing,
may waive the payment of the recreation fee otherwise due under
§ 60-420G(3) upon finding that such waiver is necessary and
appropriate to establish eligibility of entitlement to federal, state or
county governmental grants in connection with, or to otherwise
facilitate, a proposed residential development of property meeting
the special needs of Town or school district employees, Town
volunteer service workers, senior citizens or others for lower-cost
housing. [Added 6-22-1993 by L.L. No. 9-1993]
H. Conservation development. [Added 2-8-1999 by L.L. No. 2-1999]
(1) Findings; purpose and intent.
(a) The Town Board of the Town of New Castle hereby finds that a
substantial proportion of the remaining vacant land in the
Town is environmentally sensitive and topographically difficult.
The Town Board further finds that it is to the benefit of all,
wherever practicable, to promote the conservation of
remaining open space, preserve environmentally sensitive
areas in their natural state and preserve the existing aesthetic
qualities of the Town.
(b) The general purposes and intent of this section are to enable
and encourage flexibility and diversity of design and
development of land in such a manner as to promote the most
appropriate use of land, to facilitate the adequate and
economical provision of streets and utilities, to preserve the
natural and scenic qualities of open lands, to protect areas of
meaningful ecological, architectural, scenic and historic value
and to reserve suitable lands for park and recreation purposes.
(2) Authorization to approve conservation subdivisions.

1:356
(a) The Planning Board is hereby authorized, simultaneously with
the approval of a subdivision plat, to modify applicable
provisions of this chapter, subject to the procedures, conditions
and requirements set forth in this § 60-420H, set forth in
§ 113-23.1 of the land subdivision regulations and set forth in
§ 278 of the Town Law. This procedure may be followed:
[1] When applied for by the owner of the land to be subdivided
if, in the judgment and discretion of the Planning Board, its
application would benefit the Town by satisfying one or
more of the purposes set forth in § 60-42H(1); or
[2] Where the Planning Board determines that its application
would benefit the Town by satisfying one or more of the
purposes set forth in § 60-420H(1) and where the Planning
Board determines that one or more of the criteria for
conservation development, as set forth in § 113-23.1 of the
land subdivision regulations, would be met. In this case,
the Planning Board may require the owner of the land to
submit a preliminary subdivision plat application which
reflects such modifications of applicable provisions of this
chapter.
(b) This authorization shall be applicable in all zoning districts
which permit residential development in the Town.
(c) Except as specified in this section, all development standards
and controls of this chapter, the land subdivision regulations
and the Town Code which are otherwise applicable in the
district in which the property is located shall also be applicable
within any conservation development.
(d) Except as otherwise provided in § 60-420H(2)(f) regarding the
type of residential dwelling units permitted, the permitted
principal and accessory uses within a conservation
development shall be the same as those otherwise permitted in
the zoning district in which the property is located.
(e) The number of building lots or dwelling units permitted within
a conservation development shall in no case exceed the
number which could have been permitted, in the judgment of
the Planning Board, if the land were subdivided into lots
conforming to all normally applicable requirements of this
chapter, the land subdivision regulations, the Town Code, the
Westchester County Department of Health regulations and all
other applicable requirements. However, where the plat falls
within two or more contiguous districts, the Planning Board
may approve a conservation development representing the
cumulative density as derived from the summary of all units
allowed in all such districts, and may authorize actual
construction to take place in all or any portion of one or more
§ 60-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-420
1:357
of such districts. The basis for these density determinations
by the Planning Board shall be a conventional preliminary
subdivision plat for the subject property, plus such other
information as may be required by said Board.
(f) The type of residential dwelling units permitted within a
conservation subdivision shall be, at the discretion of the
Planning Board and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
in detached, semidetached and/or attached buildings.
(g) The plat showing such conservation development may include
areas within which structures may be located, the height and
spacing of buildings, open spaces and their landscaping, offstreet
and enclosed parking spaces, streets, driveways and any
other features required by the Planning Board.
(h) Within the framework of the limitations set forth in this
section, § 113-23.1 of the land subdivision regulations and
§ 278 of the Town Law, the Planning Board shall establish, on a
case-by-case basis, the appropriate modifications of lots, bulk
and parking requirements which said Board has determined
are necessary or appropriate to properly accomplish the
purposes and intent set forth in § 60-420H(1), and, where
applicable, one or more of the specified objectives set forth in
§ 113-23.1 of the land subdivision regulations, consistent with
the protection of private property values and the preservation
of the character of land and buildings on neighboring sites. In
the event that the Planning Board that for a particular
application the appropriate modifications will result in a
reduction in minimum lot area or bulk requirements below the
standards applicable to the next less restrictive zoning district
of more than 20% of the lots in the proposed subdivision, the
matter shall be referred to the Town Board for its review and
authorization. The Town Board shall by resolution either
approve, approve with conditions or disapprove the proposed
modifications within 45 days of referral by the Planning Board.
In the event that the Town Board does not act prior to the
expiration of the forty-five-day period, unless such period is
otherwise extended by resolution of the Town Board adopted
prior to its expiration, the Planning Board shall be authorized
to take the requested action.
(i) Applications to further modify the lot, bulk and parking
requirements established pursuant to § 60-420H(2)(h), shall be
made to and determined by the Planning Board or Town Board
as provided under § 60-420H(2)(h) for undeveloped lots.
Applications to vary any of the categories of lot and bulk
regulations specified in § 60-410A, Schedule of regulations for
residence districts; lot and bulk regulations, for developed lots
shall be made to the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance
with § 60-540. The Zoning Board of Appeals may refer any
§ 60-420 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-420
1:358
variance application made under this section to the Planning
Board for a report and recommendation. For categories of
lot or bulk requirements that did not exist at the time the
conservation subdivision was originally approved by the
Planning Board, the zoning district whose standards were
applied to that lot on the original approval for the conservation
subdivision shall be used to calculate the applicable
requirement for the new category of regulation. [Added
9-14-2010 by L.L. No. 10-201050]
(j) Conservation subdivisions shall result in the preservation of
open space areas having meaningful scenic, ecological,
environmental and/or recreational characteristics, with such
access, shape, size and location as determined appropriate by
the Planning Board to satisfy the intended purpose. The
permanent preservation of such open space areas shall be
legally assured to the satisfaction of the Planning Board and
the Town Attorney by filing of appropriate covenants, deed
restrictions, easements or other agreements.
[1] The ownership of conserved land areas shall be divided
equally among all owners of building lots within the
conservation subdivision, except where all or an
appropriate portion of the conserved land areas are
deeded to a recognized conservation organization
dedicated to the preservation of open space and such
dedication is acceptable to the conservation organization
and to the Town Planning Board, or offered for dedication
to the Town of New Castle and the Town Board has voted
to accept such offer. Except in those cases where the
ownership of the conserved land areas is to be vested in
the Town of New Castle or an approved conservation
organization, the subdivider shall execute and file with the
Planning Board such documents as, in the opinion of the
Town Attorney, will be sufficient to create a property
owners' association responsible for the continued
ownership, use and maintenance of all conserved land
areas in accordance with the following requirements:
[a] Membership in the association must be mandatory for
each property owner within the subdivision and for
any successive property owners.
[b] All restrictions on the ownership, use and
maintenance of conserved land areas must be
permanent.
[c] The association must be responsible for liability
insurance, local taxes and the maintenance of the

§ 60-430. Permitted special uses.
conserved land areas, including any active recreation
areas and related facilities.
[d] Each lot owner within the subdivision shall be made
responsible for paying a proportionate share of the
association's costs, and the assessment levied by the
association shall become a lien on the property if not
paid.
[e] The association shall have the power to adjust
assessments to meet changing needs.
[f] In the event that the maintenance, preservation and/
or use of the conserved land area(s) ceases to be in
compliance with any of the above requirements or any
other requirements specified by the Planning Board
when approving the subdivision plat, the Town shall
be granted the right to take all necessary action to
assure such compliance and to assess against the
association and/or each individual property owner
within the subdivision all costs incurred by the Town
for such purposes.
[g] The establishment of such an association shall be
required prior to the final approval of the plat.
[2] Except where otherwise approved by the Planning Board,
conserved land areas shall be preserved in their natural
state and the use of such areas shall be limited to
appropriate conservation, open space and recreation
purposes as determined by the Planning Board.
A. General provisions. The special uses for which conformance with
additional standards is required by this chapter (See schedules of
regulations, § 60-410A and B.51) may be considered to be permitted
uses in their respective districts, subject to the satisfaction of the
requirements and standards set forth in this section in addition to all
other requirements of this chapter. All such uses are declared to
possess characteristics of such unique and special forms that each
specific use shall be considered as an individual case.
B. Application for special permit. Application for required special permits
shall be made to the Zoning Board of Appeals, except where Town
Board or Planning Board approval is expressly provided in the Town
Code, in which case the same requirements and procedures as set forth
in this chapter for the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be applicable to
such Boards. Each application for a special use permit shall also be
51.Editor's Note: Said Schedules are included at the end of this chapter.
§ 60-420 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-430

development plan complying with the requirements of § 60-440B or
a subdivision plat complying with the requirements of Chapter 113,
Subdivision of Land, if appropriate, and, except for special use permits
requiring approval by the Planning Board, shall be referred to the
Planning Board for report, which report shall be rendered within 45
days of the date such referral is received by the Planning Board
Secretary. Each application for a special use permit, together with
a detailed development plan, shall also be referred to the Board of
Architectural Review for report and recommendation on the
architectural features of the proposed development in accordance with
the purposes and criteria as set forth in § 60-550 of this chapter, which
report shall be rendered within 45 days of the date such referral is
received by the Board of Architectural Review. A public hearing shall
be conducted within 62 days of the date a completed application under
this section is received. Public notice of the hearing shall be printed in a
newspaper of general circulation in the Town at least five days prior to
the date of the public hearing. The authorized board shall decide upon
the application within 62 days after the close of the public hearing. The
time within which the authorized board must render its decision may be
extended by mutual consent of the applicant and the board, provided
however, that the failure to comply with the time requirements of this
section shall not result in approval by default of the special use permit
application. The decision of the authorized board on the application
after the holding of the public hearing shall be filed in the office of the
Town Clerk within five business days after such decision is rendered
and a copy mailed to the applicant. Further, the applicant shall post a
sign which shall be located so that it is visible from the nearest public
street on the property referenced in such application at least 10 days
but not more than 20 days prior to the Board of Appeals scheduled
hearing on the matter. Such signs shall be issued by the Secretary of
the Zoning Board of Appeals upon receipt of a security deposit, in an
amount to be set forth by resolution of the Town Board, which security
deposits shall be retained by the Town in the event that the applicant
fails to return the sign within 10 days from the close of the public
hearing. The Board may authorize the issuance of a permit, provided
that it finds that all the following conditions and standards have been
met: [Amended 4-12-1977 by L.L. No. 3-1977; 4-26-1977 by L.L.

(1) In a residence district, the proposed use will serve a community
need or convenience.
(2) The location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the
operations involved in it or conducted in the connection with it, the
size of the site in relation to it and the location of the site, with
respect to streets giving access to it, are such that they will be in
§ 60-430 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-430
1:361
harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the
district in which located.
(3) The location, nature and height of buildings, walls and fences and
the nature and extent of existing or proposed plantings on the site
are such that the use will not hinder or discourage the appropriate
development and use of adjacent land and buildings.
(4) Operations in connection with any special use will not be more
objectionable to nearby properties by reason of noise, fumes,
vibrations or other characteristics then would be the operations of
every permitted use not requiring a special permit.
(5) Parking areas will be of adequate size for the particular use,
properly located and suitably screened from adjoining residential
uses, and the entrance and exit drives shall be laid out so as to
achieve maximum and adequate safety.
C. Conditions and safeguards. The Board of Appeals shall attach such
conditions and safeguards to an approved use and development plan as
are, in its opinion, necessary to ensure initial and continual
conformance to all applicable standards and requirements. In all cases
the Zoning Board shall retain continuing jurisdiction.
D. Action on application; inspection of improvements; certification; fee.
[Amended 9-12-1995 by L.L. No. 9-1995; 7-14-2009 by L.L. No.

of the authorized Board's decision granting the special permit, the
applicant shall, upon payment of any fees prescribed therefor, be
entitled to a building permit or certificate of occupancy, as the case may
be, from the Building Inspector, subject to any conditions and
safeguards recommended by the Board and further subject to the
requirements of Chapter 48 of the Code of the Town of New Castle. The
Building Inspector shall not issue a building permit or a certificate of
occupancy in the event that the Board of Appeals shall not make a
finding that all of the enumerated conditions prevail. [Amended
11-22-2011 by L.L. No. 15-2011]
F. Inspection of improvements. The Town Engineer shall be responsible
for inspecting certain required improvements, such as construction of
streets, utilities, parking lots, retaining walls, landscaping, stormwater
facilities and/or other improvements that may be required by the
approving Board during construction to ensure their satisfactory
completion and, upon such completion, shall furnish the authorized
Board with a statement to that effect. If the Town Engineer determines
that any of the certain required improvements have not been
constructed in accordance with the approved special permit
requirements, the applicant shall be responsible for properly
completing said improvements. Failure of the Town Engineer to carry
§ 60-430 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-430
1:362
out inspection of certain required improvements during construction
shall not in any way relieve the applicant or a bonding company of
his or its responsibilities related to the proper construction of such
improvements.
G. Inspection of stages of construction.
(1) To facilitate inspection of required improvements during
construction, the applicant shall notify the Town Engineer at least
three working days before reaching each of the following stages of
construction:
(a) Rough grading completed.
(b) Drainage and other underground facilities installed, but prior
to backfilling.
(c) After gravel base is spread and compacted.
(d) When each pavement course is being applied.
(e) After completion of all improvements.
H. The applicant shall not proceed to work on any stage subsequent to the

approved by the Town Engineer or the Town Engineer's duly authorized
representative. In the case of any other improvements, the Town
Engineer shall inspect the work at such progressive stages as the Town
Engineer shall specify, and the Town Engineer shall certify to the
authorized Board that the work was inspected by the Town Engineer
and was in accordance with the approved plans and specifications.
I. Certification of mix data. Upon request of the Town Engineer or the
Town Engineer's duly authorized representative, the applicant shall

contractor shall cut and transport the necessary sample to a laboratory
selected by the Town Engineer. Costs of tests and reports shall be borne
entirely by the applicant.
K. Certificate of construction. At such time as the applicant has completed
construction of all required improvements, the applicant shall furnish
to the Town Engineer three copies of as-built plans and profiles which
show the actual location of all paved streets, culverts, headwalls,
drains, manholes, catch basins, sidewalks, curbs, utility lines and
equipment, street signs, street trees and all other required
improvements, as constructed, and all other pertinent information,
such as cross sections of the streets at intervals determined by the
Town Engineer, the culvert and drain grades, sewer grades, sidewalk
§ 60-430 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-430
1:363
and curb grades and invert elevations at manholes. Such plans and
profiles shall bear a date certification by a professional engineer or
licensed surveyor to the effect that the data shown thereon was
accurately determined by filed survey. If the location or accuracy of
improvements does not, in the opinion of the authorized Board, fully
comply with the approved construction plans and specifications, the
authorized Board shall have the right to refuse to sign the final plat or
release the bond until such situation is corrected.
L. Inspection fee. To offset the costs incurred by the Town in conducting
inspections for approval of special permits involving the construction of
streets, utilities, parking lots, retaining walls, landscaping, stormwater
facilities and/or other improvements, all applicants granted special
permit approval involving such improvements shall be required to
submit an inspection fee, payable to the Town of New Castle, equal in
amount to 3% of the estimated cost of improvements as determined by
the authorized Board.
M. Expiration of special permits. A special permit shall be deemed to
authorize only the particular use or uses specified in the permit and
shall expire if said use or uses shall cease for more than six months for
any reason or if all required improvements are not completed within 18
months from the date of issue. The Board of Appeals shall have the
power and authority to designate terms and conditions which it deems
material and essential in connection with any special use permit. Upon
finding that a material and essential condition of the permit has been
violated, the Board of Appeals may adopt a resolution terminating the
permit. The permit holder shall be entitled to a public hearing before
the Board of Appeals as to the occurrence of any such violation, upon
five days' written notice. [Amended 9-25-1979 by L.L. No. 13-1979]
N. Existing violations. No permit shall be issued for a special use for a
property where there is an existing violation of this chapter or Chapter
48 of the Code of the Town of New Castle. [Amended 11-22-2011 by
L.L. No. 15-2011]
O. Additional standards and requirements for particular uses.
(1) Gas and electric power transmission lines and transformer and
switching stations. [Amended 4-8-1997 by L.L. No. 7-1997]
(a) Applicants for permits to establish power transmission lines or
transformer or switching stations and customary accessory
uses in residential zones shall prepare and submit to the
Zoning Board of Appeals sufficient evidence to permit that
Board to arrive at a finding, in addition to all other findings
required by this section (§ 60-430), that service cannot be
supplied adequately and reasonably by such facilities located
in a business or industrial district; that a public necessity exists
for such facilities in the residential area; and that the
particular site for which application is made is the least
§ 60-430 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-430
1:364
objectionable of possible sites from the public standpoint and
takes into consideration future as well as present needs.
(b) Any lot on which a transformer station is located shall have an
area of at least 10,000 square feet and a frontage of at least
100 feet. The station shall be set back at least 50 feet from the
front property line and 25 feet from all other property lines and
shall be enclosed by protective fencing and a gate which shall
be closed and locked except when necessary to obtain access
thereto.
(c) Any such facilities shall be so designed, enclosed, painted or
colored and screened with evergreens that they will be
harmonious with the residential area in which located. All such
property shall be suitably landscaped and maintained in
reasonable conformity with the standards of property
maintenance of the neighborhood in which located.
(d) The applicant for a permit to install a new, enlarged or
replacement transformer or switching station shall include as
part of the application a current study of the feasibility of
installing such facilities underground and shall, if required by
the Board, furnish such other data, studies and reports as will
enable the Board to determine whether the particular facility
for which a permit is sought should be required to be placed
underground. All new or additional power transmission or
distribution lines shall be placed underground.
(2) Places of worship, private schools, day nurseries, colleges, day play
schools, summer theaters, riding academies, public libraries,
museums and art galleries.
(a) Location. The special uses listed in this subsection may be
permitted in residence districts only in locations fronting on or
having direct access to major or collector roads as determined
by the Planning Board and shown on the Town Development
Plan Map.
(b) Coverage. Building coverage, including accessory buildings,
shall not exceed 20% of the lot area, nor shall the sum total of
the land covered with buildings and parking, including
driveways, exceed 50% of the lot area, within any residence
district.
(c) Setbacks. All buildings shall be set back from adjoining
properties in residence districts and street lines directly
opposite properties in residence districts a distance equal to at
least twice the height of such building, but in no case less than
50 feet, except 25 feet for accessory buildings not over one
story or 12 feet in height located in a side or rear yard. Offstreet
parking areas shall not be permitted in any required
§ 60-430 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-430
1:365
front yard, nor in any required side or rear yard within 15 feet
of any adjoining property in a residence district.
(d) Buffer area. A landscaped buffer area, meeting at least the
minimum requirements of § 60-420D(2) of this chapter, shall be
required along all lot lines adjoining properties in residence
districts.
(e) Other requirements. In addition to the special standards
described above, places of worship, private schools, day
nurseries, day play schools, colleges, summer theaters and
riding academies shall comply with any other requirements of
this chapter and any other special requirements deemed
appropriate by the Board of Appeals in accordance with the
requirements of this section (§ 60-430).
(3) Research and Office Business (B-RO) Districts. Within a Research
and Office Business (B-RO) District, all development shall conform
to the following additional standards and requirements in addition
to all other applicable standards and requirements of this chapter:
(a) No more than one main building or group of buildings serving a
single user, and its accessory structures, shall be located on
any one lot; and all business uses, other than off-street parking,
shall be conducted within fully enclosed buildings.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the B-RO-20 District,
buildings may be occupied by more than one user and by
multiple tenants. [Amended 6-22-1983 by L.L. No. 5-1983;
6-7-2005 by L.L. No. 4-200552; 4-12-2010 by L.L. No.
3-2011]
(b) Each lot in a Research and Office Business District shall have
frontage on and access to a major road as determined by the
Planning Board and shown on the Town Development Plan Map
or frontage on and access to a street approved by the Town
Planning Board as a part of a subdivision of land for the
purpose permitted in a Research and Office Business District,
provided any such new street is laid out so that it will not be
necessary for the principal traffic generated by the business
use to travel through any areas having residential frontage
before reaching a major road. The connection between any
such new street and a major road hall be adequate in location,
design and capacity so as to avoid unsafe conditions and traffic
congestion.
(c) In approving the development of any use within the Research
and Office Business District, the approving authority shall
consider the location and height of all buildings and related
52.Editor's Note: This local law also provided it would expire upon the adoption of a
subsequent zoning change that would permit any use or combination of uses not
permitted as of 6-7-2005 on any property located in the B-RO-20 Zoning District.
§ 60-430 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-430
1:366
uses with respect to the topography of the property, with the
objective of securing the maximum harmony of such buildings
and uses with the surrounding landscape.
(d) In permitting the development of any property in the Research
and Office Business Districts, the approving authority may
require interior or exterior screening or shading to avoid the
emission of artificial light from any building on the premises
during the hours of darkness after 7:00 p.m.
(e) The approving authority is hereby authorized, when approving
the issuance of a special permit for uses within the Research
and Office Business District, to limit, in terms of employees or
other appropriate measure, the maximum size or density of any
use so as to ensure that the potential generation of traffic from
such use will be properly related to the capacity of the street
system serving it.
(f) The minimum required side and rear yard setback in the BRO-
150 Research and Office Business District may be reduced
to 150 feet by the Planning Board where said Board determines
that adequate separation and screening for present and
potential future residences on adjacent properties will be
provided by virtue of existing topographic conditions such as
wetlands, ridges or steep slopes or existing or proposed
vegetation. In no case, however, shall a principal building
exceed the height of a plane defined by a vertical angle of 7°
above the horizontal originating at a point 10 feet above the
mean level of the land immediately adjacent to the facing wall
of any residence building existing on a neighboring residential
property as of February 1, 1983, or a point five feet above the
center line of the traveled way of any adjacent public highway,
when such building would be located within 500 feet of such
adjacent residential property or public highway. An exception
to this additional setback restriction may be permitted by the
Planning Board where intervening natural topography or
evergreen vegetation would substantially shield or obstruct the
view of a higher building from the point at which the plane is
established. In any case, where a principal building is to be
constructed within 300 feet of an adjacent residential property,
the Planning Board may require an evergreen buffer area of
not less than 25 feet in depth, which shall be designed to
substantially obstruct or screen any portion of such building
within the three-hundred-foot setback area as viewed from a
point 10 feet above the ground where any existing or potential
future residential structure is or may be located. [Added
6-22-1983 by L.L. No. 5-1983]
(4) Monasteries and private clubs.
§ 60-430 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-430
1:367
(a) Location and use. Where monasteries and private clubs do not
front on or have direct access to a major or collector road as
determined by the Planning Board and shown on the Town
Development Plan Map, the intensity of use shall be limited by
the Board of Appeals to the extent necessary to assure that the
expected average traffic generation of such use will not exceed
that which would be expected if the premises were developed
for permitted residential purposes.
(b) Buffer area. A landscaped buffer area, meeting at least the
minimum requirements of § 60-420D(2) of this chapter, shall be
required along all lot lines adjoining properties in residence
districts.
(c) Special setback requirements. All active recreational facilities,
such as tennis courts and swimming pools, shall be located out
of doors and shall be set back from adjacent residential
property boundaries at least twice the minimum distance
required for residential buildings in the district in which they
are located, except that the Board of Appeals may permit a
reduction of this additional setback requirement where,
because of topography or the installation of additional buffer
landscaping and/or fencing, the Board of Appeals determines
that any potential adverse external effect of such use can be
effectively reduced.
(d) Other requirements. In addition to the special standards
described above, any private club shall comply with any other
requirements of this chapter and any other special
requirements deemed appropriate by the Board of Appeals in
accordance with the requirements of this section (§ 60-430).
(5) Nursing homes.
(a) Location. Nursing homes shall be permitted in residence
districts only in locations fronting on or having direct access to
a state or county road.
(b) Site size. The minimum site size for a nursing home in a
residence district shall be 10 times the normally required
minimum lot size for a one-family dwelling as specified in
§ 60-410A, Schedule of regulations for residence districts.53
(c) Density. The maximum permitted density shall not exceed five
patient beds for each amount of land area equal to the
minimum lot size requirement for a one-family dwelling in the
residence district in which it is located. If located in a
nonresidential zoning district, there shall be not more than one
patient bed for each 2,500 square feet of lot area.
53.Editor's Note: Said Schedule is located at the end of this chapter.

(d) Coverage. Building coverage, including accessory buildings,
shall not exceed 10% of the lot area, nor shall the sum total of
land covered with buildings and parking, including driveways,
exceed 30% of the lot area, within any residence district.
(e) Setbacks. All buildings shall be set back from adjoining
properties in residence districts and from street lines directly
opposite properties in residence districts, a distance equal to
at least twice the height of such building, but in no case less
than 50 feet, except 25 feet for accessory buildings not over
one story or 12 feet in height located in a side or rear yard. Offstreet
parking areas shall not be permitted in any required
front yard, nor in any required side or rear yard within 15 feet
of any adjoining property in a residence district.
(f) Off-street parking and loading. Minimum off-street parking
requirements for nursing homes shall be one space for each
person employed on the maximum shift, including staff
doctors, plus one space for each two patient beds. One offstreet
loading space shall be provided for each 100 patient
beds or major portion thereof.
(g) Buffer area. A landscaped buffer area, meeting at least the
minimum requirements of § 60-420D(2) of this chapter, shall be
required along all lot lines adjoining properties in residence

described above, nursing homes shall comply with any other
requirements of this chapter, any other special requirements
deemed appropriate by the Board of Appeals in accordance
with the requirements of this section (§ 60-430), and all other
applicable laws and regulations governing nursing homes.
(6) Institutional uses. [Added 4-14-1973]
(a) Location and minimum site size. Institutional uses shall be
permitted in residence districts only on sites equal to at least
10 acres or 10 times the lot size requirement for the district in
which it is located, whichever is the greater, in locations
fronting on or having direct access to a major road as
determined by the Planning Board and shown on the Town
Development Plan Map, except that the Zoning Board of
Appeals may permit such an institutional use to locate on any
other property containing an area equal to at least 25 acres or
25 times the minimum lot size requirement for the district in
which it is located, whichever is the greater, provided such
property has been occupied by another institutional or
monastery use permitted by this chapter.
§ 60-430 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-430
1:369
(b) Intensity of use. The intensity of use shall be limited by the
Zoning Board of Appeals to the extent necessary to cure that
the anticipated average traffic generation and other effects of
such use will not exceed that which would be expected if the
premises were developed for permitted residential purposes.
In no case, however, shall the maximum number of persons
permitted to occupy institutional sites amount to more than the
number resulting from dividing the total site area by the
minimum lot size requirement for the district in which it is
located and multiplying by two to determine the maximum
number of persons who shall be permitted to occupy the site on
a regular daily basis, and by three to determine the maximum
number of persons who shall be permitted to occupy the site at
any one time for any purpose. Residents on a permanent basis
shall be limited only to those employees and their families
necessary for the proper operation and maintenance of the
facility. The overnight lodging of temporary guests may be
allowed only while they are participating in permitted
functions of the institution as set forth in the special permit,
and for periods not to exceed three days.
(c) Coverage. Building coverage, including accessory buildings,
shall not exceed 10% of the lot area, nor shall the sum total of
land covered with buildings and parking, including driveways,
exceed 30% of the lot area, within any residence district.
(d) Setbacks. Setbacks for all buildings shall be at least twice the
distance required for residential buildings in the district in
which they may be located, except that, with respect to
existing buildings, the Zoning Board of Appeals may reduce the
required setback to the minimum required for residential
buildings in the zoning district in which the premises are
situated, where the Zoning Board finds that such reduction will
not adversely affect surrounding properties or be otherwise
inconsistent with any of the requirements and standards
provided in this section. Setbacks for off-street parking areas
shall be at least equal to the setbacks required for residential
buildings in the district in which they are located. Where
determined appropriate by the Zoning Board of Appeals, new
buildings shall be spaced so as to allow possible future
subdivision in accordance with the lot size and setback
standards of the district in which they are located. [Amended
5-7-1973]
(e) Off-street parking and loading. Minimum off-street parking
requirements for institutional uses shall be two spaces per
resident family, plus one space for each permanent employee
and one space for each three temporary guests.
(f) Landscaping and buffer areas. All institutional sites shall be
attractively landscaped in accordance with plans approved by
§ 60-430 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-430
1:370
the Zoning Board of Appeals. A buffer area meeting at least the
minimum requirements of § 60-420D(2) of this chapter shall
be required along all lot lines adjoining or directly across the
street from properties in residence districts. Such planting
and landscaping shall be properly maintained at all times in
accordance with such specifications so as to promote a
development harmonious with adjoining residential properties.
(g) Other requirements. In addition to the special standards
described above, an institutional use shall comply with all
other requirements of this chapter and any other special
requirements deemed appropriate by the Zoning Board of
Appeals in accordance with the provisions of this section,
§ 60-430.
(h) The Zoning Board of Appeals, in its decision granting special
use permits under this section shall identify and set forth the
number of acres covered by such special use permit and shall
also set forth the maximum number of persons permitted to
occupy the site on a regular daily basis and at any one time for
any purpose. A special use permit granted hereunder shall be
void if the property for which it has been approved is
subdivided or otherwise reduced in size.
(7) Fast-food restaurants. [Added 4-12-1977 by L.L. No. 3-1977]
(a) Location. Fast-food restaurants shall be permitted only when
located in multitenanted buildings.
(b) Traffic impact. The Planning Board shall, in each individual
case, consider the potential traffic impact of the proposed fastfood
restaurant on the adjoining road system. Where said
Board determines that such traffic may have a significant,
adverse impact, it may deny the application or it may require
such reduction in scale or other modification of the size and
nature of the proposed facility as, in the opinion of said Board,
will be adequate to reduce the estimated impact to an
acceptable level.
(c) Waste material. All waste material shall be stored in
rodentproof containers which shall be kept in a screened or
enclosed location and shall be removed from the premises each
day, with the exception of Sundays and holidays.
(d) Other requirements. In addition to the special standards
described above and the general standards for special permit
uses as set forth in this chapter, the Planning Board may, as a
condition of approval of any such special permit application,
establish any other additional standards, conditions and
requirements, including a limitation on hours of operation, as it
may deem necessary or appropriate to promote the public
§ 60-430 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-430
1:371
health, safety and welfare and to otherwise implement the
intent of this chapter.
(8) Group instruction. The following special standards and
requirements shall apply to group instruction when permitted as an
accessory use in a principal dwelling in a residence district, and
shall be in addition to all other standards and requirements of
§ 60-430, as well as the applicable requirements for other
customary home occupations as set forth in § 60-410G: [Added
8-22-1978 by L.L. No. 5-1978; amended 3-27-2018 by L.L. No.

(a) The maximum number of pupils shall be limited to five at any
one time.
(b) Off-street parking shall be provided in an amount as
determined adequate for the particular use by the board
authorized to grant special permit approval for group
instruction. If the Planning Board is not the approving
authority, the application shall be referred to the Planning
Board for review and report pursuant to § 60-430B. The
Planning Board's report to the approving authority shall
include a recommendation as to the number of parking spaces
required for the special permit application.
(9) Multifamily Designed Residential Developments (MFDRD). The
development of an MFDRD shall be permitted only upon the
issuance of a special permit by the Planning Board and shall be
subject to the specific requirements set forth herein in addition to
the appropriate general procedures, conditions and standards
applicable to special permit uses as set forth in § 60-430 of this
chapter. [Added 10-29-1979 by L.L. No. 16-1979]
(a) Purpose and intent. It is the specific purpose and intent of
permitting MFDRD's to allow a low-density form of multifamily
housing on the Town's remaining large parcels of residentially
zoned land so as to add to the variety of housing forms
presently and potentially available in New Castle, to encourage
the preservation of open space and natural features, to obtain
the most environmentally and economically sound forms of
residential development in accordance with modern planning
design criteria and to otherwise achieve social, environmental
and economic benefits in accordance with the Town Plan and
for the benefit of all present and future residents of New Castle
and the region.
(b) Special development standards.
[1] Site requirements.
[a] Site size. The minimum required area for an MFDRD
shall be equal to 100 times the minimum lot size
§ 60-430 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-430
1:372
required for one-family dwellings in the district in
which it is located. If permitted by the Planning Board,
the minimum site area need not be located entirely
within the Town of New Castle, provided that a plan is
proposed and similarly approved for the balance of the
property in the neighboring community, and further
provided that the density and dwelling unit mix on the
New Castle portion of any such site does not exceed
that which is allowed pursuant to this chapter.
[Amended 4-11-1990 by L.L. No. 21-1990]
[b] Ownership. A proposed MFDRD site may be owned by
one or more persons or corporations but shall be
presented as a single parcel of land at the time the
special permit application is made. Such parcel may
include lands which are divided by street rights-ofway,
provided that the lands are situated, in whole or
in part, directly across from each other so that they
would be contiguous were it not for the intervening
right-of-way. The special permit application shall be
jointly filed by all owners and, if approved, shall be
jointly binding on all of them. If required by the
Planning Board, this shall be confirmed by written
agreement, in recordable form satisfactory to the
Town Attorney.
[2] Traffic access. Traffic access to MFDRD sites shall be
adequate to accommodate the anticipated traffic
generation resulting from the multifamily development
proposed thereon. In the event that primary frontage and
access to a proposed MFDRD site is over a Town or county
road, the Planning Board shall not issue the required
special use permit until and unless said Board determines
that the Town or county road is capable of accommodating
the additional traffic generation or, if not, that the
necessary improvements will be made prior to the
occupancy of any dwelling units in the MFDRD.
[3] Permitted uses. The permitted principal and accessory
uses within the MFDRD shall be the same as those
permitted in the MFR districts and those principal uses as
permitted and regulated in the one-family residence
district in which it is located; provided, however, that onefamily
detached dwellings shall constitute not more than
25% of the total number of dwelling units in the MFDRD
and except that for all such uses permitted, the Planning
Board shall be the governing authority. [Amended
5-26-1981 by L.L. No. 3-1981; 4-11-1990 by L.L. No.
21-1990; 6-14-1990 by L.L. No. 27-1990]
§ 60-430 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-430
1:373
[4] Density. The basic permitted density within an approved
MFDRD shall be calculated as in the MFR-C District,
except that it shall be based upon the following minimum
lot area standards:

The maximum permitted incentive density increase within
an approved MFDRD shall be determined by the Planning
Board as in the MFR-C District, except that it shall be
limited to a total of not more than 20% of the basic
permitted density.
[a] Nonwetland areas. The density increase attributable
to the nonwetland portion of the site shall be
determined in accordance with the following schedule
of incentive features and corresponding permitted
density increases:

[b] Wetland areas. The criteria for approving any density
increase attributable to the wetlands portion of any
site shall be those set forth in § 60-410H(2)(a)[2][b] of
this chapter.
[5] Utilities and services.
[a] Water and sewer service. All MFDRD's shall be located
within public water and sewer service districts. Where
such district(s) does not presently exist on a proposed
MFDRD site, a special district shall be created
therefor prior to or as a condition of the approval of
the issuance of the special permit. All dwelling units
within an MFDRD shall be connected to such public
water and sewer systems in accordance with
standards approved by the Town Engineer, the
54.Editor's Note: Former Item 5, which listed energy-efficient design features as an incentive
feature, was repealed 12-10-1985 by L.L. No. 19-1985. Said local law also redesignated
former Item 6 as Item 5.
§ 60-430 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-430
1:375
Westchester County Health Department and any other
county, state or federal agencies having jurisdiction.
All dwelling units shall be separately metered for
water.
[b] Drainage. Stormwater drainage systems serving any
MFDRD shall be designed so that the rate of runoff
from the site during a one-hundred-year storm will not
exceed that which would have occurred prior to its
construction. The calculation of such runoff rate and
the design of the drainage system shall be subject to
the approval of the Town Engineer. The Planning
Board may, based upon the recommendation of the
Town Engineer, waive or reduce this requirement
where it is determined that, due to the nature or
location of the property within its watershed, such a
standard may be unnecessary or inappropriate.
[Amended 3-27-1984 by L.L. No. 2-198455]
[c] Refuse storage and collection. Plans for the storage
and collection of refuse within any MFDRD shall be
subject to Planning Board approval. Refuse shall be
stored in rodentproof containers which shall be
conveniently located to serve all dwelling units and
shall be enclosed or otherwise screened from view.
Such facilities shall comply with all setback
requirements applicable to principal buildings.
[d] Undergrounding. All utilities within any MFDRD,
including electric, telephone and cable television
service, shall be placed underground.
[6] Coverage. The maximum permitted building coverage
within an MFDRD shall be 10% and the maximum
permitted development coverage shall be 20%. Such
coverage shall be calculated on the basis of nonwetland
areas only. [Amended 5-23-1995 by L.L. No. 6-1995]
[7] Off-street parking. Off-street parking shall be provided in
accordance with the standards of § 60-420F of this chapter
and shall also comply with the special standards applicable
to MFR-C Districts as set forth in § 60-410H(2)(e) hereof.

1:376
[b] Private outdoor space. In addition to the above, each
individual dwelling unit shall be provided with private
outdoor space in the form of a patio, terrace, garden,
courtyard, deck and/or balcony, which space shall be
immediately adjacent and directly accessible to the
dwelling unit which it serves. As a general guide, such
private outdoor space shall equal at least 15% of the
gross floor area of the dwelling unit it serves.
[Amended 4-11-1990 by L.L. No. 21-1990]
[c] Other open spaces. All lands within an MFDRD which
are not used for one or more of the purposes
enumerated above shall be designed and maintained
as permanent open space, either to be improved and
landscaped or to be preserved in their natural state,
all in accordance with plans and restrictions as may be
approved by the Planning Board.
[9] Other requirements.

(d) Setbacks and buffer areas. The setback requirements shall in
each individual case be established by the Town Board and
specified on the site development plan approved as a part of
the special use permit. In establishing setback restrictions, the
Town Board will take into consideration the specific nature of
the proposed use, the characteristics of the site upon which it
will be located, the relationship of the site to neighboring
properties and uses and such other factors as the Board may
determine appropriate, but in no case shall the location of any
building, pens or runs where animals are kept, or any areas
where manure or other odor- or dust-producing substances are
stored, be permitted closer than 250 feet to any property line.
Within such setback areas, evergreen landscaping or other
forms of visual screening shall be provided by the applicant to
the extent determined necessary by the Town Board. Such
buffering shall be shown on the approved site development

L.L. No. 30-1990]
(a) Applicants for permits to expand the activities permitted at an
athletic training center shall prepare and submit to the
Planning Board sufficient evidence to permit that Board to
arrive at a finding, in addition to all other findings required by
§ 60-430 of this chapter, that adequate and safe access and
traffic circulation patterns exist and that adequate off-street
parking is available to accommodate the expanded use of such
facility.
(b) Traffic access and circulation. The Planning Board is hereby
authorized, when approving the issuance of a special permit
for the ancillary uses described herein, to limit in terms of

participation levels, the scheduling of activities and/or other
appropriate measures, the maximum size and/or density of any
such ancillary use(s) so as to ensure that the on-site circulation
system and the public roadway system can safely
accommodate the increased traffic associated with such
expanded use of the facility and so that the potential traffic
generation from such use(s) will be properly related to the
capacity of the street system serving it.
(c) Parking. The Planning Board is hereby further authorized,
when approving the issuance of a special permit for the
ancillary uses described herein, to establish a supplementary
parking requirement for those uses in addition to that required

(z) Revocation of non-small wireless facility permit.
[1] If any non-small wireless facility is constructed, repaired,
rebuilt, placed, moved, relocated, modified or maintained
in a way that is inconsistent or not in compliance with the
provisions of this subsection or of the non-small wireless
facility permit conditions and requirements, or it is
determined conclusively that the applicant made
materially false or misleading statements during the
applicant process, then the Planning Board or the Building
Inspector, or their designee, shall notify the holder of the
non-small wireless facility permit in writing of such
violation. Such notice shall specify the nature of the
violation or noncompliance, and the violations must be
corrected within seven days of the date of the postmark of
the notice, or of the date of personal service of the notice,
whichever is earlier. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this subsection or any other provision of this
subsection, if the violation or noncompliance causes,
creates or presents an imminent danger or threat to the
health or safety of lives or property, the Planning Board or
Building Inspector may, at their sole discretion, order the
violation remedied within 24 hours.
[2] If the non-small wireless facility is not brought into
compliance with the provisions of this subsection, or of the
permit, or substantial steps are not taken in order to bring
the affected non-small wireless facility into compliance,
then the Planning Board or the Building Inspector may
revoke such non-small wireless facility permit and require
removal of such non-small wireless facility.
(aa) Removal.
[1] Under the following circumstances, the Town may
determine that the safety, public welfare, character and
environment of the Town warrant and require the removal
of non-small wireless facilities, under the following
circumstances:
§ 60-430 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-430
1:397
[a] The non-small wireless facility has been abandoned
(i.e., not used as wireless telecommunications
facilities) for a period exceeding 90 consecutive days
or a total of 180 days in any 365-day period, except for
periods caused by force majeure or acts of God, in
which case repair or removal shall commence within
90 days;
[b] A permitted non-small wireless facility falls into such a
state of disrepair that it creates a safety hazard;
[c] The non-small wireless facility has been located,
constructed, or modified without first obtaining, or in
a manner not authorized by, the required special use
permit, or any other necessary authorization; or
[d] Any non-small wireless facility is determined to be in
violation of this subsection and fails to cure such
violation within the time set forth herein.
[2] If the Planning Board makes a determination pursuant to
§ 60-430O(14)(aa)[1], then it shall notify the holder of the
non-small wireless facility permit and the owner of the
property in writing that said non-small wireless facility is
to be removed.
[3] The holder of the non-small wireless facility permit or the
owner of the property shall be required to dismantle and
remove such non-small wireless facilities, and all
accessory equipment and associated structures, from the
site and return the site to its original condition and certify
through soils or other testing that no contamination has
been created by the facility, such restoration being
completed, limited only by physical or commercial
impracticability, within 90 days of receipt of written notice
from the Town to remove such non-small wireless
facilities. However, if the owner of the property upon
which the non-small wireless facility is located wishes to
retain any access roadway to the non-small wireless
facilities, the owner may do so with the approval of the
Town.
[4] If the non-small wireless facility is not removed or
substantial progress has not been made to remove the nonsmall
wireless facility within 90 days after the small facility
permit holder has received such written notice of removal,
then the Planning Board may order officials or
representatives of the Town to remove the non-small
wireless facility at the sole expense of the property owner
and/or non-small wireless facility permit holder.
§ 60-430 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-430
1:398
[5] If the Town removes or causes to be removed the nonsmall
wireless facility, and the owner of the wireless
telecommunications facility does not claim and remove
them to a lawful location within 10 days, then the Town
may take steps to declare the non-small wireless facility
abandoned and dispose of or sell them and their
components and retain the proceeds therefrom. The Town
may also cause the costs associated with the removal and
disposal of the non-small wireless facility to be assessed on
the property in the same manner as a tax or assessment.
(bb) Performance security. The applicant and the owner of record of
any proposed wireless telecommunication services facility, at
their cost and expense, shall be jointly required to execute and
file with the Town a bond, or other form of security acceptable
to the Town as to type of security and the form and manner of
execution, in an amount to be determined by the Town
Engineer, based on actual estimates supplied by the applicant,
ensuring removal of the facility upon expiration or termination
of the special use permit or cessation of facility; and with such
sureties as are deemed sufficient by the Planning Board to
assure the faithful performance of the terms and conditions of
this section and conditions of any special use permit issued
pursuant to this subsection. The full amount of the bond or
security shall remain in full force and effect throughout the
term of the special use permit and/or until any necessary site
restoration is completed to restore the site to a condition
comparable to that which existed prior to the issuance of the
special use permit. Upon written application by the applicant,
the Town may, at its sole option, permit the amount of the bond
to be reduced or waive the bond requirement.

[1] The special use provided for by this section shall be
permitted only in principal buildings that are located in the
B-R or the B-RP Districts on lots within 1,500 feet of the
Chappaqua railroad station building or in principal
buildings that are located in the I-G District on lots within
§ 60-430 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-430
1:399
500 feet of the Chappaqua railroad station building. These
distances shall be measured along a straight line
connecting the closest point of the Chappaqua railroad
station building to the closest point of the property line of
the site on which such use is proposed to be established.
[2] No dwelling unit proposed to be established pursuant to
this section shall be located closer than 1/10 mile to any
five other dwelling units established and operated
pursuant to this section on another site or sites. This
distance shall be measured along a straight line
connecting the two closest points of the property lines of
the site for which the dwelling unit is to be provided and
the other site or each of the other sites.
[3] Dwelling units provided under this section may be
established alone or in combination with other permitted
principal uses, provided that 100% of the dwelling units
provided qualify as workforce housing.
[4] Subject to the special standards set forth below, the lot,
bulk and dimensional requirements applicable to
workforce housing shall be the requirements of the B-R
District contained in the Schedule of Regulations for
Business and Industrial Districts, Lot and Bulk Regulations
 Part 4, regardless of the district in which the lot is
located.
(c) Dwelling units.
[1] Dwelling unit type. Individual dwelling units may be of the
efficiency, studio, one-bedroom or two-bedroom type, but
shall not contain more than two bedrooms. The Town
Board, in consultation with the Town Building Department,
shall have the authority to determine which rooms may
function as bedrooms for the purpose of determining
compliance with this requirement and may include any
room other than bathrooms, kitchens, entranceways,
foyers and closets under the definition of a bedroom. This
determination shall be based upon consideration of the
floor plans proposed by the applicant and such other
information as the Town Board may determine
appropriate. The mix of dwelling unit types established
pursuant to this section in any particular workforce
housing development shall be satisfactory to the Town
Board.
[2] The foregoing notwithstanding, the Town Board may
authorize the establishment of three-bedroom dwelling
units if there is a demonstrated need for larger dwelling
units, if the site on which such dwelling units are proposed
§ 60-430 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-430
1:400
can support the increased population density that is
anticipated to result, and if the potential impacts
associated with a larger site population can be
satisfactorily accommodated.
[3] The floor area for an individual dwelling unit shall be at
least 300 square feet, but in no case shall it exceed 1,200
square feet.
[4] All dwelling units shall comply with all applicable
provisions of the New York State Building Codes and all
other applicable laws.
(d) Density.
[1] The site proposed for the establishment of dwelling units
authorized by this section shall contain at least the
minimum amount of lot area specified below for each type
of dwelling unit:
Dwelling Unit Type
Minimum Gross Lot Area
Required Per Dwelling
Unit
(square feet)
Efficiency (studio)
apartment
250
One-bedroom apartment 375
Two-bedroom apartment 500
Three-bedroom apartment 625
[2] For the purpose of calculating the permitted density as
described above, the determination of dwelling unit type
shall be based upon the provisions of § 60-430O(15)(c)[1]
of this chapter.
(e) Occupancy. The number of occupants residing in a dwelling
unit established pursuant to this section shall be the greater of:
(i) one occupant per efficiency apartment approved pursuant to
§ 60-430O(15)(c) herein; (ii) one occupant per 90 square feet of
bedroom space approved pursuant to § 60-430O(15)(c) herein
or, in either case; (iii) if the project is financed by a public
agency, the minimum number of occupants permitted for the
dwelling unit by the agency providing the financing for such
dwelling units.
(f) Off-street parking.
[1] Off-street motor vehicle parking.
§ 60-430 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-430
1:401
[a] Off-street parking spaces for motor vehicles shall be
provided in accordance with the standards and
requirements of § 60-420F of this chapter for
multifamily dwellings in business districts.
[b] No more than one of the minimum required motor
vehicle parking spaces for each dwelling unit may be
designed or reserved exclusively for the use of the
occupants of that unit.
[c] At least 20% of the minimum number of required
motor vehicle parking spaces shall be designed and
reserved for the use of visitors and guests.
[d] The foregoing notwithstanding, the Town Board may
reduce any or all of the requirements set forth in
§ 60-430O(15)(f)[1][a] and/or [c] above if, in its
discretion, such Board finds that a lesser number of
motor vehicle parking spaces is appropriate based
upon consideration of the location of municipal
parking facilities, the existence of arrangements made
by the applicant for the leasing of private motor
vehicle parking spaces on another site within walking
distance of the proposed dwelling units, the
anticipated use of bicycling and/or availability of other
modes of transportation, or such other considerations
as the Town Board may deem relevant to the
evaluation of motor vehicle parking demand
associated with the dwelling units established
pursuant to this section.
[2] Off-street bicycle parking.
[a] Off-street bicycle parking facilities shall be provided
for any dwelling unit established pursuant to this
section in any new building or as part of an addition to
or enlargement of an existing building that results in
the need for additional off-street motor vehicle
parking facilities.
[b] A minimum of one bicycle parking space shall be
provided for each five dwelling units, except that in no
event shall fewer than two bicycle parking spaces be
provided for any workforce housing development
established pursuant to this section.
[c] Off-street parking facilities for bicycles shall be
designed to provide for appropriately sized and secure
storage of bicycles, and shall be conveniently located
in relation to building entrances and so as to avoid
conflicts with vehicular and pedestrian circulation
features.
§ 60-430 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-430
1:402
[d] The foregoing notwithstanding, the Town Board may
reduce any or all of the requirements set forth in
§ 60-430O(15)(f)[2][a] and [b] above if, in its
discretion, such Board finds that a lesser number of
bicycle parking spaces is appropriate based upon
consideration of the site location, the location of
municipal bicycle parking facilities, the network of
available bicycle paths, or such other considerations
as the Town Board may deem relevant to the
evaluation of bicycle parking demand associated with
the dwelling units established pursuant to this section.
(g) Water and sewer service. Any dwelling unit established
pursuant to this section shall be served by public water supply
and public sewer service systems. Prior to the issuance of a
building permit for any such dwelling unit, approval of the
proposed method of water supply and sewage disposal shall be
obtained from the Westchester County Department of Health
and shall be further subject to approval by the Town Engineer,
acting in consultation with the Commissioner of the Town of
New Castle Department of Public Works.
(h) Other utility services. If a connection to cable television service
is not proposed to serve the building containing dwelling units
established pursuant to this section, a central exterior radio/
television antenna system or earth station shall be provided in
accordance with plans approved by the Town Board. Exterior
antennas for individual apartments shall not otherwise be
permitted. Provision shall be made for connecting all proposed
communication utility services to the building at a single
location. The proposed location of the common utility area
shall be depicted on the site plan approved by the Town Board.
(i) Refuse storage and collection. Plans for the storage and
collection of refuse within any building containing apartments
shall be subject to Town Board approval, acting in consultation
with the Commissioner of the Town of New Castle Department
of Public Works. The outside storage of refuse, if permitted,
shall be in rodentproof containers conveniently located and
enclosed or otherwise screened from view.
(j) Apartment access. In a building containing nonresidential
uses, the portion of the building that is used for residential
purposes shall have an entrance that does not require access
through the portion of the building that is used for
nonresidential purposes.
(k) Management and finance. For all dwelling units established
pursuant to this section, the applicant shall demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Town Board that there will be adequate
management and maintenance. To facilitate the Town Board's
§ 60-430 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-430
1:403
evaluation of these considerations, the applicant shall be
required to submit a management plan showing how the
dwelling units will be maintained, how income eligibility will
be monitored, and how the limitations on dwelling unit resale
prices and/or rental costs will be calculated over time.
(l) Compliance with law. The applicant shall demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Town Board that the applicant has complied
with or is in the process of complying with all applicable
federal, state and municipal laws, rules and regulations. The
applicant shall also demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Town
Board that the dwelling units established pursuant to this
section shall be in compliance with all such laws, rules and
regulations. The continued validity of the special permit for
such dwelling units shall be dependent upon demonstration by
the applicant to the satisfaction of the Town Board that such
proposed dwelling units are in compliance with all such laws,
rules and regulations during the time of their occupancy.
(m) Duration of special permit. Special permits granted pursuant
to this section shall be valid for a minimum of 25 consecutive
years, or such longer period as may correspond to the duration
of the applicant's commitment to maintain an income
restriction for occupancy in such dwelling units, from the date
on which the resolution granting the permit is filed in the Town
Clerk's office, and such permits shall be automatically
renewable upon the demonstration to the Town Board by the
applicant or its successors and/or assigns that the dwelling
units established pursuant to this section have been operated
in compliance with all requirements of the special permit and
of this section and are not at the time of such renewal in
violation of any applicable federal, state or municipal law, rule
or regulation. Each renewal shall be valid for a period of at
least 25 consecutive years, or such longer period as may
correspond to the duration of the commitment to maintain an
income restriction for occupancy in such dwelling units,
commencing with the date of filing of the resolution granting
such extension in the office of the Town Clerk.
(n) Deed restriction(s). As a condition of the approval of the
original special permit, the applicant shall be required to
submit in form satisfactory to Town Counsel:
[1] Declaration(s) in recordable form to ensure that:
[a] The provisions of § 60-430O(15) of this chapter
concerning income limits for occupancy in a
workforce housing dwelling unit and the total
percentage of workforce housing dwelling units whose
occupancy is so restricted shall remain in effect for
the duration of the term of the special permit; and
§ 60-430 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-430
1:404
[b] Such other conditions as the Town Board may deem
appropriate shall remain in effect for the duration of
the term of the special permit; and
[2] A sample form of the proposed lease, deed, and/or
certificate to be used to convey any interest in any unit
with legend(s) thereon setting forth any restriction on
transfer under any such declaration(s).
(o) Other requirements. In addition to the special standards
described above, dwelling units established pursuant to this
section shall comply with all other requirements of this chapter
and any other special requirements deemed appropriate to the
Town Board in accordance with § 60-430, unless the Town
Board waives any standard or requirement pursuant to
§ 60-430O(15)(q) below.
(p) Waiver of fees. The Town Board, in its discretion, may waive
the payment in whole or in part of any fee otherwise due under
this chapter upon finding that such waiver may further
eligibility of entitlement to federal, state or county
governmental grants in connection with, or to otherwise
facilitate, a proposed residential development of property
meeting the needs of Town or school district employees, Town
volunteer service workers, senior citizens or others for lowercost
housing. Such waiver shall also be based upon
consideration of the intended duration of the income
restriction for occupancy in such dwelling units. Where such
fees have been paid at the time of submission of an application
for special permit approval, the Town Board may authorize a
refund of such fees.
(q) Modification of requirements. Consistent with New York Town
Law § 274-b(5), the Town Board may waive or modify
application of any provision of this section if it finds in the
circumstances of the particular case that: (i) application of that
provision is not requisite in the interest of the public health,
safety or general welfare or would be inappropriate; and (ii)
application of that provision would obstruct furtherance of the
workforce housing that is proposed. In modifying any of the
provisions of this section, the Town Board will take into
consideration the degree to which compliance with such
standards and/or requirements would result in hardship to the
applicant, the specific nature of the use, the characteristics of
the site upon which it will be located, the relationship of the
site to neighboring properties and uses, and such other factors
as the Town Board may determine appropriate. In permitting
any such modification, the Town Board shall attach such
conditions as are, in its judgment, necessary to secure
substantial compliance with the objective of the provision so
modified.
§ 60-430 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-430
1:405
(r) Coordination with Zoning Board of Appeals. If the Town Board
does not modify the provisions of this section as requested by
an applicant, the applicant may appeal to the Zoning Board of
Appeals in accordance with the procedures contained in Town
Code § 60-540.
(16) Massage establishments. No massage establishment may open,
operate or exist in the Town without first obtaining a special use
permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals following a public
hearing. A property owner or landlord shall not permit a tenant or
subtenant to open or operate a massage establishment within the
Town unless a special permit has been obtained for the demised
premises. [Added 6-9-2015 by L.L. No. 5-2015]
(a) Purpose and intent. The Town of New Castle finds it necessary
to protect the public: i) from unlicensed establishments that
perform massages on unsuspecting persons; ii) from
establishments operating under the guise of being a massage
establishment, as defined herein, when actually engaging in
illegal activities and subjecting the public to exposure to
unclean, unhealthy and possibly contaminated conditions; and
iii) from sex trafficking in persons and commercial sexual
exploitation. These illegal activities have a deleterious effect
on the public health, safety and welfare of the Town, its
residents and the public at large. It is the intent of the Town to
regulate the premises from which massage establishments are
operated to promote and protect public health, safety and
welfare.
(b) Definitions. As used in this subsection, the following terms
shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them:

engage in the practice of massage services, except for those
individuals who are exempt from the requirements of this
chapter pursuant to § 60-430O(16)(f).

concerning any site development plan application, the Planning Board
shall consider the nature, arrangement and appearance of all buildings
and uses on the lot, including their potential impact on adjacent
properties, architectural features and land uses, so that they will have a
harmonious relationship with the existing and planned development of
contiguous lands and adjacent neighborhoods; so that they will have no
material adverse effect upon the desirability of such neighborhoods for
the uses contemplated by this chapter; so that they will be properly
related to the proposals of the Town Development Plan; so that due
consideration is given to inclusion of Model Ordinance Provisions AFFH
Units and that inclusion of the same is facilitated; so that the required
parking and loading spaces are provided; so that pedestrian and
vehicular access, traffic circulation and the general layout of the site
§ 60-440 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-440
1:418
are properly planned with regard to the safety of cars and pedestrians
using the site, as well as those on neighboring properties and streets;
so that they will be sited and located to take advantage of solar access
insofar as feasible, including the orientation of proposed buildings
with respect to sun angles, the shading and windscreen potential of
existing and proposed vegetation both on and off the site, the impact on
solar access to adjacent uses and properties; and so that the purpose
and intent of this chapter will otherwise be met, to the end that the
property values will be conserved, the most appropriate use of land
will be encouraged and the health, safety and general welfare of the
community will be furthered. In acting to approve, whether with or
without modifications, a site development plan application, the
Planning Board shall attach such conditions and safeguards as it deems
necessary to assure that the purpose and intent of those regulations
will be complied with. Where the design of the site development plan
requires blasting, the blasting areas and proposed measures to reduce
impacts shall be shown as required by the Planning Board. [Amended

in improved pedestrian or vehicular access or circulation, better
utilization of the property for the proposed use, increased safety
and improvement of the general appearance of the property as a
separate unit and in relation to neighboring properties, the
Planning Board may permit such an adjustment of the designated
building areas or parking/loading/circulation/setback areas,
provided that:
(a) The total amount of building floor space does not exceed the
amount which could otherwise be permitted; and
(b) There is no interference with traffic flow to the parking areas
on adjoining properties.
(2) In order to encourage safe and convenient traffic circulation, the
Planning Board may require the interconnection of parking areas

F. Planning Board initiative. [Amended 11-12-1985 by L.L. No.
18-1985]
(1) Area site plans. The Planning Board may, on its own initiative,
propose a general or specific site plan for a particular area where
site development plan approval may be required in the future,
using, as a guide, the requirements of this chapter.
(2) Area design plans. The Planning Board may, on its own initiative,
propose a general or specific design plan for a particular area
where site development plan approval may be required in the
future, using, as a guide, the requirements of this chapter. Such
area design plans may establish guidelines applicable to the layout
and design of one or more sites as well as the buildings located
thereon, including but not limited to standards for landscaping,
lighting, signage, utility installation, paving materials, pedestrian
amenities, building materials, colors and architectural style. Prior
to its adoption by the Planning Board, each area design plan shall
be referred to the Board of Architectural Review for report and
recommendation, which report shall be rendered within 45 days of
the date such referral is received by the Board of Architectural
Review.
G. Required improvements. [Added 1-8-1980 by L.L. No. 1-1980]
(1) Completion of improvements or filing of bonds. After adoption of a
resolution approving a site development plan and before the plan is
endorsed by the Planning Board Chairman or other duly authorized
member, the applicant shall be required to complete, at his expense
and without reimbursement by the Town or any special district, all
improvements as shown on the approved construction plans or
otherwise specified in the resolution or, as an alternative, file with
the Town Board a bond, letter of credit or other security acceptable
to the Town Board in an amount fixed by the Planning Board in its
resolution as sufficient to secure to the Town the satisfactory
construction, installation and completion of the required
improvements. Such bond, letter of credit or other security shall
state the period within which the required improvements must be
completed, which period shall be that specified in the Planning
Board resolution. In the event that the issuer of the bond or other
security furnished to the Town hereunder becomes insolvent or, for
any reason, disaffirms the validity of such security, the applicant
shall notify the Town Board immediately and replace the invalid
security with a new bond or other security acceptable to the Town
Board within 30 days thereafter. The existence of a valid bond,
letter of credit or other security shall be a condition precedent to
the validity of any permits issued or to be issued in connection with
any site development plan. All improvements shall be done to the
satisfaction of the Planning Board, in accordance with the approved
construction plans and the requirements of this chapter and any
other Town construction standards and specifications. The term
§ 60-440 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-440
1:420
"improvement" shall include all facilities intended to be dedicated
as public facilities and roadways, water and sewer facilities,
drainage and erosion controls and soil stabilization improvements
not intended to be so dedicated. [Amended 6-9-1992 by L.L. No.
10-199259]
(2) Failure to complete improvements.
(a) Where a bond is not filed. If all required improvements are not
completed within the period specified in the Planning Board
resolution of approval, such approval shall be deemed to have
expired, unless, upon request of the applicant, the period has
been extended by resolution of the Planning Board.
(b) Where a bond is filed. If all required improvements are not
completed within the term specified by the Planning Board and
set forth in the filed bond and if no application for extension of
such period and bond has been made by the applicant with the
written consent of the surety company and approved by the
Planning Board, the Town Board may thereupon declare said
bond to be in default and collect the sum remaining payable
thereunder and, upon receipt of the proceeds thereof, the
Town shall install such improvements as are covered by the
bond and are commensurate with the extent of development
that has taken place on the site but not exceeding in cost the
amount of such proceeds.
(3) Modification of bond.
(a) Extension of period specified in bond. The period specified for
the completion of all required improvements, as set forth in the
bond, may be extended only by resolution of the Planning
Board upon request by the applicant with the written consent
of the surety company setting forth in detail the amount of
work which has been completed, reasons for failure to
complete the remainder of the work within the specified
period, the maximum estimated time required to complete the
remainder of the work and the time period extension which is
requested.
(b) Reduction of bond. An applicant may request, in writing, that
the Town Board authorize a reduction in the amount of the
bond. Such request shall itemize the extent of required
improvements already completed, the estimated cost of
improvements remaining to be completed and the amount of
bond reduction requested. It shall be accompanied by a cost
estimate fee as set forth by resolution of the Town Board in the
Master Fee Schedule, which may be amended. Then the Town
Board may, if it determines that sufficient required
59.Editor's Note: This local law stated that it superseded inconsistent provisions of Town Law
§§ 274-a and 277, Subdivision 1.
§ 60-440 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-440
1:421
improvements have been installed to warrant such action,
reduce the face amount of the bond by an appropriate amount
so that the new amount will cover the cost in full of all required
improvements remaining to be completed, and any security
deposited with the bond may be reduced proportionately.
[Amended 3-9-2010 by L.L. No. 2-2010]
(4) Modification of requirements. If, at any time, either before or
during the course of construction of the required improvements, it
is determined by the Planning Board that unforeseen conditions
make it necessary to modify the location or design of any
improvements, the Board may modify the terms and conditions of
the approval so as to require such changes as may be necessary to
comply with the spirit and intent of the Board's original approval
and to conform to accepted engineering practices. If such
modification affects the scope of work covered by a bond, the Board
may require or allow appropriate modification of such bond.
H. Inspection of improvements. The Town Engineer shall be responsible
for inspecting required improvements during construction to ensure
their satisfactory completion and, upon such completion, shall furnish
the Planning Board with a statement to that effect. If the Town Engineer
determines that any of the required improvements have not been
constructed in accordance with the approved plan, the applicant shall
be responsible for properly completing said improvements. Failure of
the Town Engineer to carry out inspections of required improvements
during construction shall not in any way relieve the applicant or the
bonding company of their responsibilities related to the proper
construction of such improvements. [Added 1-8-1980 by L.L. No.
1-1980]
(1) Inspection fee. To offset the costs incurred by the Town in
conducting inspections, all applicants for approval of site plans
involving the construction of streets, utilities, parking lots,
retaining walls, landscaping and/or other improvements shall be
required to submit an inspection fee, payable to the Town of New
Castle, equal in amount to 3% of the estimated cost of
improvements as determined by the Planning Board.

§ 60-530. Penalties for offenses; abatement of violations.

started before the effective date of this chapter or of an amendment
thereto and the ground story framework of which, including the second
tier of beams, has been completed within one year after the adoption of

B. In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed,

§ 60-530 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-540
1:425
B. Alternate members. The Town Board may appoint an alternate member

meetings of the Zoning Board of Appeals but shall only participate in its
deliberations and vote in the event that a member of the Zoning Board
of Appeals is absent or otherwise unable to act with respect to a
particular matter. The Chairperson of the Zoning Board of Appeals may
designate an alternate member to substitute for a member when such

particular application or matter before the Zoning Board of Appeals.
When so designated, the alternate member shall possess all the powers
and responsibilities of such member of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
Such designation shall be entered into the minutes of the initial Zoning

order requirement and decision of the Board shall be filed in the office

without limitation, any order, requirement, decision,
interpretation or determination made pursuant to procedures

§ 267 inconsistent herewith.
§ 60-540 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-540
1:426
in Chapter 48 of the Code of the Town of New Castle as same
shall relate to enforcement of this chapter, and shall make such
order, requirement, decision, interpretation or determination
as in its opinion ought to have been made in the matter by
the administrative official charged with the enforcement of
this chapter, and to that end shall have all the powers of
the administrative official from whose order, requirement,
decision, interpretation or determination the appeal is taken.
[Amended 11-22-2011 by L.L. No. 15-2011]
(b) Use variances.
[1] The Zoning Board of Appeals, on appeal from the decision
or determination of the administrative official charged
with the enforcement of this chapter, shall have the power
to grant use variances, as defined herein.
[2] No such use variance shall be granted by the Zoning Board
of Appeals without a showing by the applicant that
applicable zoning regulations and restrictions have caused
unnecessary hardship. In order to prove such unnecessary
hardship the applicant shall demonstrate to the Board of
Appeals that for each and every permitted use under the
zoning regulations for the particular district where the
property is located:
[a] The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return,
provided that lack of return is substantial as
demonstrated by competent financial evidence;
[b] That the alleged hardship relating to the property in
question is unique and does not apply to a substantial
portion of the district or neighborhood;
[c] That the requested use variance, if granted, will not
alter the essential character of the neighborhood; and
[d] That the alleged hardship has not been self-created.
[3] The Zoning Board of Appeals, in the granting of use
variances, shall grant the minimum variance that it shall
deem necessary and adequate to address the unnecessary
hardship proven by the applicant and at the same time
preserve and protect the character of the neighborhood
and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
(c) Area variances.
[1] The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power, upon an
appeal from a decision or determination of the
administrative official charged with the enforcement of
this chapter, to grant area variances, as defined herein.
§ 60-540 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-540
1:427
[2] In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall take into consideration the benefit to the applicant if
the variance is granted, as weighed against the detriment
to the health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood or
community by such grant. In making such determination
the Board shall also consider:
[a] Whether an undesirable change will be produced in
the character of the neighborhood or a detriment to
nearby properties will be created by the granting of
the area variance;
[b] Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be
achieved by some method, feasible for the applicant to
pursue, other than an area variance;
[c] the requested area variance is substantial;
[d] Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse
effect or impact on the physical or environmental
conditions in the neighborhood or district; and
[e] Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the
Board of Appeals, but shall not necessarily preclude
the granting of the area variance.
[3] The Zoning Board of Appeals, in the granting of area
variances, shall grant the minimum variance that it shall
deem necessary and adequate and at the same time
preserve and protect the character of the neighborhood
and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
(d) Variances when subdivision, site plan or special permit
applications are involved. Where a proposed site plan contains
one or more features which do not comply with the zoning
regulations, or where a proposed special permit use contains
one or more features which do not comply with the zoning
regulations, or where a proposed subdivision plat contains one
or more lots which do not comply with the zoning regulations,
application may be made to the Board of Appeals for an area
variance or variances without the necessity of a decision or
determination of an administrative official charged with the
enforcement of this chapter or a referral by an approving
agency acting pursuant to this chapter.
(3) Conditions and safeguards. The Board of Appeals, in the granting of
both use variances and area variances, may prescribe such
reasonable conditions or restrictions applying to the grant of a
variance as it may deem necessary in each specific case, in order to
minimize the adverse effects of such variance upon the character
and property values of the neighborhood or community and to
§ 60-540 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-540
1:428
protect the public health, safety and welfare. Such conditions or
restrictions shall be directly related to the proposed use of the
property. Such conditions or restrictions shall be incorporated in
the building permit and certificate of occupancy. Failure to comply
with such conditions or restrictions shall constitute a violation of
this chapter, and may constitute the basis for denial or revocation
of a building permit, certificate of conformance or certificate of
occupancy and for all other applicable remedies.
(4) The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have such other powers and
duties as the Town Board shall from time to time determine.
E. Appeal or application. [Amended 6-14-1983 by L.L. No. 4-1983;

provision of the chapter involved and shall exactly set forth, as the
case may be, the interpretation that is claimed, the details of the
adjustment that is applied for and the grounds on which it is
claimed that the same should be granted. All appeals and
applications shall also be submitted to the Board in an electronic
file format. [Amended 8-11-2009 by L.L. No. 10-2009;
3-27-2012 by L.L. No. 1-2012]
(2) Notice of hearing. Notice of any hearing before the Board of
Appeals shall be published by the Board in the official paper at least

amount to be set forth by resolution by the Town Board, which
security deposit shall be retained by the Town in the event that the
applicant fails to return the sign within 10 days after the close of
the public hearing.
(3) Referral to Town Board and Planning Board. The Board of Appeals
shall, not less than five days prior to the date of the required public
hearing, transmit a copy of the application, together with a copy of

(4) Hearing. The Board of Appeals shall conduct a public hearing on
any application made pursuant to this chapter. At such public
hearing all those present and wishing to be heard shall be given an
opportunity to be heard. If the Board of Appeals or the applicant
determines that a stenographic record of such hearing is required,

this chapter.
(3) Rehearing. A motion for the Zoning Board of Appeals to hold a
rehearing to review any order, decision or determination of the
Board not previously reviewed may be made by any member of the
Board. A unanimous vote of all members of the Board then present

is required for such hearing to occur. Such rehearing is subject
to the same notice provisions as an original hearing. Upon such
rehearing the Board may reverse, modify or annul its original order,
decision or determination upon the unanimous vote of all members
then present, provided that the Board finds that the rights vested
by persons acting in good faith in reliance upon the reviewed order,
decision or determination will not be prejudiced thereby.
A. Policy and findings. The Town Board of the Town of New Castle hereby
finds that it is in the best interests of Town residents and protective of
their health, safety and welfare to enact this section of the Code of the
Town of New Castle for the creation of an Architectural Review Board
(hereinafter referred to as "ARB"). The Town Board finds that
monotonous similarity, striking dissimilarity, visual discord or
inappropriateness, and visually offensive, incompatible, or other poor
qualities of design in the exterior appearance of buildings, structures,
or signs can adversely affect the desirability of the immediate and
neighboring areas, impair the use of property, impact the stability in
value of both improved and unimproved property in such areas, prevent
the most appropriate development of properties, and contribute to the
diminution of the taxable value of property in such areas and their
ability to support the municipal services provided therefor.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to provide procedures for the
ARB to undertake the architectural review of certain buildings and
structures henceforth erected, constructed or altered in the Town to:
(1) Protect public investments in the area;
(2) Emphasize aesthetic concerns in the interest of the community;
(3) Foster the attractiveness and functional utility of the community as
a place in which to live and work;
(4) Encourage good qualities and appearances of the exterior design of
buildings, structures and signs;
(5) Relate such design and appearances to the sites and surroundings
of buildings and structures;
(6) Permit originality and resourcefulness in building design and
appearances that are appropriate to the sites and surroundings;
(7) Prevent such design and appearances as are deemed inappropriate
and detrimental to the visual environment and/or viewshed;
(8) Protect the attractiveness and the tax base of the community;
§ 60-540 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-550
1:431
(9) Discourage large expanses of blank walls on structures when
fenestration or other architectural elements would add to the
character of the structure and neighborhood;
(10) Encourage construction of structures of appropriate scale, size and
massing to its immediate community, and discourage inappropriate
structures that may overwhelm and thereby harm its neighbors;
(11)Raise the level of community expectations for the architectural
quality of its environment;
(12) Preserve the character and quality of the Town of New Castle's
heritage by maintaining the integrity of those areas and structures
that have a distinctive character or are of special historic
significance;
(13) Ensure consistent and high quality design standards in the
downtown hamlets of Millwood and Chappaqua with respect to
storefronts, signage, lighting, fixtures, awnings and any visible
rooftop elements; and
(14) Encourage the use of green building measures in the design,
construction and alteration of buildings.

of the ARB shall be appointed Acting Chair, as needed. All meetings
of the ARB shall be duly noticed and open to the public in
compliance with the New York State Open Meetings Law.61

the minutes shall indicate that fact.
E. Jurisdiction.
(1) Referrals for report and recommendation. The ARB shall review
and provide feedback and recommendations on all applications
referred to it for report and recommendation by the Town Board,
Planning Board and Zoning Board of Appeals. The ARB shall issue a
report and recommendation with respect: to such referrals within
45 days of the date such referral is deemed complete pursuant to
§ 60-550F.
(2) Building permit applications. The ARB shall review all applications
filed with the Building Department for a building permit:
(a) For the construction, reconstruction or alteration affecting the
exterior of any building or structure in any residence district
where the cost of such construction, reconstruction or
alteration is reasonably estimated by the Building Inspector to
exceed $25,000.
(b) For the construction, reconstruction or alteration affecting the
exterior of any building or structure in any business district
where the cost of such construction, reconstruction or
alteration is reasonably estimated by the Building Inspector to
exceed $5,000.
(c) Any other building permit application for the construction,
reconstruction or alteration affecting the exterior of any
building or structure which in the judgment of the Building
Inspector involves substantial architectural and design
features that warrant review by the ARB.
F. Complete applications. The Building Inspector shall review each
building permit application and referral to the ARB to determine
whether such application is ready to be placed on an ARB agenda.
Applications will not be accepted for consideration by the ARB until
they are deemed complete by the Building Inspector. The ARB may
require the submission of such additional information and material as it
deems necessary or desirable to reach a proper determination on any
application.
G. Review procedures. The ARB conducts two types of review:
(1) Preliminary Review. In an effort to assist applicants with the design
and development of their project in a manner that will meet with
the approval of the ARB, upon a referral pursuant to § 60-550E(1),
§ 60-550 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 60-550
1:434
the ARB will review a project while it is in the formative or planning
stage. Upon a majority vote of its attending members constituting
a quorum, the ARB shall provide a report and recommendation on
its impressions of the project, special areas of concern that should
be addressed, and advice as to any other areas of the project that
may require special attention or documentation.
(2) Final review. The ARB shall review building permit applications
subject to the criteria set forth in § 60-550E(2). Upon a majority
vote of its attending members constituting a quorum, the ARB
shall: (i) approve the project, with or without conditions; (ii)
disapprove the project, stating the reason(s) for disapproval; (iii)
reserve a final decision on the project, subject to requiring the
applicant to submit additional documentation to the ARB; or (iv)
recommend revisions to the project for submission and
consideration at a future meeting of the ARB.
H. Standard of review. The ARB shall review the compatibility of any
proposed building or structure, or alteration thereto, relative to other
buildings and structures either existing or for which a building permit
has been issued, or to any other building or structure included in the
same permit application, facing upon the same or intersecting street
and within 250 feet of the applicant's property as measured along the
center line of streets in an R-1/4A; within 500 feet of the applicant's
property in the R-1A and R-1/2A Districts; and within 1,000 feet of the
applicant's property within an R-2A District. In fulfilling its
responsibilities under this chapter, the ARB shall also take into account
the natural features of the project site and its surroundings, and the
character of the zoning district and any adopted design guidelines
applicable therein, with a view to conserving the values of property and
encouraging the most appropriate use of land. In making
determinations under this section, the ARB shall consider whether a
proposed building or structure would, if erected or altered as proposed
by the applicant, cause or contribute to one or more of the harmful
effects set forth in § 60-550A by reason of its monotonous design, visual
discord or inappropriateness in respect to one or more of the following
features of exterior appearance:
(1) Size and arrangement of either doors, windows, porticos, porches
or garages, or openings, breaks or extensions in the elevation
facing the street, including reverse arrangement;
(2) When visible from any street or a neighboring house or building,
the treatment of the sides and rear of any proposed structure in
relation to the appearance, amenity and quality of materials to the
treatment given to the street frontage;
(3) Size and shape of all wall planes of the structure, including
additions and renovations;
§ 60-550 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 60-550
1:435
(4) Heights of horizontal building features such as sill levels, lintels
and cornices;
(5) The integrated visual impact of the size, massing, scale, proportion,
height and location of a proposed structure as related to the size
and topography of the property, the location of the building with
respect thereto and to the neighboring structures;
(6) Spacing, dimension and proportion of elements of the basic
structural grid such as columns, piers or large projections such as
porches, balconies or cornices;
(7) Shape and slope of roofs and other roof elements such as gables,
dormers, entry porticos and turrets, their visibility from the street,
and the significance of the profile of the building against the sky or
its background, and the relationship of the massing to its context
and neighbors;
(8) Spacing and proportion of window openings and other aspects of
building fenestration;
(9) The use of unusually bold or odd colors in a commercial district; or
(10) Other features of design that can be reasonably expected to
provoke one or more of the harmful effects set forth in § 60-550A.
I. Effect of Board action. The Building Inspector shall refuse any building
permit application disapproved by the ARB pursuant to § 60-550G(2). If
the ARB shall fail to disapprove any such application referred to it
within 45 days of the date of the public meeting of the Board at which
such application is heard, or if the ARB shall approve any such
application, the Building Inspector shall forthwith issue the building
permit, provided it conforms in all respects to all other applicable laws
and ordinances as well as any conditions required by the ARB. Any
subsequent change in the siting or exterior appearance of the building
which, in the opinion of the Building Inspector, is substantial, shall not
be permitted except upon resubmission to the ARB, and shall be subject
to the enforcement procedures set forth in Chapter 48 of the Code of
the Town of New Castle. Applicants who implement such siting or
exterior changes without the prior approval of the ARB will be
proceeding at their own risk and may be required to perform corrective
work in order to bring their project into compliance with the ARB's
original conditions of approval.
J. Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the action of the ARB in approving or
disapproving a building permit application and/or of the Building
Inspector in denying such permit because of such disapproval may take
an appeal therefrom to the Zoning Board of Appeals in the same
manner as is provided for other zoning appeals, and such Board of
Appeals, after proceeding in the same manner as is provided for other
zoning appeals and with the same power and authority therein vested in
passing upon appeals before it under the provisions of law and this

ENERGIZE NY OPEN C-PACE FINANCING PROGRAM
§ 63-1. Legislative findings; intent and purpose; authority.
A. It is the policy of both the Town of New Castle and the State of New
York to achieve energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements,
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate the effect of global climate
change, and advance a clean energy economy. The Town of New Castle
finds that it can fulfill this policy by providing property assessed clean
energy financing to qualified property owners (as defined below) for the
installation of renewable energy systems and energy efficiency
measures. This local law establishes a program that will allow the
Energy Improvement Corporation (as defined below, "EIC"), a local
development corporation, acting on behalf of the Town of New Castle,
pursuant to a municipal agreement (the "municipal agreement") to be
entered into between the Town of New Castle and EIC, to make funds
available to qualified property owners that will be repaid through
charges on the real properties benefited by such funds, thereby
fulfilling the purposes of this local law and accomplishing an important
public purpose. This local law provides a method of implementing the
public policies expressed by, and exercising the authority provided by,
Article 5-L of the General Municipal Law (as defined below, the
"Enabling Act").
B. The Town of New Castle is authorized to execute, deliver and perform

§ 63-3. Establishment of an Energize NY Open C-PACE Financing
Program.
§ 63-4. Procedures for eligibility.
§ 63-5. Application criteria.
Upon the submission of an application, EIC, acting on behalf of the Town
of New Castle, shall make a positive or negative determination on such
application based upon the following criteria for the making of a financing:
STATE  The State of New York.
A. An Energize NY Open C-PACE Financing Program is hereby established
by the Town of New Castle, whereby EIC, acting on its behalf, pursuant
to the municipal agreement, may arrange for the provision of funds by
financing parties to qualified property owners in accordance with the
Enabling Act and the procedures set forth under this local law, to
finance the acquisition, construction, reconstruction and installation of
qualified projects and eligible costs and financing charges approved by
EIC and by the financing party under the finance agreement. EIC, on
behalf of the Town of New Castle, and with the consent of the benefited
property owner, will record a benefit assessment lien on the benefited
property in the secured amount (the "benefit assessment lien") on the
land records for the municipality. Such recording shall be exempt from
any charge, mortgage recording tax or other fee in the same manner as
if recorded by the Town of New Castle.
B. Before a qualified property owner and a financing party enter into a
finance agreement which results in a loan to finance a qualified project,
repayment of which is secured by a benefit assessment lien, a written
consent from each existing mortgage holder of the qualified property
shall be obtained, permitting the benefit assessment lien and each
annual installment lien to take priority over all existing mortgages.
A. Any property owner in the Town of New Castle may submit an
application to EIC on such forms as have been prepared by EIC and
made available to property owners on the website of EIC and at the
Town of New Castle offices.
B. Every application submitted by a property owner shall be reviewed by
EIC, acting on behalf of the Town of New Castle, which shall make a
positive or negative determination on such application based upon the
criteria enumerated in the Enabling Act and § 63-5 of this local law. EIC
may also request further information from the property owner where
necessary to aid in its determination.
C. If a positive determination on an application is made by EIC acting on
behalf of the Town of New Castle, the property owner shall be deemed a
qualified property owner and shall be eligible to participate in the
program in accordance with § 63-6 of this local law.
§ 63-2 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 63-5
1:448
§ 63-6. Energize NY Finance Agreement.
§ 63-7. Terms and conditions of repayment.

on the qualified property; and
F. Such additional criteria, not inconsistent with the criteria set forth
above, as the state, the Town of New Castle, or EIC acting on its behalf,
or other financing parties may set from time to time.
A. A qualified property owner may participate in the program through the
execution of a finance agreement made by and between the qualified
property owner and a financing party, to which EIC, on behalf of the
Town of New Castle, shall be a third-party beneficiary (the "finance
agreement"). Upon execution and delivery of the finance agreement,
the property that is the subject of the finance agreement shall be
deemed a ("benefited property").
B. Upon execution and delivery of the finance agreement, the benefited
property owner shall be eligible to receive funds from the financing
party for the acquisition, construction, and installation of a qualified
project, together with eligible costs and financing charges approved by
EIC and by the financing party, provided the requirements of the
Enabling Act, the municipal agreement and this local law have been
met.
C. The finance agreement shall include the terms and conditions of
repayment of the secured amount and the annual installment amounts.
D. EIC may charge fees to offset the costs of administering the program
and such fees, if not paid by the financing party, shall be added to the

owner for the qualified project, together with Eligible Costs and
§ 63-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 63-7
1:449
§ 63-8. Levy of annual installment amount and creation of annual
installment lien.
Financing Charges approved by EIC and by the financing party, shall be
specially assessed against the benefited property and will be evidenced
by a benefit assessment lien recorded against the benefited property on
the land records on which liens are recorded for properties within the
Town of New Castle. The special benefit assessment shall constitute a
"charge" within the meaning of the Enabling Act and shall be collected
in annual installments in the amounts certified by the financing party in
a schedule provided at closing and made part of the benefit assessment
lien. Said amount shall be annually levied, billed and collected by the
EIC, on behalf of the Town of New Castle, and shall be paid to the
financing party as provided in the finance agreement.
B. The term of such repayment shall be determined at the time the finance
agreement is executed by the benefited property owner and the
financing party, not to exceed the weighted average of the useful life of
the systems and improvements as determined by EIC, acting on behalf
of the Town of New Castle.
C. The rate of interest for the secured amount shall be fixed by the
financing party in conjunction with EIC, acting on behalf of the Town of
New Castle, as provided in the finance agreement.
A. Upon the making of the loan pursuant to the finance agreement, the
secured amount shall become a special benefit assessment lien on the
benefited property in favor of the Town of New Castle. The amount of
the benefit assessment lien shall be the secured amount Evidence of the
benefit assessment lien shall be recorded by EIC, on behalf of the Town
of New Castle, in the land records for properties in the Town of New
Castle. Such recording shall be exempt from any charge, mortgage
recording tax or other fee in the same manner as if recorded by the
Town of New Castle. The benefit assessment lien shall not be foreclosed
upon by or otherwise enforced by the Town of New Castle.
B. The finance agreement shall provide for the repayment of the secured
amount in installments made at least annually, as provided in a
schedule attached to the benefit assessment lien (the "annual
installment amount"). The annual installment amount shall be levied by
EIC, on behalf of the Town of New Castle, on the benefited property in
the same manner as other levies for municipal charges, shall become a
lien on the benefited property as of the first day of January of the fiscal
year for which levied (the "annual installment lien") and shall remain a
lien until paid. The creation or any recording of the annual installment
lien shall be exempt from any charge, mortgage recording tax or other
fee in the same manner as if recorded by the Town of New Castle.
Payment to the financing party shall be considered payment for this
purpose. Such payment shall partly or wholly discharge the annual
installment lien. Delinquent annual installment amounts may accrue
financing charges as may be provided in the finance agreement. Any
§ 63-7 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 63-8
1:450
additional financing charges imposed by the financing party pursuant
to the finance agreement shall increase the annual installment amount
and the annual installment lien for the year in which such overdue
payments were first due.
C. The benefit assessment lien shall be reduced annually by the amount of
each annual installment lien when each annual installment lien
becomes a lien. Each annual installment lien shall be subordinate to all
Municipal Liens, whether created by Section 902 of the RPTL or by any
other state or local law. No portion of a secured amount shall be
recovered by the Town of New Castle, EIC or an assignee upon
foreclosure, sale or other disposition of the benefited property unless
and until all municipal liens are fully discharged. Each annual
installment lien, however, shall have priority over all nonmunicipal
liens, irrespective of when created, except as otherwise required by
law.
D. Neither the benefit assessment lien nor any annual installment lien
shall be extinguished or accelerated in the event of a default or
bankruptcy of the benefited property owner. Each annual installment
amount shall be considered a charge upon the benefited property and
shall be collected by EIC, on behalf of the Town of New Castle, at the
same time and in the same manner as real property taxes or municipal
charges. Each annual installment lien shall remain a lien until paid.
Amounts collected in respect of an annual installment lien shall be
remitted to EIC, on behalf of the Town of New Castle, or the financing
party, as may be provided in the finance agreement.
E. EIC shall act as the Town of New Castle's agent in collection of the
annual installment amounts. If any benefited property owner fails to
pay an annual installment amount, the financing party may redeem the
benefited property by paying the amount of all unpaid municipal liens
thereon, and thereafter shall have the right to collect any amounts in
respect of an annual installment lien by foreclosure or any other
remedy available at law. Any foreclosure shall not affect any subsequent
annual installment liens.
F. EIC, on behalf of the Town of New Castle, may sell or assign for
consideration any and all benefit assessment liens and annual
installment liens to financing parties that provide financing to qualified
properties pursuant to finance agreements. The financing parties may
sell or assign for consideration any and all benefit assessment liens and
annual installment liens received from EIC, on behalf of the Town of
New Castle, subject to certain conditions provided in the administration
agreement between EIC and the financing party. The assignee or
assignees of such benefit assessment liens and annual installment liens
shall have and possess the same powers and rights at law or in equity as
the Town of New Castle would have had if the benefit assessment lien
and the annual installment liens had not been assigned with regard to
the precedence and priority of such lien, the accrual of interest and the
fees and expenses of collection.
§ 63-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 63-9
1:451
§ 63-9. Verification and report.
EIC, on behalf of the Town of New Castle, shall verify and report on
the installation and performance of renewable energy systems and energy
efficiency improvements financed by the program in such form and manner
as the authority may establish.

§ 64-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Environmental
Protection Overlay Regulations Local Law of the Town of New Castle."
§ 64-2. Background and findings.
A. The rural character of the Town of New Castle is most evident in both
the eastern and western ends of the Town, where much of the land
remains undeveloped and forested. Many of the undeveloped tracts of
land have physical characteristics such as wetlands, steep slopes, and
poor drainage, that make the areas both difficult to develop and
environmentally sensitive. The scenic roadways and ridgeline views
within these areas offer immeasurable visual enjoyment. A trail network
plan is being developed to promote recreational opportunities by
linking many of these open space parcels with other existing public
open spaces. The unique environmental attributes present at both ends
of the Town contribute greatly to the community character that helps
define New Castle.
B. One of the Town's primary goals is to provide greater protection for the
region's water resources. The overlay district to be established for the
eastern end of Town is entirely located in the Croton and Kensico
Watersheds, part of the New York City water supply system. The overlay
district to be established for the western end of the Town contains the
majority of watershed lands that surround the Indian Brook Reservoir -
the principal drinking water source for the Village and Town of
Ossining. In addition, the western end of the Town drains into the
Hudson River watershed, a major recreational and important fisheries
resource for the region.
§ 63-9 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 64-2
1:452
§ 64-3. Purpose.
C. The eastern and western ends of the Town contain a significant amount
of wetland resources. Nine of the 18 New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation designated wetlands within New Castle
are located within the Environmental Protection Overlay Districts to be
established for the eastern and western ends of the Town. Of particular
significance is that the state wetlands at both ends of the Town form
extensive linear corridors that are connected hydrologically via
watercourses and often are flanked by steep slopes. A substantial
percentage of the properties in both the eastern and western ends of
the Town contain state and locally designated wetlands, as well as
slopes in the 15  25% range. The unique combination of steep slopes
and adjacent wetland systems contribute greatly to the environmental
sensitivity of both ends of the Town. The Town Board finds that
preservation, protection and conservation of these resources is a public
policy of the Town.
A. In order to protect, maintain and enhance both the immediate and longterm
health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the Town of
New Castle, the Environmental Protection Overlay Regulations impose
special controls over land development located in areas that have been
determined to be environmentally sensitive within the Town of New
Castle. These regulations are designed to enhance the preservation and
protection of wetlands located within the Town as invaluable natural
resources that provide for flood protection, wildlife habitat, recreation
and open space, erosion and pollution control, and recharging of
ground water supplies by:
(1) Increasing the size of protected wetland buffers, which play a
critical role in maintaining water quality functions, providing
important transitional habitat for wildlife, and filtering out nonpoint
pollution sources. The proximity of wetlands to steep slopes
makes protection of the buffer area even more critical due to the
underlying soils that may exhibit severe soil erosion
characteristics, increased runoff potential, and the need for greater
undisturbed distances up-slope to support resident endemic
wildlife populations.
(2) Regulating small wetland areas below 1/10th of an acre that may
play a critical role in providing the only available habitat for
environmentally sensitive species that depend upon wetlands for
part of their life cycle, especially vernal areas that tend to be very
small, often isolated, and seasonal, wetland habitats.
(3) Adopting a specific wetlands assessment model for performing
wetlands functional analyses for all development projects that
involve wetland impacts in order to protect and safeguard the
values and functions of the wetland systems and provide
consistency in review methods and analysis. The eastern and
western ends of the Town consist of extensive linear wetland

Words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted as defined below,
and where ambiguity exists, words or phrases shall be interpreted so as
to carry out the regulatory goals and purposes stated in § 64-2 and § 64-3
hereof. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
APPLICANT  A person requesting a land use or environmental permit or
approval or a person to whom such a permit or approval has been given.
APPROVING AUTHORITY  The board, individual or entity invested with
authority to grant or deny a land use or environmental permit or approval
under the applicable provisions of the Town Code relating to such land use
or environmental permit or approval.
DEVELOPMENT  Any construction or expansion of a building, structure
or use, any change in use of a building, structure, driveway, road or any
complexes that are connected hydrologically. Impacts from
development of specific areas within these wetlands systems can
create a cumulative impact on wetland functions. Applying a
specific model will allow consistency of review and enable crossreferencing
of cumulative impacts to wetland functions.
(4) Restricting the number of wetland crossings to reduce the amount
of disturbance directly within a wetland and/or watercourse,
preserve the linear corridors and riparian habitat for wildlife
movement, eliminate the creation of additional impervious
surfaces, reduce the amount of fragmentation of riparian habitat,
and reduce the amount of non-point pollution from entering into
the wetland system.
(5) Promoting more effective planning of lot layout and design, with
consequent benefits to the protection of the Town's wetland
resources, by requiring that wetland buffers be deducted in the
computation of the required net dry area of a lot.
(6) Requiring a 2:1 mitigation replacement ratio for wetland and
wetland buffer impacts caused by development in order to
maximize the protection and functions provided by the remaining
wetland resources.
B. The regulations contained herein are not intended to be substituted for
other general zoning district provisions, but are to be superimposed
over such district provisions as additional requirements to be met by
the applicant prior to project approval. The intent of the Environmental
Protection Overlay Regulations is to provide the Town with an
additional level of review and regulation that controls how land
development permitted by the Town's primary zoning districts should
occur in sensitive or unique environmental areas.
§ 64-3 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 64-4

other changes in the use of land that require a land use or environmental
permit or approval.
LAND USE OR ENVIRONMENTAL PERMIT OR APPROVAL  A permit
or approval issued pursuant to Chapter 60 (Zoning), Chapter 108 (Steep
Slope Protection), Chapter 113 (Subdivision of Land), Chapter 121 (Tree
Preservation) or Chapter 137 (Wetlands) of the Town Code.
MITIGATION PLAN  A plan prepared by an applicant which shall specify
mitigation measures that provide for replacement wetlands and wetlands
buffers that recreate as nearly as possible the original wetlands and
wetlands buffers in terms of type, function, geographic location and setting.
PERSON  Any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation,
company, organization or legal entity of any kind, including public agencies
and municipal corporations.
TOWN  The Town of New Castle, New York.
TOWN BOARD  The Town Board of the Town of New Castle, New York.
WATERCOURSE  Any natural or artificial, permanent or intermittent,
public or private surface water body or surface water segment, such as
ponds, lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams, brooks or waterways, that are
contained within, flow through or border on the Town of New Castle.
WETLANDS: 
WETLANDS BUFFER  A specified area surrounding a wetlands that is
intended to provide protection to the wetlands from human activity and
other encroachment associated with development. The wetlands buffer shall
be determined to be the area extending 150 feet horizontally away from and
paralleling the wetlands boundary.
§ 64-5. Applicability of regulations.
All areas that comprise hydric soils and/or are inundated or saturated
by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to
support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence
of hydrophytic vegetation as defined by the Federal Interagency
Committee for Wetlands Delineation 1989; Federal Manual for
Identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands; United States Army

B. Watercourses as defined in this chapter.
A. This chapter establishes procedures, requirements, standards and
criteria that apply to the development of any lot or part thereof which is
in whole or in part contained within the boundaries of an Environmental
Protection Overlay District. The procedures, requirements, standards
and criteria shall apply only to that portion of the subject property
within the boundaries of such District.
§ 64-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 64-5
1:455
§ 64-6. Procedures; approving authority.
§ 64-7. Scope of controls.
B. Compliance with these procedures, requirements, standards and
criteria is required in addition to compliance with all zoning, land use
and environmental regulations otherwise applicable to development
within the underlying zoning districts, including but not limited to
Chapter 60 (Zoning), Chapter 108 (Steep Slope Protection), Chapter
113 (Subdivision of Land), Chapter 121 (Tree Preservation), and
Chapter 137 (Wetlands).
C. The uses of land and structures which are allowed in the Environmental
Protection Overlay Districts, and the bulk and parking requirements
attendant thereto, are as provided by the applicable underlying zoning
districts, subject to compliance with the procedures, requirements,
standards and criteria contained within this chapter.
A. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, applications for any land
use or environmental permit or approval for the development of any
property wholly or partially within an Environmental Protection Overlay
District shall be processed in accordance with the procedures
established under the existing provisions of the Town Code governing
such permit or approval.
B. The approving authority for such environmental or land use permit or
approval shall continue to be as provided under the existing provisions
of the Town Code governing such permit or approval.
C. In connection with the granting of a land use or environmental permit
or approval for development in an Environmental Protection Overlay
District, the approving authority may attach such conditions as are
deemed necessary to ensure the preservation and protection of
environmentally sensitive areas and to ensure compliance with the
policies and provisions of this chapter.
A. Wetlands. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of Chapters 60 or
137 of the Town Code, the following regulations shall apply to all
proposed development within an Environmental Protection Overlay
District:
(1) All wetlands, regardless of size, shall be subject to regulation under
the provisions of Chapter 137 of the Town Code and this chapter.
(2) For purposes of applying the provisions of this chapter and Chapter
137 of the Town Code, the wetlands buffer shall be determined to
be the area extending 150 feet horizontally away from and
paralleling the wetlands boundary.
(3) Development in a wetlands or wetlands buffer is to be avoided
except where no reasonable alternative exists or where the
applicant would otherwise suffer undue hardship if a permit is not
§ 64-5 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 64-7
1:456
issued. In the event such development is approved, the impacts
thereof to the wetlands or wetlands buffer shall be minimized to
the greatest extent practicable, and a mitigation plan as described
in Subsection A(6) hereof shall be required.
(4) All applications for wetland permits shall be accompanied by a
wetland functional analysis prepared by a professional wetlands
scientist or other qualified wetlands professional using the
following wetland assessment model: "A Rapid Procedure for
Assessing Wetland Functional Capacity" by D. Magee and G.
Hollands, 1998.
(5) Except for a single crossing of a watercourse or a wetland area
required to provide primary access to a property, crossing of
watercourses and/or wetlands is prohibited. Where undue hardship
would result from strict compliance with the provisions of this
section, the approving authority may permit one or more additional
crossings based on the circumstances of a particular case and the
relative functions and values of the affected wetlands. In the event
any crossings of a wetland area are approved, the impacts thereof
to the wetlands or wetlands buffer shall be minimized to the
greatest extent practicable and a mitigation plan as described in
Subsection A(6) hereof shall be required.
(6) As a condition of the granting of any wetlands permit within an
Environmental Protection Overlay District, the approving authority
shall require that the applicant submit a mitigation plan pursuant
to § 137-6 of the Town Code. As part of that mitigation plan, the
applicant shall be required to create replacement wetlands or
restore, recreate or enhance existing wetlands or wetland buffers
equal to twice the area of wetland or wetland buffer directly
impacted. However, the approving authority, in its discretion, may
modify this 2:1 mitigation replacement ratio based upon special
circumstances of a particular case and the relative functions and
values of the affected wetland as detailed in the wetlands
functional analysis prepared by the applicant for the property, or
otherwise where undue hardship would result from strict
compliance with the provisions of this subsection.
(7) For purposes of computing the net dry area for a lot in an
Environmental Protection Overlay District pursuant to
§ 60-420A(6) of the Town Code, no more than 10% of the minimum
area requirement of a lot may be fulfilled by land which is under
water, subject to flooding, classified as a floodway under Chapter
70 (Flood Damage Prevention) of the Town Code or classified as a
wetland or wetland buffer under the provisions of this chapter or
Chapter 137 of the Town Code. [Amended 10-22-2013 by L.L.

as a condition of approval that structures and activities on the
property be set back more than 150 feet from the boundary of
a wetland where the approving authority determines that such
additional setback is required to accomplish the purposes set forth
in § 64-3A(1) hereof, notwithstanding the fact that no wetlands
permit is required for such structure or activity.
A. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to activities and
structures lawfully undertaken or constructed on lots within an
Environmental Protection Overlay District prior to the effective date of
this chapter.
B. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to any development,
alteration or improvement of property located within an Environmental
Protection Overlay District for which final approval has been obtained

FILMING
§ 65-1. Findings; purpose.
The Town Board finds that filming, as defined herein, in the Town of New
Castle is a desirable practice that encourages artistic development, local
economy and tourism. Nevertheless, the Town Board also finds that filming
on private and public property in the Town may create significant hardship,
inconvenience, danger and discomfort to the general public and residents
of the Town of New Castle caused by temporary adverse impacts, including
traffic, noise, lights, vibrations, odors, etc. By reason of the foregoing, the
Town Board finds the the health, welfare and safety will be served by
adoption of a local law providing a means or regulating, by license, the
undertaking of any filming on private or public property within the Town of
New Castle. The Town Board does hereby ordain and enact this chapter to
accomplish the aforesaid purposes. The existing policy of the Town of New
Castle concerning filming, adopted February 14, 1989, is hereby repealed,
revoked and superseded in its entirety.

Administration
§ 70-10. Designation of local administrator.
The Building Inspector, in consultation with the Town Engineer, is hereby
appointed local administrator to administer and implement this chapter by
granting or denying floodplain development permits in accordance with its
provisions.
§ 70-11. Purpose of floodplain development permit; fees.
§ 70-12. Permit application.
The applicant shall provide the following information as appropriate;
additional information may be required on the permit application form:
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of protecting its
citizens from increased flood hazards and ensuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 70-6, without a valid floodplain development permit.
Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the local
administrator and may include but not be limited to plans, in duplicate,
drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions and
elevations of the area in question, existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials, drainage facilities and the location of the
foregoing. All permit applications and all documents accompanying the
application shall also be submitted in an electronic file format.
[Amended 3-27-2012 by L.L. No. 1-2012]
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee as set forth in the Master Fee
Schedule, which may be amended. In addition, the applicant shall be
responsible for reimbursing the Town of New Castle for any additional
costs necessary for review, inspection and approval of this project. The
local administrator may require a deposit of no more than $500 to cover
these additional costs.
A. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially improved
structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH or Zone A if base
flood elevation data is available. Upon completion of the lowest floor,
the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
elevation, certified by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor.
B. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any new
or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be floodproofed.
§ 70-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 70-12
1:479
§ 70-13. Powers and duties of local administrator.
Duties of the local administrator shall include but not be limited to the
following:
Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the structure, the
permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer or surveyor.
C. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 70-15C.
D. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing
criteria in § 70-17.
E. A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by a
licensed professional engineer must be submitted that demonstrate
that the altered or relocated segment will provide equal or greater
conveyance than the original stream segment. The applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the
documents enumerated in § 70-6, when notified by the local
administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the
conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be
maintained.
F. A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required by
the local administrator, which shows whether proposed development to
be located in an area of special flood hazard may result in physical
damage to any other property.
G. In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data is available from other
sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit
applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home and recreational vehicle
parks and subdivisions) that are greater than either 50 lots or five
acres.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 70-12 and for compliance with the provisions and
standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
§ 70-12 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 70-13
1:480
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of Article V, and, in particular, § 70-14A.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
Article V, no permit shall be issued. The applicant may revise the
application to include measures that mitigate or eliminate the
adverse effects and resubmit the application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.
(1) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated
areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 70-12G, as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data is not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
(1) Notify adjacent communities and the New York State Department
of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of such
notification to the Regional Director, Region II, Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage. The local administrator shall:
§ 70-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 70-13
1:481

elevation data is available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
structure, obtain from the permit holder a certification of the asbuilt
elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation in
relation to mean sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by or
under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by the same. For manufactured
homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation
upon placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of
elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it
remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is
fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue or cause to be issued a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 70-8 of this chapter.
(2) The local administrator shall issue or cause to be issued a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found noncompliant
with the provisions of this chapter and/or the conditions of the

appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals, shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program of that area.
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search-and-rescue operations during periods of
flooding.
§ 70-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 70-19
1:491
§ 70-20. Conditions for variances.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search-and-rescue operations and
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D and the purposes of
this chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose
of this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that the items in
§ 70-19D(1) through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met.
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
§ 70-19 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 70-20
1:492
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense; create nuisances; cause fraud on or
victimization of the public; or conflict with existing chapters,
ordinances or the Town Code.
G. Notification.
(1) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
(a) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage; and
(b) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property.
(2) Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance
actions as required in § 70-13H of this chapter.

against his property or the failure to grant a senior citizen exemption
may file a complaint with the Town Assessor for review and
determination by the Board of Assessment Review in accordance with
the procedures applicable to other assessment complaints as provided
in Title 1-A of the Real Property Tax Law,67 as same may be amended
from time to time.
B. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A hereof, any such
grievance complaint with regard to the 1987 assessment roll for the
New Castle Residential Refuse and Garbage District shall be filed with
the Town Assessor on or before December 15, 1987. A special meeting
of the Board of Assessment Review shall be held at a time and place to
be duly posted and published at least five days before said meeting.
Such posting shall include at least a notice posted at Town Hall, the
Community Center and the Chappaqua Library and published once in a
newspaper with a circulation in the Town of New Castle.

A. The Town hereby adopts the USGBC's LEED for New Construction
(LEED-NC) Rating System, Version 3.0. The Town Clerk shall maintain
copies of the current green building standards in effect under this
chapter and any additional documents necessary for applicants to
comply with the standards of this chapter.
B. Because green building standards are highly technical and the Building
Inspector has the proper expertise to determine whether new standards
are appropriate, he or she shall be in charge of adopting new LEED or
§ 74-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 74-4
1:511
§ 74-5. Standards for compliance.
ENERGY STAR® rating systems, new versions of LEED or ENERGY
STAR®, a green construction code, or a different green building rating
system. Whenever the Building Inspector considers adopting a new
system, version, or code, he or she shall follow the process below.
(1) The Building Inspector shall determine whether or not to adopt the
new rating system, version, or code based on the following
standards:
(a) The new rating system, version, or code must have been
established by a government agency or by a not for profit
organization whose standards have achieved widespread
acceptance;
(b) The new rating system, version, or code, looked at as a whole,
must be no less protective of the environment than the prior
rating system, version, or code;
(c) The new rating system, version, or code must be designed to
reflect recent scientific, engineering, and technological
knowledge;
(d) The new rating system, version, or code cannot be adopted
primarily for the benefit of a particular project or applicant;
and
(e) The new rating system has been determined by the Town
Counsel to be consistent with applicable law.
(2) If the Building Inspector decides to adopt the new rating system,
version, or code, he or she must make public this adoption by filing
the adoption with the Town Clerk and giving public notice of the
adoption in the manner customary for the Town. The new rating
system, version, or code shall not apply to any new buildings for
which a building permit had already been issued at the time that
such filing and notice have been effectuated.
(3) Nothing in this section shall abrogate the authority of the Town
Board to adopt, modify, or repeal green building standards that
have been adopted by the Building Inspector.
C. If a different green building rating system other than LEED or ENERGY
STAR® is adopted pursuant to Subsection B, the other provisions of this
chapter are deemed modified to conform thereto.
A. All new construction of covered buildings must comply with the
following standards:
(1) All municipal buildings greater than 5,000 square feet of
conditioned space must be at least LEED Silver certifiable.
§ 74-4 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 74-5
1:512
§ 74-6. Compliance process.
(2) All commercial and high-rise multifamily residential buildings
greater than 5,000 square feet of conditioned space must be at
least LEED Silver certifiable.
(3) All new construction of covered commercial, high-rise multifamily
residential and municipal buildings must attain at least four points
from the Energy and Atmosphere Credit 1 of the LEED-NC
checklist.
B. All major renovations to covered buildings (municipal, commercial and
high-rise multifamily residential buildings greater than 5,000 square
feet of conditioned space) must comply with the following standards.
(1) Any new boiler, furnace, hot water heater, and central airconditioning
unit installed in a covered building undergoing a
major renovation must be ENERGY STAR® compliant.
(2) Attain at least four points from the Energy and Atmosphere Credit
1 of the LEED-NC checklist.
C. Applicants for covered buildings are not required to attain LEED
certification from the USGBC nor are they required to share energy and
water usage data with USGBC under LEED's minimum program
requirements.
A. New construction and major modifications.
(1) Applications. Every applicant who files a building permit
application for new construction of or major modification to a
covered building must submit to the Building Inspector:
(a) A completed LEED checklist demonstrating the LEED points a
building is designed to obtain.
(b) A written explanation of how the building will obtain the LEED
points identified in the checklist.
(c) Design plans that demonstrate compliance with the applicable
standard required by § 74-5 of this chapter.
(d) Any other documents or information the Building Inspector
finds necessary to decide whether the building will achieve the
applicable standard required by § 74-5 of this chapter.
(e) An application fee to cover the cost of Town and third-party
inspection services. The application fee will be established by
the Town Board and published in the annual fee schedule and
will be graduated depending on the size of the building. The
Town has the right to obtain an additional fee from the
applicant if the application fee does not cover the full cost of
the Town and third-party inspection services. Any unused
§ 74-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 74-6
1:513
§ 74-7. Enforcement.
portion of this fee will be returned once the building attains
the required rating as set forth in § 74-5A or the application is
withdrawn.
(f) If the applicant can show a clear and specific inconsistency
between meeting a state or federal legal requirement and the
attainment of one or more particular LEED points, or that
antitrust laws prevent the municipality from requiring a
particular LEED point or set of points, either of which could
invalidate this chapter or a provision thereof, the applicant
should document the conflict in the application. The Building
Inspector shall review the documentation in consultation with
the Town's legal counsel and if such inconsistency exists, will
deem the LEED point to have been achieved by the building if
otherwise applicable building and energy conservation code
requirements have been met.
(2) Approval. No building permit shall be issued for any covered
building unless the Building Inspector determines the application
demonstrates that the covered building will attain the applicable
standard as required by § 74-5 of this chapter.
(3) Nonapproval. If the Building Inspector determines that the
documentation is incomplete or indicates that the covered building
will not meet the required standard in § 74-5 of this chapter, the
Building Inspector shall either:
(a) Return the documentation to the applicant marked "denied,"
including a statement of reasons for the denial; or
(b) Return the documentation to the applicant marked "further
explanation required," and detail the additional information
needed.
(4) Resubmission. If the documentation is returned to the applicant,
the applicant may resubmit the documentation with such additional
information as may be required or may apply for a partial
exemption under § 74-8 of this chapter.
(5) Decisions by the Building Inspector. All decisions by the Building
Inspector, including but not limited to approval or nonapproval of
applications for a building permit, issuance of a stop-work order,
substitution of LEED points or ENERGY STAR® features, and
temporary approval and mitigation measures, shall be in writing.
These decisions will be provided to the affected applicants. Copies
will be retained by the Town and made available for public
inspection.
A. Compliance review. The Building Inspector shall determine whether the
specifications identified in the documentation provided pursuant to
§ 74-6 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 74-7
1:514
§ 74-6A have been implemented by conducting inspections at any time
during construction or until the issuance of a final certificate of
occupancy. The applicant shall provide the Building Inspector with
access to the premises in order to conduct inspections to ensure
compliance with this chapter. The Town may require the applicant
to provide information and documents showing use of products,
equipment, and materials specified in the documentation provided
pursuant to § 74-6A. If the Town determines that the building is not
being constructed in accordance with the documentation, the Building
Inspector may issue a stop-work order. This order may apply to a
portion of the building or to the entire building and shall remain in
effect until the Building Inspector determines that the building will be
brought into compliance with the documentation and the requirements
of this chapter.
B. Inspection services. The Building Inspector may contract with a
qualified individual or entity to perform inspection services to advise
with respect to whether an applicant has met the requirements of this
chapter. The inspection reports and recommendations issued by such
individual or entity will be reviewed by the Building Inspector, who will
decide whether to accept, reject or modify them. The Building Inspector
may enter into an agreement with one or more municipalities to retain
the services of an individual or entity to perform such services. The cost
of these services will be borne by the applicant through application fees
as set forth in § 74-6A(1)(c).
C. Substitution of LEED points or ENERGY STAR® features. During
compliance review, the Building Inspector may exercise flexibility to
substitute the approved LEED points with other LEED points or to
substitute approved ENERGY STAR® features with other ENERGY
STAR® features so long as the building will still attain the green
building rating required by this chapter. Substitution shall occur only at
the request of the applicant and when it is determined by the Building
Inspector that the originally approved points or features are no longer
feasible or that the substitute point or feature will realize a more
favorable result as determined by the Building Inspector. Substitution is
at the discretion of the Building Inspector.
D. Final approval. The Town Building Department shall not issue a final
certificate of use and occupancy for any construction of a covered
building unless it finds that the building has achieved the standard
required under § 74-5 of this chapter.

denial of an exemption or compliance with the chapter, to the Town Zoning
Board of Appeals. Any appeal must be filed with the secretary of the Town
Zoning Board of Appeals not more than 60 days after the decision or
determination by the Building Inspector is furnished to the applicant. The
appeal shall state the alleged error or reason for the appeal. The Town
Zoning Board of Appeals shall review the decision or determination under
the same standard of review it would generally use in its appellate capacity
and may uphold, reverse or modify the decision or determination, or refer
the matter back to the Building Inspector for such further action as may
be directed by the Town Zoning Board of Appeals. The Town Zoning Board
of Appeals may not grant variances from the technical requirements of the
applicable rating system, version, or code, but it may review the Building
Inspector's interpretation of such requirements.

formalities have been complied with and that the work has been done
properly and satisfactorily, and shall be full notice to every person
concerned that the amount of the statement, plus interest, constitutes a
charge against the property designated or described in the statement
and that the same is due and collectible as provided by law. The remedy
herein shall not be exclusive and any other action to collect said sum
due may be maintained by the town.

A. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or
portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional
by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a
separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not
affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof.
B. Title. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Town of
New Castle Litter Law."
C. Ordinances repealed. All ordinances or local laws and parts of
ordinances or local laws in conflict with the provisions of this chapter
are hereby repealed.
A. Findings. The Town Board of the Town of New Castle hereby finds that:
(1) The uncontrolled placement and lack of maintenance of newsracks
in public rights-of-way present an inconvenience and danger to the
safety and welfare of persons using such rights-of-way, including
§ 85-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 87-1
1:533
pedestrians, persons entering and leaving vehicles and buildings,
and persons performing essential utility, traffic control and
emergency services.
(2) Unsightly newsracks and newsracks located so as to obstruct
walkways or crosswalks or to endanger persons using public rightsof-
way constitute public nuisances.
(3) The existence of these factors constitutes an unreasonable
interference with and obstruction of the use of public rights-of-way;
a potentially dangerous condition; an offense to the senses; and an
obstruction of the free use of property as to interfere with the
comfortable enjoyment of life and property by the entire
community.
(4) The Town Board recognizes, however, that the use of such rights-ofway
is historically associated with the sale and distribution of
newspapers and publications and that access to those areas for
such purposes should not be absolutely denied. The Town Board
further finds that these strong and competing interests require a
reasonable accommodation which can be achieved satisfactorily
only through the means of this chapter, which is designed to
accommodate such interests regulating the place and manner of
using such newsracks.
B. Purpose. The provisions and prohibitions of this chapter have the
purpose of securing and promoting the public health, safety and
general welfare of persons in the Town in their use of public rights-ofway
through the regulation of placement, appearance, number, size and
servicing of newsracks on the public rights-of-way so as to:
(1) Provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience.
(2) Ensure no unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian or
vehicular traffic, including ingress to, or egress from, any place of
business or from the street to the sidewalk, or access to drop curb
cuts.
(3) Provide reasonable access for the use and maintenance of
sidewalks, poles, posts, traffic signs, hydrants and similar
appurtenances.
(4) Reduce visual blight on the public rights-of-way; protect the
aesthetics and value of surrounding properties.
(5) Reduce exposure of the Town to personal injury or property
damage claims and litigation.
(6) Protect the right to distribute information protected by the United
States and New York State Constitutions through use of newsracks.
C. Preservation of constitutional rights. It is not the intent of this chapter
to, in any way, discriminate against, regulate or interfere with the

Real Property Assessment of Converted Condominium Units
[Adopted 10-9-2018 by L.L. No. 12-2018]
§ 95-8. Legislative findings; opt out.
A. The Town Board hereby finds that residential condominium units obtain
a favorable advantage, from a real property tax assessment
perspective, as compared to residential tax parcels (including those
improved with single-family homes) that are held in conventional forms
of property ownership. This advantage stems from statutorily
prescribed methods of assessment dictated under of § 581, Subdivision
1(a), of the New York Real Property Tax Law and § 339-y, Subdivision
1(b), of the New York Real Property Law.
B. The Town Board also recognizes that § 581, Subdivision 1(c), of the New
York Real Property Tax Law and § 339-y, Subdivision 1(f), of the New
York Real Property Law allow a taxing jurisdiction to "opt out" of these
statutory valuation requirements with regard to properties that convert
from conventional form of ownership to condominium ownership, and
that such an "opt out" may be effected through the enactment of a local
law.

§ 100-1. Legislative intent.
A. The Town Board hereby finds and determines that the Town of New
Castle has a substantial interest in reducing the number of individuals
of all ages who use cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine products,
and a particular interest in protecting adolescents from tobacco
dependence and the illnesses and premature death associated with
tobacco and nicotine use. Tobacco companies sell products that are
addictive and inherently dangerous, causing cancer, heart disease, and
other serious illnesses. Primary tobacco use is a major cause of
mortality and morbidity, directly causing an estimated 480,000 deaths
per year in the United States, more deaths than are caused by the use of
any other legal or illegal substance or drug. An overwhelming majority
of Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products
while they are adolescents and become addicted before reaching the
age of 18. The Surgeon General of the United States has concluded that
if young people do not start using tobacco by age 26, they almost
certainly will never start. The effects of smoking generated by the
smoking of cigars, cigarettes, pipes, and similar articles pose a threat to
the health, safety and well-being of youth within the Town of New
Castle. Therefore, it is the intent of the Town of New Castle to reduce
youth smoking rate by prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to
persons under the age of 21.
B. The Town Board further finds that the Town has a substantial interest in
responding to the increased use of electronic cigarettes and nicotine
delivery products among adolescents. E-cigarettes are now the most
commonly used tobacco product among youth, having surpassed

§ 106-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Solid Waste Disposal Law."
§ 106-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the disposal of all solid waste
generated in the town in compliance with federal and state standards for
the control of air, water and ground pollution through participation in
the Plan for Solid Waste Management in Westchester County, New York,
dated May 7, 1974, adopted by Westchester County Board of Legislators by
Resolution No. 162-1974, as provided herein.
§ 106-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
PLAN  A Plan for Solid Waste Management in Westchester County, New
York, dated May 7, 1974.
SOLID WASTE  Includes all manner of useless or unwanted or discharged
solid or semisolid nontoxic, domestic, commercial, industrial, institutional,
construction and demolition waste materials, except hazardous, toxic,
chemical, human or rendering wastes.
SOLID WASTE FACILITY  Includes any fixed facility that is established,
maintained and operated, either as its primary function or in support of
some other facility or operation, for the transfer, treatment, disposal or
salvage of solid waste. It includes, but is not limited to, any facility that
is established for the purpose of transferring, bailing, composting,
incinerating, recycling, separating, salvaging, shredding or landfilling any
solid waste or any combination of functions thereof, including stationary
compactors located at points of collection.
§ 104-11 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 106-4

§ 106-4. Transfer of solid waste.
The town shall deliver or cause to be delivered to a solid waste facility
or facilities designated by Westchester County, and licensed, operated or
approved by Westchester County, all solid waste collected or caused to be
collected within the boundaries of the town, subject to such restrictions as
may be required by the county in conformity with the plan as set forth in
Resolution No. 162-1974 of the County Board of Legislators, except that
bona fide recycling or resource recovery programs or drives within this
municipality and operated or licensed by it may be exempted from this
section with the approval of Westchester County.
§ 106-5. Payment of fees.
Recognizing that the plan offers the most efficient and least costly method
of solid waste disposal in compliance with federal and state standards for
the control of air, ground and water pollution, the town agrees to pay all
reasonable fees set by Westchester County for the disposal of solid waste,
presently estimated to be about $15 per ton at the designated point of
transfer to the county facility.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 108-1. Purpose; findings.
The Town Board of the Town of New Castle finds and declares it to be the
public policy of the Town to preserve, protect and conserve its steep slopes
so as to maintain and protect the natural terrain and its vegetative features,
preserve wetlands, water bodies and watercourses, prevent flooding,
protect important scenic views and vistas, preserve areas of wildlife habitat,
provide safe building sites and protect adjoining property by preventing
surface erosion, creep and sudden slope failure. In this connection, the
Town Board finds as follows:
A. Protection of steep slopes is a matter of concern to the entire town. The
establishment of regulatory and conservation practices to prevent
disturbance of steep slopes is needed to protect the public health,
safety and general welfare. Experience has demonstrated a need for
effective protection of steep slopes, including careful review and
regulation and the implementation of stringent mitigation measures
where, in the opinion of the approving authority, no practicable
alternative to such disturbance exists. However, in all cases where the
approving authority determines that total avoidance of steep slopes is
not practicable, such disturbance should constitute the minimum
disturbance necessary to ensure the property owner a reasonable use
of his property.
B. The improperly managed disturbance of steep slopes can aggravate
erosion and sedimentation beyond rates experienced in natural
geomorphological processes. Erosion and sedimentation often include
the loss of topsoil, a valuable natural resource, and can result in the
disturbance of habitats, degradation of the quality of surface water,
alteration of drainage patterns, the gullying of land, obstruction of
drainage structures and intensification of flooding both on and off the
subject site.
C. The inadequately controlled disturbance of steep slopes can lead to the
failure of slopes and the mass movement of earth; danger to the natural
environment, man-made structures and the safety of persons; and the
degradation of aesthetics.
D. Steep slopes, including vegetation and rock outcroppings located
thereon, are important environmental features that contribute
significantly to the visual impression one forms while traveling through
New Castle. Areas that are highly visible from the roadways are
particularly important in maintaining the town's semirural character.
Overdevelopment of or improperly managed disturbance to these areas
are detrimental to the visual character of the town.
E. Regulation of disturbance to steep slopes is consistent with the
legitimate interests of landowners to make reasonable use of their land.
§ 108-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 108-1
1:597
§ 108-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ANGLE OF REPOSE  The maximum angle at which the exposed face of
various soil and rock materials can deviate from the horizontal without
incurring the likelihood of a slope failure.
APPLICANT  A person requesting a steep slope permit from the Town or a
person to whom a steep slope permit has been granted in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter.
APPROVING AUTHORITY  The Town agency or public official empowered
to administer the permit procedures of this chapter, as specified in § 108-5
hereof.
BUILDING INSPECTOR  The Building Inspector of the Town of New
Castle, New York, or his authorized representative.
DISTURBANCE  The removal of vegetation, except as specifically
permitted in § 108-3B herein, or the filling, excavation, regrading or
removal of soil, rock or retaining structures in areas of steep slope, whether
by manual labor, machine or explosive. The condition of disturbance will
be deemed to continue until the area of disturbance is revegetated and/or
permanently stabilized.
DISTURBED AREA  Any steep slope area for which a disturbance is
proposed or is ongoing.
PERSON  Any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation,
company, organization or other legal entity of any kind, including public
agencies and municipal corporations.
PLANNING BOARD  The Planning Board of the Town of New Castle, New
York.
Regulation can prohibit the degradation of these important
environmental features and allow the reasonable use of private
property by encouraging flexible development design so as to avoid
disturbance of steep slopes. Regulation can also permit
environmentally sound disturbance of steep slopes conducted in
accordance with acceptable engineering practices to permit reasonable
use of private property.
F. To mitigate the potential adverse impacts of development on steep
slopes, the approving authority should seek the permanent
preservation of such areas by such means as the use of imaginative and
innovative site design, including the application of § 281 of the New
York State Town Law,71 and the establishment of conservation
easements and other land preservation techniques.

STEEP SLOPE 
STEEP SLOPE PERMIT  The written form of Town approval granted by
the approving authority and required by this chapter for the issuance of a
work permit and the conduct of any steep slope regulated activity.
Any geographical area proposed for disturbance, whether on a single
lot or not, having a topographical gradient of 15% or greater (ratio
of vertical distance to horizontal distance), with a minimum horizontal
dimension of 10 feet, and a minimum area as defined below, whether
man-made or natural, and whether created by a retaining structure or
not. Steep slopes are further categorized as:
MODERATELY STEEP SLOPE  A slope equal to or greater than
15% but less than 25% and covering a minimum horizontal area of
3/10 of an acre or 13,068 square feet.
(1)
VERY STEEP SLOPE  A slope equal to or greater than 25% but
less than 35% and covering a minimum horizontal area of 2/10 of
an acre or 8,712 square feet.
(2)
EXTREMELY STEEP SLOPE  A slope equal to or greater than
35% and covering a minimum horizontal area of 1/10 of an acre or
4,356 square feet.
(3)
A.
The most steeply sloped area that meets the minimum area threshold,
as specified above, shall determine approving authority jurisdiction and
review procedures.
B.
If the areas of proposed disturbance within each of the three categories
of steep slope are individually less than the minimum areas defined
above, then the area of all contiguous steeply sloped areas proposed
for disturbance shall be merged as specified herein. A steep slope area
shall be regulated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter if the total
of all such steeply sloped areas proposed for disturbance, as adjusted
according to the weighting factors identified below, exceeds a sum of 3/
10 of an acre or 13,068 square feet.
Moderately steep slope area X 1.0
+ Very steep slope area X 1.5
+ Extremely steep slope area X 3.0
= Total weighted area
C.
If no category of steep slope meets or exceeds the minimum area
requirement for a steep slope, but the total weighted area of two or
more slope categories exceeds 13,068 square feet (3/10 acre), then the
single slope category that has the largest area after the application
of the relevant weighting factor shall determine approving authority
jurisdiction and review procedures. All area measurements of square
feet shall be to the nearest whole number.
D.

TOWN COUNSEL  The duly appointed counsel of the Town of New Castle,
New York.
TOWN ENGINEER  The duly appointed Town Engineer of the Town of
New Castle, New York, or his duly appointed and authorized representative.
WORK PERMIT  The written approval issued by the Building Inspector
permitting the actual commencement and continuation of work within a
steep slope regulated area, consistent with the conditions, terms and
requirements of the steep slope permit issued by the approving authority.

and receive comments on such proposal.
C. During its review of the application, the approving authority will:
(1) Determine when an application is complete.
(2) Determine, in its discretion, whether the application submitted
should be referred to the Environmental Review Board for review
and report. Upon referral, the Environmental Review Board shall
report back to the approving authority within 30 days after the date
of referral or within such other period as may be specified by the
approving authority at the time of referral. Failure to comply within
the specified time period may be interpreted by the approving
authority as the Environmental Review Board's indication that it
has no objection to the application.
(3) Hold a public hearing, if required in accordance with § 108-8D
hereof.
(4) Review the application to determine that the requirements of this
chapter have been satisfied.
(5) Require posting of a guaranty bond or other security as a condition
of approval to cover losses or damages resulting from work

accordance with the requirements of this chapter. within 60 days
after the receipt of a complete application, as specified in § 108-6 of
this chapter, or after the close of a public hearing on that
application, whichever is later. Nothing in this section is to be
construed as authorization for a default approval in the event that
these periods are exceeded.
(7) Establish conditions of approval deemed necessary by the
approving authority to satisfy the goals, objectives and review
standards set forth in §§ 108-1 and 108-4 of this chapter. including
but not limited to the following:
(a) Lot layouts shall be designed so that sanitary sewage disposal
systems entirely avoid areas of very steep slope and extremely
steep slope and are in compliance with all standards and
regulations of the Westchester County Health Department.
§ 108-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 108-8
1:607
(b) The padding or terracing of building sites, including mounding
of septic tile fields, shall be minimized to the maximum extent
practicable.
(c) The alignment of roads and driveways shall follow the natural
topography, minimize regrading and comply with design
standards for maximum grades set forth in the Town Code.
(d) The natural elevations and vegetative cover of ridge lines shall
be protected from disturbance to the maximum extent
possible.
(e) All regrading shall blend in with the natural contours and
undulations of the land.
(f) Cuts and fills shall be rounded off to eliminate sharp angles at
the top, bottom and side of regraded slopes.
(g) The angle of cut and fill slopes shall not exceed the natural
angle of repose of the soil or rock materials in the cut or fill,
except where retaining walls or other structural stabilization is
used. Generally for soils, cut and fill slopes should be not
steeper than two horizontal to one vertical (50% slope).
(h) Fill slopes shall avoid all natural slopes of two horizontal to one
vertical (50% slope) or steeper. The toe of the fill slope shall not
be located within 12 feet horizontally of the top of an existing
or proposed cut slope.
(i) Tops and bottoms of cut and fill slopes shall be set back from
existing and proposed property lines a distance at least equal
to the lesser of three feet plus 1/5 of the height of the cut or fill
or 10 feet.
(j) Tops and bottoms of cut and fill slopes shall be set back from
structures a distance that will ensure the safety of the
structure in the event of the collapse of the cut or fill slopes.
Generally, such distance will be considered to be six feet plus
1/5 the height of the cut or fill but need not exceed 10 feet.
Nevertheless, a structure may be built on a slope or at the toe
of a slope if it is designed to retain the slope and to withstand
the forces exerted on it by the retained slope.
(k) The use of explosives shall be avoided to the maximum extent
practicable. Generally, disturbance of rock outcrops shall be by
means of explosives only if manual labor and machines are not
effective and only if rock blasting is conducted in accordance
with the Code of the Town of New Castle and all other
applicable regulations by a person holding a current Class A or
Class B certificate of competence from the New York State
Department of Labor.
§ 108-8 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 108-8

(l) Any disturbance of steep slopes shall be completed within one
construction season, and disturbed areas shall not be left bare
and exposed during the winter and spring thaw periods.
(m) The disturbance of existing vegetative ground cover shall not
take place more than 15 days prior to commencing grading and
construction.
(n) Temporary soil stabilization shall be applied to all areas of
disturbance and all adjoining areas within 50 feet thereof
within two days after establishing of the final grade, and
permanent stabilization and revegetation shall be undertaken
within 15 days thereafter. Upon good cause shown and based
upon consideration of the slopes, soils and environmental
sensitivity of the area involved, the Town Engineer may modify
these specified time periods.
(o) Temporary soil stabilization shall be applied within two days
after the disturbance is completed or when no additional
disturbance is to be performed for a period of seven days.
Upon good cause shown and based upon consideration of the
slopes, soils and environmental sensitivity of the area involved,
the Town Engineer may modify these specified time periods.
(p) Measure for the control of erosion and sedimentation shall be
undertaken in accordance with the Westchester County Best
Management Practices Manual for Erosion and Sediment
Control (1991), as amended, or its equivalent satisfactory to
the approving authority.
(q) Topsoil that will be stripped from all areas of disturbance shall
be stockpiled in a manner so as to minimize erosion and
sedimentation, and shall be replaced on the site at the time of
final grading.
(r) Fill material shall be composed only of nonorganic material,
including rock with a diameter that will allow for appropriate
compaction and cover by topsoil.
(s) Compaction of fill materials in fill areas shall be such that it
ensures support of proposed structures and stabilization for
intended uses.
D. Public hearings.
(1) For any application in which the approving authority is the Town

reviewed by the Town Engineer. Where the Town Engineer determines
that a substantial revision is proposed, the submission of a new
application to the approving authority shall be required.
E. The approving authority may suspend or revoke a steep slope permit in
the form of a stop-work order if it finds that the applicant has not
complied with any or all of the terms of such permit, has exceeded the
authority granted in the steep slope permit or has failed to undertake
the project in the manner set forth in such steep slope permit. The
applicant will be provided with written notice of said stop-work order as
soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than three days after
issuance of said stop-work order. Said notice shall be delivered
personally or by certified mail addressed to the applicant's address as
shown on the steep slope permit. Such applicant shall be entitled to a
hearing before the approving authority. If such a hearing is requested
by the applicant in writing within five days after the receipt of written
notice of the stop-work order, such hearing will be scheduled by the
approving authority within 15 days after receipt of the request for a

§ 108A-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Stormwater
Management and Erosion and Sediment Control Local Law of the Town of
New Castle."
§ 108A-2. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
A. Land development activities and associated increases in siteimpervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local
watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes,
flooding, stream channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and
other desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the Town;
§ 108-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 108A-2
1:615
§ 108A-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public and to address the findings
of fact in § 108A-2 hereof. This chapter seeks to meet those purposes by
achieving the following objectives:
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
(1) Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the SPDES
General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate
Stormwater Sewer Systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-02-02, or as
amended or revised;
(2) Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation
State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) General Permit
for Construction Activities GP-02-01, or as amended or revised;
(3) Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
(4) Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land
development activities which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
(5) Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to the
maximum extent practicable; and
(6) Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
practices and to ensure that these management practices are properly
maintained and eliminate threats to public safety.

§ 108A-9. Maintenance, inspection and repair of stormwater
facilities.
in accordance with these technical documents shall be presumed to
meet the standards imposed by this chapter.
(1) The "New York State Stormwater Management Design Manual"
(New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, most
recent version, including applicable updates, hereafter referred to
as the "Design Manual");
(2) "New York Standards and Specifications for Erosion and Sediment
Control", (Empire State Chapter of the Soil and Water Conservation
Society, 2005, most recent version including applicable updates,
hereafter referred to as the "Erosion Control Manual").
B. Where stormwater management practices are not in accordance with
technical standards, the applicant or developer must demonstrate
equivalence to the technical standards as set forth in § 108A-8 and the
SWPPP shall be prepared by a professional engineer or certified
professional in erosion and sediment control or in stormwater quality or
other professional deemed qualified by the Department.
C. Any land development activity shall not cause an increase in turbidity
that will result in substantial visible contrast to natural conditions in
surface waters of the state of New York.
A. The applicant or developer of the land development activity shall at all
times properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of
treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are installed
or used by the applicant or developer to achieve compliance with the
conditions of this chapter. Sediment shall be removed from sediment
traps or sediment ponds whenever their design capacity has been
reduced by 50%, and placed in an acceptable location and properly
stabilized.
B. The applicant or developer or their representative shall be on site at all
times when construction or grading activity takes place and shall
inspect and document the effectiveness of all erosion and sediment
control practices. Inspections shall be conducted and reports of those
inspections shall be completed by a professional engineer or certified
professional in erosion and sediment control or in stormwater quality or
other professional deemed qualified by the Department every seven
days and within 24 hours of any storm event producing 0.5 inch of
precipitation or more. The reports shall be maintained in a site logbook.
C. Prior to the issuance of any approval that has a stormwater
management facility other than one serving an individual single-family
residence, the applicant or developer must execute an easement that
shall be binding on all subsequent landowners served by the
stormwater management facility. The easement shall be in a form
§ 108A-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 108A-9
1:625
§ 108A-10. Erosion and sediment control inspections.
acceptable to counsel to the Town and shall provide for access to
the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the Town of
New Castle to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working
condition to meet design standards and any other provisions
established by this chapter. The easement shall be recorded by the
grantor in the office of the County Clerk after approval by the counsel
for the Town of New Castle.
D. The owner or operator of permanent stormwater management
practices installed in accordance with this chapter shall operate and
maintain the stormwater management practices to achieve the goals of
this chapter. Proper operation and maintenance also includes, as a
minimum, the following:
(1) A preventive/corrective maintenance program for all critical
facilities and systems of treatment and control (or related
appurtenances) which are installed or used by the owner or
operator to achieve the goals of this chapter.
(2) Written procedures for operation and maintenance and training
new maintenance personnel.
(3) Discharges from the SMPs shall not exceed design criteria or cause
or contribute to water quality standard violations in accordance
with § 108A-8C.
E. Prior to the issuance of any final plan approval, the applicant or
developer must execute a formal maintenance agreement for
stormwater management facilities, other than those serving an
individual single-family residence, binding on all subsequent
landowners. The maintenance agreement shall be in a form acceptable
to Town Counsel and shall be recorded in the office of the County Clerk
as a deed restriction on the property. The Town of New Castle, in lieu of
a maintenance agreement, at its sole discretion, may accept dedication
of any existing or future stormwater management facility, provided
such facility meets all the requirements of this chapter and includes
adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or
otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance.
A. The Stormwater Management Officer may require such inspections as
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter and may either
approve that portion of the work completed or notify the applicant
wherein the work fails to comply with the requirements of this chapter
and the stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as approved.
(1) To obtain inspections, the applicant shall notify Town enforcement
officials at least 48 hours before any of the following as required by
the Stormwater Management Officer:
(a) Start of construction;
§ 108A-9 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 108A-10
1:626
(b) Installation of sediment and erosion control measures;
(c) Completion of site clearing;
(d) Installation of constructed stormwater improvements;
(e) Completion of rough grading;
(f) Completion of final grading;
(g) Close of the construction season;
(h) Completion of final landscaping;
(i) Successful establishment of landscaping in public areas.
(2) If any violations are found, the applicant and developer shall be
notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required
corrective actions. No further work shall be conducted except for
site stabilization until any violations are corrected and all work
previously completed has received approval by the Stormwater
Management Officer.
B. It shall be the primary responsibility of the landowner and the
successor landowners to perform all necessary inspections,
maintenance, reporting, adjustments, repair, replacement and
reconstruction of the stormwater management facilities. If, at any time,
the Stormwater Management Officer determines that necessary
inspections, reports, maintenance, repairs, adjustments, replacement
or reconstruction have not been properly performed, the Town may
undertake to perform any such work or work that it finds, in its sole
judgment, is necessary to preserve the stormwater management
functions of stormwater management practices (SMPs), at the cost and
expense of the landowner and the successor landowners. Copies of all
bills, statements and invoices substantiating such costs, including costs
of consultants, shall be included with written notice of same. Each lot
shall individually and separately bear its equal share of such costs, and
in the event that its share is not paid within 30 days of issuance of
statements for this work, the amount of such share shall constitute a
lien against such lot, which shall be levied and collected in the same
manner as Town real estate taxes or in such manner otherwise provided
by law. The landowner and the successor lot landowner shall be
personally liable for payments of their respective shares of all such
costs, including costs of collection and reasonable attorney's fees.
C. All applicants are required to submit as-built plans for any stormwater
management practices located on site after final construction is
completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all
stormwater management facilities and must be certified by a New York
State licensed land surveyor or professional engineer.
D. Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis,
including but not limited to routine inspections; random inspections;
§ 108A-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 108A-10
1:627
§ 108A-11. Performance guarantee; recordkeeping.
inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible
violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higherthan-
typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants;
inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with higherthan-
usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges
of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause
violations of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the
SPEDES stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies
inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include
but are not limited to reviewing maintenance records; sampling
discharges, surface water, ground water, and material or water in
drainage control facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage
control facilities and other stormwater management practices.
E. The Stormwater Management Officer may require monitoring and
reporting from entities subject to this chapter as are necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter.
F. When any new stormwater management facility is installed on private
property or when any new connection is made between private property
and the public storm water system, the landowner shall grant to the
Town and other agencies having jurisdiction the right to enter the
property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the
purpose of inspection.
A. In order to ensure the full and faithful completion of all land
development activities related to compliance with all conditions set
forth by the Town in its approval of the stormwater pollution prevention
plan, the Town may require the applicant or developer to provide, prior
to construction, a performance bond, cash escrow, or irrevocable letter
of credit from an appropriate financial or surety institution which
guarantees satisfactory completion of the project and names the Town
as the beneficiary. The security shall be in an amount to be determined
by the Town based on submission of final design plans, with reference
to actual construction and landscaping costs. The performance
guarantee shall remain in force until the surety is released from liability
by the Town, provided that such period shall not be less than one year
from the date of final acceptance or such other certification that the
facility(ies) have been constructed in accordance with the approved
plans and specifications and that a one-year inspection has been
conducted and the facilities have been found to be acceptable to the
Town. Per-annum interest on cash escrow deposits shall be reinvested
in the account until the surety is released from liability.
B. Where stormwater management and erosion and sediment control
facilities are to be operated and maintained by the developer or by a
corporation that owns or manages a commercial or industrial facility,
the developer, prior to construction, may be required to provide the
Town of New Castle with an irrevocable letter of credit from an
§ 108A-10 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 108A-11
1:628
§ 108A-12. Enforcement; penalties for offenses.
approved financial institution or surety to ensure proper operation
and maintenance of all stormwater management and erosion control
facilities both during and after construction. If the developer or
landowner fails to properly operate and maintain stormwater
management and erosion and sediment control facilities, the Town may
draw upon the account to cover the costs of proper operation and
maintenance, including engineering and inspection costs.
C. Entities subject to this chapter shall maintain records demonstrating
compliance with this chapter.
A. When the Town determines that a land development activity is not
being carried out in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, it
may issue a written notice of violation to the landowner. The notice of
violation shall contain:
(1) The name and address of the landowner, developer or applicant;
(2) The address, when available, or a description of the building,
structure or land upon which the violation is occurring;
(3) A statement specifying the nature of the violation;
(4) A description of the remedial measures necessary to bring the land
development activity into compliance with this chapter and a time
schedule for the completion of such remedial action;
(5) A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be
assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is
directed;
(6) A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to
the Planning Board by filing a written notice of appeal within 15
days of service of notice of violation.
B. The Town may issue a stop-work order for violations of this chapter.
Persons receiving a stop-work order shall be required to halt all land
development activities, except those activities that address the
violations leading to the stop-work order. The stop-work order shall be
in effect until the Town confirms that the land development activity is in
compliance and the violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure
to address a stop-work order in a timely manner may result in civil,
criminal, or monetary penalties in accordance with the enforcement
measures authorized in this chapter.
C. Any land development activity that is commenced or is conducted
contrary to this chapter may be restrained by injunction or otherwise
abated in a manner provided by law.
D. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided herein or by
law, any person who violates the provisions of this chapter shall be
§ 108A-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 108A-12
1:629

guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $500 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense, both
of which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by
a fine not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 or imprisonment for
a period not to exceed six months, or both; and upon conviction for
a third or subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a
period of five years, punishable by a fine not less than $1,000 nor more
than $2,500 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or
both. However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts
and judicial officers generally, violations of this chapter shall be deemed
misdemeanors and for such purpose only all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
E. If any building or land development activity is installed or conducted in
violation of this chapter, the Stormwater Management Officer may
prevent the occupancy of said building or land. It shall be the obligation
of the landowner to remediate the violation, at which time the
Stormwater Management Officer shall further consider allowing
occupancy of the building or land.
F. Any violator may be required to restore land to its undisturbed
condition. In the event that restoration is not undertaken within a
reasonable time after notice, the Town may take necessary corrective
action, the cost of which shall become a lien upon the property until
paid.
A. An application fee and inspection fee established by resolution of the
Town Board and set forth in the Master Fee Schedule,73 which may be
amended, shall be submitted with the application.
B. The Town Board, the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Appeals, in
review of any application for a stormwater pollution prevention plan
approval, may refer such application to such planner, attorney,
engineer, environmental expert or other consultant engaged by the
Town or to such Town professional staff as such Board shall deem
reasonably necessary to enable it to review such application as required
by law. [Amended 4-14-2009 by L.L. No. 5-2009]
(1) Fees charged by such consultant shall be in accord with fees
usually charged for such services in the metropolitan New York

costs shall be limited to those that are reasonable in amount and
are necessary for the Towns review and action on the application
in accordance with the law.
C. Escrow accounts. At the time of submission of any application for a
stormwater pollution prevention plan approval, the reviewing board
may require the establishment of an escrow account, from which
withdrawals shall be made to reimburse the Town for the cost of
consultant fees and professional staff services. The applicant shall then
provide funds to the Town for deposit into such account, in the amount
to be determined by the reviewing board based upon its evaluation of
the nature and complexity of the application. The applicant shall be
provided with copies of any Town voucher for consultant fees as they
are submitted to the Town and with Town staff time records for services
for which reimbursement is sought. When the balance in such escrow
account is reduced to 1/3 of its initial amount, the applicant shall
deposit additional funds into such account to restore the balance in
such account to the amount of the initial deposit. If such account is not
replenished within 30 days after the applicant is notified, in writing, of
the requirement for such additional deposit, the Board may suspend its
review of the application. A building permit or certificate of occupancy
or use shall not be issued unless all such applicants costs have been
reimbursed to the Town. After all pertinent costs have been paid, the
Town shall refund to the applicant any funds remaining on deposit.

§ 108B-2. Purpose; objectives.
A. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the Town of New Castle through the
regulation of nonstormwater discharges to the municipal separate
storm sewer system (MS4) to the maximum extent practicable as
required by federal and state law. This chapter establishes methods for
controlling the introduction of pollutants into the MS4 in order to
comply with requirements of the SPDES General Permit for Municipal
Separate Storm Sewer Systems.
B. The objectives of this chapter are:
(1) To meet the requirements of the SPDES General Permit for
Stormwater Discharges from MS4s, Permit No. GP-02-02, or as
amended or revised;
(2) To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the MS4 since such
systems are not designed to accept, process or discharge
nonstormwater wastes;
(3) To prohibit illegal discharges and illicit connections to the MS4;
(4) To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance
and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with
this chapter; and
(5) To promote public awareness of the hazards involved in the
improper discharge of trash, yard waste, lawn chemicals, pet
waste, wastewater, grease, oil, petroleum products, cleaning
products, paint products, hazardous waste, sediment and other
pollutants into the MS4.

laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been
granted for any discharge to the MS4.
B. Prohibition of illicit connections.
(1) The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the MS4 is prohibited.
(2) The prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection
was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at
the time of connection.
(3) A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the Town's MS4 or
allows such a connection to continue.
A. Activities that are subject to the requirements of this section include:
(1) Activities that cause or contribute to a violation of the Town's MS4

violations of the Town's MS4 SPDES permit authorization.
§ 108B-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 108B-8
1:637
§ 108B-9. Suspension of access to MS4.
A. Where the SMO has identified illegal discharges as defined in § 108B-3
or activities contaminating stormwater as defined in § 108B-7, the Town
may require implementation of best management practices (BMPs) to
control those illegal discharges and activities.
(1) The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into
the MS4 through the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs.
(2) Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may
be, the source of an illegal discharge as defined in § 108B-3 or an
activity contaminating stormwater as defined in § 108B-7, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional
structural and nonstructural BMPs to reduce or eliminate the
source of pollutant(s) to the MS4.
(3) Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with
the provisions of this section.
B. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or
such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the
watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive
vegetation and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or
significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In
addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned
structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures
will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical integrity of the
watercourse.
A. The SMO may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of
persons, or to the MS4. The SMO shall notify the person of such
suspension within a reasonable time thereafter, in writing, of the
reasons for the suspension. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the SMO may take such steps
as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or to
minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illegal discharge. Any person
discharging to the Town's MS4 in violation of this chapter may have
their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce
an illegal discharge. The SMO will notify a violator in writing of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor. The
violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
§ 108B-8 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 108B-9
1:638
§ 108B-10. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the Town prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
§ 108B-11. Access to property; inspection; monitoring of
discharges.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illegal
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent
its recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines in writing
that the illegal discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the
SMO.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this chapter, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,
or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which
constitutes a violation of this chapter.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records as may be required to implement this
chapter.
(3) The Town shall have the right to set up on any facility subject to this
chapter such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the SMO to
conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater
discharge.
(4) The Town has the right to require the facilities subject to this
chapter to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably necessary
to determine compliance with this chapter. The facility's sampling
and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own
expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality
shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
§ 108B-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 108B-11
1:639
§ 108B-12. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of this chapter, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the Town in person or by telephone or
facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or
by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed
to the Town within three business days of the telephone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain
an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent
its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
§ 108B-13. Notice of violation; penalties for offenses.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Town access to a facility
subject to this chapter is a violation of this chapter. A person who is
the operator of a facility subject to this chapter commits an offense
if the person denies the Town reasonable access to the facility for
the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by
this chapter.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
A. Notice of violation. When the Town's SMO finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter,
he/she may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
(1) The elimination of illicit connections or illegal discharges;
(2) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
(3) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
§ 108B-11 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 108B-13
1:640
§ 108B-14. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination
of the SMO to the Town Board within 15 days of its issuance. The Town
Board shall hear the appeal within 30 days after its filing. Within five days
of making its decision, the Town Board shall file same in the office of the
Town Clerk and mail a copy by certified mail to the charged party.
§ 108B-15. Corrective measures after appeal.
(4) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(5) Payment of a fine; and
(6) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
B. If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further
advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the
established deadline, the work will be done by the Town or a contractor
designated by the Town and the expense thereof shall be charged to the
violator.
C. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this chapter
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $500 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense, both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a
fine not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed six months, or both; and upon conviction for a third
or subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a period of
five years, punishable by a fine not less than $1,000 nor more than
$2,500 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both.
However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and
judicial officers generally, violations of this chapter shall be deemed
misdemeanors, and for such purpose, only all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within five
business days of the decision of the Town Board upholding the decision
of the SMO, then the SMO shall request the owner's permission for
access to the subject private property to take any and all measures
reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property.
B. If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek a
warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter
upon the property to determine whether a violation has occurred. Upon

It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this chapter. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the SMO may petition for
a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities
which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform
abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 108B-17. Alternative remedies.
determination that a violation has occurred, the SMO may seek a court
order to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate
the violation and/or restore the property. The cost of implementing
and maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the
discharger.
C. Within 10 days after abatement of the violation by or under
authorization of the SMO, the owner of the property will be notified of
the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property
owner may file a written protest with the Town Board objecting to the
amount of the charges within 10 days of receipt of said notice. If the
amount due is not paid within 30 days after the disposition of any
protest or the expiration of the time to file an appeal, whichever is
earlier, the charges shall become a lien on the property to be collected
in the same manner as real estate taxes.
A. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties and remedies authorized
by this chapter, where a person has violated a provision of this chapter,
he/she may be eligible for alternative remedies, upon recommendation
of the Town Counsel and concurrence of the SMO, where:
(1) The violation was unintentional.
(2) The violator has no history of previous violations of this chapter.
(3) Environmental damage was minimal.
(4) Violator acted quickly to remedy violation.

In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions
of this chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is
declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored
at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise
compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
§ 108B-19. Remedies not exclusive.
The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies
available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within

General Provisions
§ 113-1. Authority.
These regulations are adopted by authority of the Town Board resolution of
February 16, 1929, pursuant to the provisions of Article 16 of the Town Law
of the State of New York.
§ 113-2. Jurisdiction.
Land within the unincorporated portion of the Town of New Castle may be
subdivided into lots, blocks or sites, with or without streets or highways,
only if approved by the Planning Board in accordance with the procedures
and requirements as set forth in these regulations and only if the approved
plat is duly filed in the office of the County Clerk of Westchester County,
New York. Construction, excavation, filling, regrading, clearing of
vegetation or other similar activities related to a proposed subdivision shall
not be begun within any area proposed or intended for subdivision until
said subdivision shall have been approved or conditionally approved by the
Planning Board.
§ 113-3. Resubdivision. [Amended 3-9-1982; 10-12-1982]
A resubdivision, as defined herein, is subject to the same procedure, rules
and regulations applicable to an original subdivision, except that where
the Planning Board determines that a proposed resubdivision, if approved,
would be consistent with the general requirements for subdivision design
as set forth in these regulations, is not significant in terms of its potential
development impact and will not otherwise hinder or preclude the proper
future use of the subject property and surrounding sites, the Planning Board
may, by resolution, waive jurisdiction. Such waiver shall be subject to the
submission of a final resubdivision plat in proper form suitable for filing,
the payment of a preliminary application fee, the endorsement of waiver
by the Planning Board Chairman, filing of the plat in the office of the
Westchester County Clerk and such other conditions as the Planning Board
may determine to be necessary or appropriate.
§ 113-4. Policy.
It is declared to be the policy of the Town to consider land subdivisions
as part of a plan for the orderly, efficient and economical development of
the town. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can
be used safely for building or development purposes without danger to
health or peril from fire, flood or other menace and without resulting in
significant damage to the ecology of the area in which it is located. Proper
provision shall be made for drainage, water, sewerage, electric, telephone,
gas and other needed improvements. The proposed streets shall compose
a convenient system conforming to the Official Map and shall be properly
related to the proposals shown on the Town Development Plan. Streets shall
§ 113-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 113-4
1:681
be of such width, grade and location as to accommodate the prospective
traffic, to afford adequate light and air and to facilitate fire and police
protection. In proper cases and when required by the Planning Board, a
park or parks of suitable location, size and character for playground or
other recreational purposes shall be shown on the subdivision plat.
§ 113-5. Building permits.
No permit shall be issued for the erection of any building within a proposed
subdivision until said subdivision has been duly approved by the Planning
Board and filed in the office of the County Clerk, except that the Building
Inspector may issue a building permit for a single building based upon the
entire tract of land where there is no other existing building within the
proposed subdivision and where the location of the proposed building is in
accordance with an approved preliminary plat.
§ 113-6. Modification of regulations.
Where the Planning Board finds that, because of the special circumstances
of a particular case, extraordinary hardship may result from strict
compliance with these regulations, it may modify the regulations so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided,
however, that any such modification shall be consistent with the spirit and
intent of these regulations, all Town ordinances, the Town Development
Plan and the Official Map. In permitting any such modification, the Planning
Board shall attach such conditions as are, in its judgment, necessary to
secure substantially the objectives of the standard or requirement so
modified.
§ 113-7. Amendments.
A. Procedure. These regulations may be amended by the Planning Board
after public hearing and subject to the approval of the Town Board.
Notice of the time, place and purpose of such hearing shall be given by
publication in the official Town newspaper at least five days prior to the
date on which it is to be held. A copy of the proposed amendment shall
be placed on file in the office of the Town Clerk, where it shall be
available for public inspection during normal working hours for at least
five days before such hearing.
B. Applicability. Amendments adopted by the Planning Board shall take
effect on the date of Town Board approval or at such time as provided in
the resolution of approval and shall apply to any preliminary
subdivision which has not received conditional approval prior to such
date and to any conditionally approved subdivision for which a formal
application for final approval is not received within six months of the
date of conditional approval.

proceed to secure approval of the proposed subdivision in accordance with
the following steps:
A. Initial conference and review (recommended but not required).
B. Preparation of preliminary plat.
C. Preparation of final plat.
D. Reimbursement of professional review service fees. [Added 3-27-1990

public hearing on such final plat shall be coordinated with any hearings,
the Planning Board may schedule pursuant to the State Environmental
Quality Review Act. If the Planning Board deems the final plat to be in
substantial agreement with the approved preliminary plat, the Board
may waive the requirement for such a public hearing. Where a hearing
is to be held, the Planning Board Secretary shall submit a notice of said
hearing to the official Town newspaper for publication in said
§ 113-13 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 113-13
1:694
newspaper at least five days before such hearing; provided, however,
that notice of said hearing shall be published at least 14 days before
such hearing where the hearing on the final plat is held jointly with the
hearing on an environmental impact statement. A copy of the proposed
plat and construction plans shall be maintained on file in the Town Hall,
available for public inspection during normal business hours for the
five-day period immediately preceding the hearing.
D. Action by Planning Board. Within 62 days after the close of the public
hearing or within 62 days of the official submission date of the final
application when a hearing is waived, the Planning Board shall, by
resolution, conditionally approve, with or without modification, or
disapprove or grant final approval and authorize the signing of the plat.
However, consistent with § 276 of the Town Law, if the Planning Board
determines that an environmental impact statement is required, no
decision shall be made on the final plat until the filing of the final
environmental impact statement and the issuance of findings by the
Planning Board. The time in which the Planning Board must take action
may be extended by mutual consent of the owner and the Planning
Board. Within five business days of the adoption of such resolution, the
plat shall be certified by the Planning Board Secretary as conditionally
or finally approved, and one copy shall be filed in the Planning Board
office. A copy of the resolution shall be filed in the Town Clerk's office
and another copy mailed to the owner by certified mail, including the
certified statement of the requirements which, when completed, will
authorize the signing of the conditionally approved final plat.
Conditional approval of a final plat shall expire within 180 days after
the date of the resolution granting conditional approval, unless such
requirements have been certified as completed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Planning Board may extend the time in which a
conditionally approved plat in final form must be submitted for
signature, if, in its opinion, such intention is warranted by the particular
circumstances thereof, for not to exceed two additional periods of 90
days each.
E. Authorization for filing plat by sections. Prior to granting its approval,
the Planning Board may permit the plat to be subdivided into two or
more sections and may impose such conditions upon the delineation
and filing of the sections as it may deem necessary to assure the orderly
development of the plat. Approval of the sections, subject to any
conditions imposed by the Board, shall be granted concurrently with
approval of the plat. If the owner files only a section of an approved plat
within 30 days of the date of approval, such section shall encompass at
least 10% of the total number of lots contained in the approved plat.
Within 30 days of the filing of a section of an approved plat with the
County Clerk, the owner shall file the entire approved plat with the New
Castle Town Clerk. The Planning Board may deny approval of any
subsequent section if a prior approved section has not first been
satisfactorily completed.
§ 113-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 113-13
1:695
F. Action by applicant. Based upon the Planning Board resolution, the
applicant shall have the final subdivision plat and construction plans
revised, if necessary, in accordance with said resolution and submit the
four copies of such revised maps to the Secretary of the Planning
Board. Any performance bond which is to be posted shall be submitted
to the Town Attorney. The Town Engineer shall check the revised final
maps to determine whether they are in full compliance with the
Planning Board's resolution of approval and, if so, shall so certify to the
Planning Board. The Town Attorney shall be responsible for
determining and certifying to the Planning Board whether or not the
surety, form, sufficiency and manner of execution of the bond is
acceptable to and has been approved by the Town Board.
G. Approval of construction plans. The construction plans, revised as
necessary to meet the requirements of the Planning Board resolution,
shall be endorsed by the Planning Board Chairman or other duly
authorized member of the Planning Board as "approved" prior to the
signing of the plat or the beginning of any construction work within the
proposed subdivision.
H. Final approval of subdivision plat. The Chairman or other duly
authorized member of the Planning Board shall endorse the Board's
final approval on the plat only after receipt of certification from the
Town Engineer that all required improvements have been completed in
accordance with the Planning Board's approval of the plat and
construction plans or, alternatively, that a bond in the required amount
and surety has been filed and that all other required conditions of the
resolution of approval, including the payment of all fees, have been
complied with. Said endorsement shall be by signature and date on the
original of the plat (which shall be returned to the applicant for filing)
and on a print of the plat (which shall be retained in the record files of
the Planning Board).
I. Filing plat with County Clerk. The signature of the Chairman or other
duly authorized member of the Planning Board constituting final
approval by the Planning Board of a subdivision plat shall expire within
62 days from the date of such approval, unless within such sixty-twoday
period such plat or section thereof shall have been duly filed or
recorded by the owner in the office of the Westchester County Clerk,
Division of Land Records.
J. Submission of copies of final plat. The applicant shall submit 10 copies
of the final plat, showing the endorsement of the County Clerk, to the
Planning Board Secretary within 30 days of the date of filing.

ARTICLE IV
Required Improvements and Agreements
§ 113-14. Completion of improvements or filing of bond. [Amended
6-9-1992 by L.L. No. 11-199286]
After adoption of a resolution approving a final subdivision plat and before
the plat is endorsed by the Planning Board Chairman or other duly
authorized member, the applicant shall be required to complete, at his
expense and without reimbursement by the Town or any special district,
all street and other improvements as shown on the approved construction
plans or otherwise specified in the resolution or, as an alternative, file with
the Town Board a bond, letter of credit or other security acceptable to the
Town Board in an amount fixed by the Planning Board in its resolution as
sufficient to secure to the Town the satisfactory construction, installation
and completion of the required improvements. Such bond, letter of credit
or other security shall state the period within which the required
improvements must be completed, which period shall be that specified in
the Planning Board resolution. In the event that the issuer of the bond
or other security furnished to the Town hereunder becomes insolvent or
for any reason disaffirms the validity of such security, the applicant shall
notify the Town Board immediately and replace the invalid security with a
new bond or other security acceptable to the Town Board within 30 days
thereafter. The existence of a valid bond, letter of credit or other security
shall be a condition precedent to the validity of any permits issued or to be
issued in connection with any subdivision. All improvements shall be done to
the satisfaction of the Planning Board and in accordance with the approved
construction plans and the requirements of these regulations and the Town
construction standards and specifications. The term "improvement" shall
include all facilities intended to be dedicated as public facilities and
roadways, water and sewer facilities, drainage and erosion controls and soil
stabilization improvements not intended to be so dedicated.
§ 113-15. Failure to complete improvements.
A. Where a bond is not filed. If all required improvements are not
completed within the period specified in the Planning Board resolution
of approval, such approval shall be deemed to have expired unless,
upon request of the applicant, the period has been extended by
resolution of the Planning Board.
B. Where a bond is filed. If all required improvements are not completed
within the term specified by the Planning Board and set forth in the
filed bond, and if no application for the extension of such period and
bond has been made by the applicant and approved by the Planning
Board, the Town Board may thereupon declare said bond to be in
default and collect the sum remaining payable thereunder, and upon
receipt of the proceeds thereof the Town shall install such
86.Editor's Note: This local law stated that it superseded inconsistent provisions of Town Law
§§ 274-a and 277, Subdivision 1.
§ 113-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 113-15
1:697
§ 113-16. Modification of bond.
§ 113-17. Modification of requirements.
If at any time, either before or during the course of construction of the
required improvements, it is determined by the Planning Board that
unforeseen conditions make it necessary to modify the location or design
of any improvements, the Board may modify the terms and conditions of
the approval so as to require such changes as may be necessary to comply
with the spirit and intent of the Board's original approval and to conform
to accepted engineering practices. If such modification affects the scope
of work covered by a bond, the Board may require or allow appropriate
modification of such bond.
§ 113-18. Inspection of improvements; certification; fee.
The Town Engineer shall be responsible for inspecting required
improvements during construction to ensure their satisfactory completion
and, upon such completion, shall furnish the Planning Board with a
statement to that effect. If the Town Engineer determines that any of the
required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the
approved plan, the applicant shall be responsible for properly completing
said improvements. Failure of the Town Engineer to carry out inspections
improvements as are covered by the bond and are commensurate with
the extent of building development that has taken place in the
subdivision, but not exceeding in cost the amount of such proceeds.
A. Extension of period specified in bond. The time period specified for the
completion of all required improvements, as set forth in the bond, may
be extended only by resolution of the Planning Board upon request by
the applicant setting forth, in detail, the amount of work which has been
completed, reasons for failure to complete the remainder of the work
within the specified period, the maximum estimated time required to
complete the remainder of the work and the time period extension
which is requested.
B. Reduction of bond. An applicant may request, in writing, that the Town
Board authorize a reduction in the amount of the bond. Such request
shall itemize the extent of required improvements already completed,
the estimated cost of improvements remaining to be completed and the
amount of bond reduction requested. It shall be accompanied by a cost
estimate fee as set forth by resolution of the Town Board in the Master
Fee Schedule, which may be amended. Then the Town Board may, if it
determines that sufficient required improvements have been installed
to warrant such action, reduce the face amount of the bond by an
appropriate amount so that the new amount will cover the cost in full of
all required improvements remaining to be completed, and any security
deposited with the bond may be reduced proportionately. [Amended
9-10-2002 by L.L. No. 8-2002; 3-9-2010 by L.L. No. 2-2010]
§ 113-15 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 113-18
1:698
of required improvements during construction shall not in any way relieve
the applicant or the bonding company of its responsibilities related to the
proper construction of such improvements.
A. Inspection of stages of construction.
(1) To facilitate inspection of required improvements during
construction, the applicant shall notify the Town Engineer at least
three working days before reaching each of the following stages of
construction:
(a) Rough grading completed.
(b) Drainage and other underground facilities installed, but prior
to backfilling.
(c) After gravel base is spread and compacted.
(d) When each pavement course is being applied.
(e) After completion of all improvements.
(2) The applicant shall not proceed to work on any stage subsequent to
the first stage until the work of the previous stage has been
inspected and approved by the Town Engineer or his duly
authorized representative. In the case of any other improvements,
the Town Engineer shall inspect the work at such progressive
stages as he shall specify, and he shall certify to the Planning Board
that the work was inspected by him and was in accordance with the
approved plans and specifications.
B. Certification of mix data. Upon request of the Town Engineer or his duly
authorized representative, the applicant shall furnish a certification
from the bituminous concrete supplier providing mix data, including
aggregate source and grading, quantities of all ingredients and critical
temperatures.
C. Test specimens. When test specimens are requested by the Town
Engineer or his duly authorized representative, the contractor shall cut
and transport the necessary sample to a laboratory selected by the
Town Engineer. Costs of tests and reports shall be borne entirely by the
applicant.
D. Certificate of construction. At such time as the applicant has completed
construction of all required improvements, he shall furnish to the Town
Engineer three copies of as-built plans and profiles which show the
actual location of all paved streets, culverts, headwalls, drains,
manholes, catch basins, sidewalks, curbs, utility lines and equipment,
monuments, street signs, street trees and all other required
improvements, as constructed, and all other pertinent information,
such as cross sections of the streets at intervals determined by the
Town Engineer, the culvert and drain grades, sewer grades, sidewalk
and curb grades and invert elevations at manholes. Such plans and
§ 113-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 113-18
1:699
§ 113-19. Future status of streets, parks and easements. [Amended
2-9-1993 by L.L. No. 4-1993]
profiles shall bear a date certification by a professional engineer or
licensed surveyor to the effect that the data shown thereon was
accurately determined by filed survey. If the location or accuracy of
improvements does not, in the opinion of the Planning Board, fully
comply with the approved construction plans and specifications, the
Planning Board shall have the right to refuse to sign the final plat or
release the bond until such situation is corrected.
E. Inspection fee. To offset the costs incurred by the Town in conducting
inspections, all applicants for approval of subdivisions involving the
construction of streets and/or other improvements shall be required to
submit an inspection fee, payable to the Town of New Castle, equal in
amount of 3% of the estimated cost of improvements, as determined by
the Planning Board.
A. Offers of cession. All streets, parks and easements shall be indicated on
the plat. In accordance with § 278 of the Town Law, the applicant may
add as part of the plat a notation, if he so desires, to the effect that no
offer of dedication of such streets or parks or any of them is made to the
public. All offers of cession to the public of all streets and parks not so
marked shall be filed with the Planning Board at the time of submission
of the application for final plat approval.
B. Petition for dedication. Upon completion of the subdivision and the
street(s), a petition in the form required by the Town Board shall be
filed with such Board for the acceptance and dedication of the street(s)
and the acceptance of parks or any other reservations or easements.
C. Acceptance by town. Acceptance of any offer of cession of streets or
parks shall rest with the Town Board. In the event that the applicant
shall elect not to file the plat in the office of the County Clerk within the
period prescribed for such filing, then such formal offer of cession shall
be deemed void. The approval by the Planning Board of a subdivision
plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the
Town of any streets, parks or other areas shown on said plat, and the
Planning Board may require the addition of appropriate notes to that
effect on the plat.
D. Maintenance. In the event that no offer of cession to the public is made
for the streets, parks and required easements shown on the plat, there
shall be submitted with the application for final plat approval copies of
agreements or other documents providing for the suitable maintenance
of such facilities and a statement of all rights which exist with respect
to each of them. The adequacy of such documents shall be subject to
Planning Board approval.
§ 113-18 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 113-20
1:700
§ 113-20. Waiver of required improvements.
The Planning Board may waive, subject to appropriate conditions, the
provisions of any or all such improvements and requirements as, in its
judgment of the special circumstances of a particular plat, are not requisite
in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare or which, in
its judgment, are inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting
facilities adjacent or in proximity to the subdivision.
§ 113-21. Certificates of occupancy for structures fronting on
bonded streets.
A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for a structure within a
subdivision where the improvements are guaranteed by a performance
bond unless it is determined by the Planning Board that both of the
following conditions have been complied with:
A. Status of street improvements. The improvement of the street or streets
giving access to the structure has progressed to a stage deemed
adequate by the Planning Board to render safe all-weather vehicular
access for both routing and emergency purposes.
B. Maintenance agreements. Written agreements have been filed
providing for the maintenance of the bonded street or streets in such
all-weather passable conditions, including snow removal and sanding,
during the period between the issuance of the certificate of occupancy
and the acceptance of the fully completed street by the Town Board. If
the street is not to be offered for dedication to the town, such an
agreement will have been required in accordance with § 113-19D of
these regulations. In either case, the agreement shall be in recordable
form and shall include a provision permitting the town, upon 24 hours'
notice by telegram or shorter period if reasonably required under the
prevailing circumstances, to contract for the performance of such
maintenance for any street providing access to a building for which a
certificate of occupancy has been issued if such maintenance has not
been accomplished by the street owner to the satisfaction of the Town
Engineer. Any sums expended by the Town for such maintenance
purposes shall be borne by the owner of the street and, if not paid
within 30 days of the date of billing, shall become a lien upon all
property owned by him within the subdivision. [Amended 5-9-1978]

ARTICLE V
General Requirements for Subdivision Design
§ 113-22. Use of standards in considering applications.
The Planning Board, in considering an application for the subdivision of
land, shall be guided by the following considerations and standards, which
standards shall be deemed to be the minimum requirements for the
convenience, health, safety and welfare of the town.
§ 113-23. General standards.
A. Character of land. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that
it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or
peril from fire, flood or other menace. Land subject to such hazards
shall not be subdivided nor developed for residential purposes nor for
such other uses as may increase danger to health, life or property or
aggravate a flood hazard, but such land may be set aside for such uses
as shall not involve such danger nor produce unsatisfactory living
conditions.
B. Preservation of natural and historical features. [Amended 2-9-1993
by L.L. No. 4-1993]
(1) Land to be subdivided shall be designed in reasonable conformity
to existing topography in order to minimize grading and cut and fill
and to retain, insofar as possible, the natural contours, to limit
stormwater runoff and to conserve the natural vegetative cover and
soil. No tree, topsoil or excavated material shall be removed from
its natural position except where necessary and incidental to the
improvement of lots and the construction of streets and related
facilities in accordance with the approved construction plans.
Topsoil shall be restored to a depth of at least six inches and
properly seeded and fertilized in those disturbed areas not
occupied by buildings or structures.
(2) Existing natural and historical features that are of ecological,
aesthetic or scenic value to residential development or to the Town
as a whole, such as wetlands, watercourses, water bodies,
floodplains, aquifers and aquifer recharge areas, stands of trees,
wildlife habitats, hilltops, ridge lines, steep slopes, rock formations,
stone walls, historic sites and structures, archaeological sites and
similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved, insofar as possible,
through harmonious design of the subdivision; and where
appropriate, the Planning Board may require the inclusion of such
features in permanent reservations.
C. Conformity to Town Development Plan and Official Map. Streets, parks
and other subdivision features shall conform to the Town Development
Plan and the Official Map.
§ 113-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 113-23
1:703
§ 113-23.1. Conservation development. [Added 2-8-1999 by L.L. No.
2-1999]
In accordance with the Town Board authorization contained in § 60-428 of
the Town Code, the Planning Board may, upon application of the property
owner, or upon the Planning Board's own motion, modify applicable zoning
provisions simultaneously with the approval of a subdivision plat in order to
promote the purposes and intent of that section. Any such action shall be
taken within the limitations imposed by § 278 of the Town Law and § 60-428
of the Town Code, as well as in compliance with the following rules and
regulations:
D. Frontage on improved streets. The area proposed to be subdivided shall
have frontage on and direct access to a street duly placed on the Official
Map, and if such street is not improved to the satisfaction of the
Planning Board, such improvement shall be a condition of subdivision
approval. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary
and except with respect to the application of § 281 of the Town Law, the
subdivision of property into lots having no street frontage and for which
access to a street is derived by way of an easement shall be prohibited.
Relief from this provision may be granted only upon application to and
after hearing on due notice to the parties by the Zoning Board of
Appeals upon a showing of unnecessary hardship as required in
connection with the granting of a use variance pursuant to § 60-421.2 of
Chapter 60, Zoning. [Amended 2-11-1991 by L.L. No. 1-1991]
E. Westchester County Greenway Compact Plan. By Local Law No. 5 of the
Year 2007, the Town of New Castle has adopted the Westchester County
Greenway Compact Plan, as amended from time to time and accepted
by the Town of New Castle as set forth in Chapter 136, as a statement of
policies, principles, and guides to supplement other established land
use policies in the Town. In its discretionary actions under this chapter,
the reviewing agency should take into consideration said statement of
policies, principles and guides, as appropriate. [Added 5-8-2007 by
L.L. No. 5-2007]
F. Required model ordinance provisions affordable AFFH unit component.
Within all subdivisions of at least eight but less than 10 building lots, at
least one of the building lots must be created as a lot on which a model
ordinance provisions affordable AFFH unit will be located, and within
all subdivisions of 10 or more building lots, no less than 10% of the total
number of building lots must be created as lots on which model
ordinance provisions affordable AFFH units will be located. No
preferences shall be used to prioritize the selection of income-eligible
tenants or purchasers of any model ordinance provisions affordable
AFFH unit created under this section. [Added 8-9-2011 by L.L. No.
10-2011]
A. An applicant desiring to use the standards set forth in § 60-428 of the
Town Code shall file, with the Planning Board, the application and plans
required for subdivision review and approval as set forth in Chapter
§ 113-23 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 113-23.1
1:704
113, Subdivision of Land. Such application and plans shall have clearly
marked upon their face that said plan is for development in accordance
with these standards. The applicant shall also submit a written, detailed
statement setting forth the nature of modifications, changes or
supplementations of existing zoning provisions and the reasons for
the same. Such statement shall include the manner in which such
modifications, changes or supplementations of existing zoning
provisions will benefit the Town and will further the public health,
safety or welfare. The applicant may be required, at various stages of
the planning process, to further justify the request to use the standards
and procedures set forth in § 60-428 of the Town Code. The applicant
shall also provide such additional information or data in support of
its application as may reasonably be determined to be necessary by
the Planning Board. Such application, and additional information or
data, shall also be submitted in an electronic file format. [Amended
3-27-2012 by L.L. No. 1-2012]
B. Prior to the Planning Board determining whether and to what extent
any modifications of the otherwise applicable zoning provisions shall be
required of an applicant who has not requested such modifications, said
Board shall determine that the modifications would benefit the Town by
satisfying one or more of the purposes set forth in § 60-428 of the Town
Code; and the modifications are necessary to satisfactorily achieve one
or more of the following specific objectives:
(1) The preservation of a unique or significant natural feature of the
site, including but not limited to a vegetative feature, wildlife
habitat, surface water supply, underground aquifer, endangered
species, rock formation and steep slopes.
(2) The protection of a unique or significant feature of the man-made
environment of the site, including but not limited to a building,
structure or artifact of architectural, historical or archaeological
value.
(3) The preservation of any unique or significant aesthetic feature of
the site, including but not limited to a community vista, ridgeline or
roadside character.
(4) The creation of useful recreation or open space areas, whether
passive or active, to serve the needs of the residents of the
subdivision or of the town.
(5) The creation of the most efficient layout of new subdivisions,
including the shape or location of house sites, driveways or roads.
(6) The protection of any other unique or significant feature of the site
which the Planning Board determines to be important for
recreation, education, historic, open space or similar purposes.
C. Where the Planning Board on its own motion has required a zoning
modification not requested by the property owner, the degree of such
§ 113-23.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 113-23.1
1:705
§ 113-24. Streets.
required modification shall be to the extent necessary to properly
accomplish the objective or objectives associated with the criteria set
forth above in the judgment of the Planning Board.
D. In the case of modifications of applicable zoning provisions required on
the Planning Board's own motion, said Board shall notify the applicant,
in writing, of the specific modifications which will be required. Such
notification shall occur prior to the time of conditional approval of a
preliminary subdivision plat. The required modifications shall then
become a mandatory condition which must be complied with as a part
of the final plat application.
E. In addition to compliance with the special requirements and procedures
for close conservation development, such development shall also be
subject to review and public hearing by the Planning Board in
accordance with the procedures otherwise applicable to conventional
subdivision plats.
F. Upon the filing of a conservation development plat in the office of the
Westchester County Clerk, a copy shall also be filed with the Town
Clerk, who shall make appropriate notations and references thereof on
the official copy of the Town Zoning Map.
A. Location, width and improvement. Streets shall be suitably located, of
sufficient width and adequately improved to accommodate the expected
traffic and to afford satisfactory access by police, fire-fighting, snowremoval
and other utility and road maintenance equipment, and shall
be coordinated so as to compose a safe and convenient system.
B. Relation to topography. Streets shall be appropriately related to the
natural topography and shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as
possible of the building sites at or above the grades of the streets. A
combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided.
C. Intersections. Cross-street (four-cornered) intersections shall be
avoided insofar as possible, except at important traffic locations. A
distance at least equal to the minimum required lot width but not less
than 150 feet shall be maintained between center lines of offset
intersecting streets. Within 70 feet of the center of an intersection,
streets shall be at approximately right angles, and grades shall be
limited to 3%. Wherever two streets intersect at an angle of less than
75°, special pavement, channelization, right-of-way and/or sight
easement restrictions may be required by the Planning Board.
[Amended 2-9-1993 by L.L. No. 4-1993]
D. Continuation of streets into adjacent properties. [Amended
2-26-1980]
(1) The arrangement of streets shall provide for their continuation
between adjacent properties where such continuation is
§ 113-23.1 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 113-24
1:706
determined necessary by the Planning Board for proper traffic
movement, effective fire protection, efficient provision of utilities,
snow removal and other services and/or where such continuation
is in accordance with the Town Development Plan. Alternatively, if
a street continuation is not determined by the Planning Board to
be warranted by the circumstances or would result in unsafe traffic
conditions or otherwise jeopardize the public safety and welfare,
the Planning Board may require such street to be terminated short
of the boundary lines of the subdivision.
(2) Where a continuation of a street beyond the boundaries of a
subdivision is determined to be warranted by the Planning Board
but the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must deadend
temporarily, the Planning Board may require that the right-ofway
and all improvements be extended to the property line. A
temporary circular turnaround shall be provided on all temporary
dead-end streets in excess of 100 feet in length, with a notation on
the plat that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert
to abutting property owners upon continuation of the street. Where
the Planning Board, for reasons of traffic safety or efficiency,
adequacy of emergency access or for such other purposes as set
forth above, determines that the length of a temporary dead-end
street should be limited until such time as it can be connected
through in the future, the Planning Board shall so limit the length
of such streets to the extent determined necessary by said Board
based upon the specific circumstances of the proposed plat.
(3) Where a turnaround exists at the end of a street within an adjoining
development to which a proposed street is to connect, the applicant
may be required to remove the portions of the turnaround
pavement outside the normal width of the traveled way, perform
any necessary reconstruction of the pavement edge, construct

and regrade and seed and drain the disturbed areas in such a
manner as to blend them in with the surrounding landscape.
E. Permanent dead-end streets. [Amended 2-26-1980]
(1) Where a street does not extend to the boundary of a subdivision
and its future continuation is not required by the Board, it shall be
separated from such boundary by a distance not less than the
minimum required lot depth. The Planning Board may require the
reservation of an easement to the boundary to accommodate
utilities, drainage facilities and/or pedestrian traffic. A circular
turnaround shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead-end
street.
(2) For purposes of traffic convenience and safety, greater efficiency in
providing utilities and services, more effective police and fire
protection and for such other purposes as are set forth in this Code,
the Planning Board may limit the length of any permanent dead-

Streets shall be graded and improved with pavement, sidewalks, gutters
and curbs or swales, shoulders, streetlighting standards, street signs, street
trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm drains, fire alarm signal devices,
fire hydrants and other, utilities, except that the Planning Board may waive,
subject to appropriate conditions, such improvements as it considers not
requisite in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare. The
subdivider shall install underground service connections to the property
line of each lot before the street is paved. Except where waivers are
granted, all such grading and street improvements shall conform in all
respects to these regulations and to the Town construction standards and
specifications.
end street to eight times the minimum lot width for the zoning
district in which it is located, exclusive of the turnaround area, or
to such other length in excess thereof as said Board determines
appropriate after considering the specific circumstances of the
proposed plat.
F. Street names. Street names shall be sufficiently different in sound and
in spelling from other street names in the Town so as not to cause
confusion. A street which is a continuation of an existing street shall
bear the same name. In general, street names shall conform to the
following classifications:
(1) Avenue, street or road: major or collector street.
(2) Drive or lane: minor residential streets, except as follows:
(a) Court or place: permanent dead-end street.
(b) Circle or loop: street that returns to a starting point, or a street
both ends of which intersect another street at different
locations.
G. Design standards for streets. Streets shall meet the design standards
set forth in Appendix I hereof.87 Street classification may be indicated
on the Town Development Plan or may be determined by the Planning
Board. Standards are not shown for major roads, which in most cases
would be built by the state or county.
H. Solar access. To permit maximum solar access to proposed lots and
future buildings wherever reasonably feasible and consistent with other
appropriate design considerations, new streets shall be located on an
east-west axis to encourage house siting with maximum exposure of
roof and wall areas to the sun. [Added 9-14-1982]

§ 113-26. Drainage improvements.
§ 113-27. Underground utilities.
In order to assure greater safety and improved appearance, all utility lines
and related equipment for providing power and communication services
shall be installed underground in the manner prescribed by the regulations
of the utility company having jurisdiction. Underground utility lines shall
be located outside of the traveled way of the streets but, except in unusual
circumstances, within the street right-of-way. Underground service
connections shall be provided to the property line of each lot before the
street is paved and may pass under the traveled way of the street.
§ 113-28. Other improvements.
A. The subdivider may be required by the Planning Board to carry away by
pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either
previous to or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities
shall be located in the street right-of-way where feasible or in perpetual
unobstructed easements of appropriate width and shall be constructed
in accordance with the Town construction standards and specifications.
B. Drainage facilities shall, in each case, be large enough to accommodate
potential runoff from their entire upstream drainage area, whether
inside or outside the subdivision, based on a one-hundred-year storm
and assuming conditions of maximum potential development within the
watershed as permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.88 The applicant shall
be responsible for submitting such computations to the Town Engineer
in sufficient detail to make possible the ready determination of the
adequacy of the proposed drainage installations, and the Town
Engineer shall be responsible for reviewing these and preparing
recommendations for the Planning Board.
C. The Planning Board may also require the subdivider to prepare a study
of the effects of the subdivision on existing downstream drainage
facilities. Where such study or the Planning Board, after an
independent analysis, determines that the additional runoff incident to
the development of the subdivision will overload an existing
downstream drainage facility, the Planning Board shall notify the owner
of such downstream facility of such potential condition and may
withhold approval of the subdivision until provision has been made for
the correction of said potential condition.
A. Monuments.
(1) Monuments shall be required wherever deemed necessary by the
Planning Board to enable all lines to be readily reproduced on the
ground. In general, monuments shall be located no more than 500
feet apart on street lines, preferably at street, lot or easement
88.Editor's Note: See Ch. 60, Zoning.
§ 113-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 113-28
1:709
corners or at points of curvature or tangency on curved streets, and
spaced to be within sight of one another along lines entirely within
the street right-of-way.
(2) Monuments shall be set vertically in solid ground three inches
above ground surface with accurate reference to a permanently
identifiable fixed point and shall meet or exceed the construction
requirements specified in the Town construction standards and
specifications.
B. Traffic control and street signs. Traffic control and street signs shall be
provided by the subdivider and placed at all intersections, within the
street right-of-way, and in other locations as required by the approving
authority. In the case of traffic control signs, their type and location
shall be approved by the Chief of Police of the Town of New Castle, and
in the case of street signs, by the Superintendent of Highways of the
Town of New Castle.
C. Streetlighting standards. Where required by the Planning Board,
streetlighting standards, of a design and location approved by said
Board, shall be provided and installed by the subdivider.
D. Sanitary sewers and sewerage facilities; water mains and water supply
facilities; fire hydrants. Where required by the Planning Board, the
subdivider shall install sanitary sewers and sewerage facilities and/or
water mains and water supply facilities and fire hydrants of the type
and in a manner prescribed by the regulations of the appropriate sewer,
water or fire district or other municipal agency having jurisdiction.
E. Dry hydrants. Where the installation of water mains and fire hydrants is
not required, the Planning Board may require the installation of dry
hydrants where it is determined that such hydrants are desirable and a
satisfactory source of water supply can be made available. In situations
determined appropriate by the Planning Board, it may require the
construction or enlargement of a pond or other water body for the
purpose of providing such a water supply. Dry hydrant hose connections
shall be located at suitable points along improved streets. Such dry
hydrants shall be installed and constructed in accordance with
specifications approved by the Town Engineer.
F. Fire alarm signal devices. Where required by the Planning Board, the
subdivider shall install fire alarm signal devices, including necessary
ducts, cables and other connecting facilities, of a type and in a manner
and location prescribed by the appropriate fire district or other
municipal agency having jurisdiction.
G. Street trees. The Planning Board may require the planting of street
trees. Such trees shall be of a hardwood variety indigenous to the
neighborhood and shall be at least four inches caliper at a height of four
feet above ground level. Where they are required by the Planning
Board, such trees shall be planted along both sides of the street, within
the street right-of-way, and spaced approximately 75 feet on center.

§ 113-29. Flood damage considerations. [Added 4-9-1974; amended
9-27-1977; 9-13-1988 by L.L. No. 16-1988]
Within areas of special flood hazard, the Planning Board shall also review
subdivision proposals for compliance with the requirements of Chapter 70,
Flood Damage Prevention.
§ 113-30. Lots.
H. School bus pickup areas. The Planning Board may require that the
subdivider reserve, clear, grade, pave and otherwise improve an area of
such size and location as will provide a safe and suitable place for the
use of children awaiting school buses. In general, the size of such area
shall not be less than 100 square feet, and no dimension shall be less
than eight feet. Such area shall be included within the street right-ofway
and shall be maintained by the holder of fee title to the street. The
layout and design shall be subject to Planning Board approval.
A. Lot and driveway arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that
there will be no foreseeable difficulty, for reasons of topography or
other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in
compliance with Chapter 60, Zoning, Chapter 64, Environmental
Protection Overlay Regulations if the property is located within an
Environmental Protection Overlay District, Chapter 70, Flood Damage
Prevention, Chapter 108, Steep Slope Protection, Chapter 137,
Wetlands, and the County Health Department regulations and in
providing adequate driveway access to buildings on such lots from an
approved street in compliance with the driveway requirements of
Chapter 60, Zoning. The Planning Board shall review the arrangement
of the lots to assure that they can be developed without unnecessary
disturbance to unique natural and historical features of the site. The
Planning Board shall also consider the arrangement of lots with respect
to the promotion of energy conservation and the maximization of solar
access. [Amended 9-14-1982; 9-13-1988 by L.L. No. 16-1988;
2-9-1993 by L.L. No. 4-1993; 7-23-2002 by L.L. No. 5-2002]
B. Lot dimensions. [Amended 2-11-1991 by L.L. No. 1-1991]
(1) Except as provided elsewhere in these regulations or otherwise
permitted by the Town Board, lot areas and dimensions shall
comply with at least the minimum standards of the Zoning
Ordinance for the district in which they are located. Where relief
from the frontage requirement has been granted by the Zoning
Board of Appeals pursuant to § 60-421.2 of the Zoning Ordinance,
the lot line which is generally parallel to and nearest the street
from which the lot derives access shall be deemed the front lot line.
A yard equal to the required front yard shall be provided with
respect to any lot line at an angle of 45° or less to the street and
located between the street and a principal building contained
thereon if such line is wholly or partially in front of said building, as
§ 113-28 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 113-30
1:711
well as with respect to any lot line that is generally opposite the
front facade of the principal building located on said lot. A yard
equal to the required rear yard shall be provided with respect to
any side lot line at an angle of 45° or less to the street if such
line is wholly or partially behind the principal building, as well
as with respect to any lot line that is generally opposite the rear
facade of the principal building located on said lot. Where lots
are more than double the minimum required area, the Planning
Board may require that they be arranged so as to allow for further
subdivision and the opening of future streets where necessary
to serve such potential lots, all in compliance with the Zoning
Ordinance and with these regulations. Where, in the opinion of
the Planning Board, lots of larger than minimum size are required
for purposes of proper drainage, water supply, waste disposal or
the preservation of important ecological features, the Board may
require such oversized lots as a condition of plat approval.
(2) Side lot lines shall generally be at right angles to street lines (or
radial to curving street lines) unless the Planning Board allows a
variation from this rule to provide a better street or lot
arrangement. Dimensions of corner lots and double-frontage lots
shall be large enough to allow for erection of buildings observing
the minimum front yard setback from all streets.
(3) Where a proposed subdivision includes an existing residence larger
in size than can appropriately be placed on a lot of the minimum
size permitted in the zoning district, the Planning Board may
require that the lot be of such a size and relationship to the
proposed street system that the structure will be an appropriate
and harmonious part of the subdivision.
C. Density averaging. In an R-2A (two-acre) One-Family Residence
District, if the subdivider can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Planning Board that unusual topographic conditions exist, or where lot
sizes of abutting properties are less than two acres, the Board may, at
the request of the subdivider made at the time of submission of the
preliminary plat, permit averaging the density as permitted by
resolution of the Town Board adopted June 28, 1960,89 and subject to
the following:
89.Editor's Note: The resolution adopted by the Town Board of the Town of New Castle on
June 28, 1960, read as follows: "RESOLVED, that the Planning Board of the Town of New
Castle be, and it hereby is, granted the power under § 281 of the Town Law,
simultaneously with the approval of a plat within the Town of New Castle outside the
limits of the Village of Mount Kisco, to make any reasonable change in the provisions of
the Zoning Ordinance of the Town of New Castle relating to the land so platted as shown
on the Official Zoning Map of said town, provided that, in addition to the restrictions
contained in said § 281, the power hereby granted is further restricted as follows: A. It
shall apply to R-1 (two-acre) Districts [Editor's Note: The former R-1 (two-acre) Districts
are known as R-2A (two-acre) Districts in the current Zoning Ordinance adopted June 21,
1971.] B. It shall be subject to amendment of the Land Subdivision Regulations of the
Planning Board of the Town of New Castle, Westchester County, New York following a
public hearing by the Planning Board, and subsequent approval by the Town Board of the
Town of New Castle."
§ 113-30 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 113-30
1:712
(1) No lot shall be less than 1.5 acres.
(2) For the purpose of computing the average size of lots, only the land
area available for building lots can be considered and all other
portions of the subdivision shall be excluded, and the acreage in
excess of 3.5 acres of any single lot shall be excluded.
(3) In no subdivision shall the number of lots having less than two
acres exceed 25% of the total number of building lots.
(4) The preliminary plat, in addition to the above considerations, shall
show the layout of lots in the entire development.
D. Access from major and collector roads. Lots shall not, in general, derive
access from a major or collector road but shall derive access from a
local road. Where driveway access from a major or collector road may
be necessary for two or more adjoining lots, the Planning Board may
require that such lots be served by a common access driveway in order
to limit the possible traffic hazard on such street. Any such driveways,
where permitted, shall be designed in compliance with § 113-31 hereof.
[Amended 2-9-1993 by L.L. No. 4-1993]
E. Double-frontage lots. Lots fronting on two streets, other than corner
lots, shall be avoided except where deemed essential by the Planning
Board in order to provide separation of residential development from
major or collector streets or to overcome problems of topography or
orientation. The Planning Board may require access limitations and/or
buffer landscaping for such double-frontage lots where the Board
determines that such measures would be appropriate.
F. Water bodies. If a subdivision contains a water body or portion thereof,
lot lines shall be drawn so as to distribute the entire ownership of the
water body among the fees of the adjacent lots, unless the Planning
Board approves an alternate plan whereby the ownership of and
responsibility for the safety of the water body is so placed that it will not
become a Town responsibility.
G. Access across a watercourse. Where a watercourse separates the
buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provision
shall be made for the installation of a bridge, culvert or other drainage
facility, of a design approved by the Planning Board based upon
recommendation of the Town Engineer, to provide satisfactory access
across such watercourse for fire, police and other emergency
equipment.
H. Subdivisions with land in two or more zoning districts or municipalities.
(1) In general, a lot should not be divided by a zoning district or
municipal boundary. If it is, however, necessary for a zoning district
boundary to cross a lot, such lot shall be designed so that it can be
readily developed in accordance with the standards of the more
restrictive zoning district. If it is necessary for a municipal
§ 113-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 113-30
1:713
§ 113-31. Common access driveways. [Added 2-9-1993 by L.L. No.
4-199390]
boundary line to cross a lot, the Planning Board may require
suitable legal agreements to assure that the two portions of the lot
will not be separated in the future and that the portion of the lot
in the adjoining municipality will not be used for any purpose that
would make it nonconforming if the entire lot were located within
the Town of New Castle.
(2) Whenever a subdivision includes land in two or more zoning
districts and/or municipalities, the location of the zoning district
and/or municipal boundary line shall be shown on the plat and, in
addition, where zoning boundaries are involved, the following
notation shall be added: "Existing zoning boundaries as of
.............., 19 ...."
A. Where the Planning Board determines that it would be appropriate for
traffic safety, environmental conservation or other similar public
purposes, as set forth in this chapter and/or the Town Development
Plan, for two or more lots to be served by a shared driveway, it may
require that access to such lots be by means of a single common access
driveway and shall be responsible for approving its design and location.
Except as set forth below, no more than three lots may be served by
such a single common access driveway. In unusual circumstances
arising out of the Planning Board's desire to further advance the
objectives set forth above, said Board may permit up to four lots to be
served by a common access driveway. Vehicular traveled ways serving
more than four lots shall be designed and constructed in accordance
with the requirements of § 113-24G hereof.
B. Design and construction standards for common access driveways.
Common access driveways shall meet the design and construction
standards set forth in Appendix II hereof.91 The Planning Board may
vary the standards specified therein only where it finds that, owing to
traffic safety, environmental or other specific characteristics of the site,
strict compliance with said standards is not in the public interest.
C. Additional requirements for common access driveways. As a condition
of Planning Board approval, the applicant shall be required to submit in
recordable form satisfactory to the Town Counsel an instrument
establishing the access easement(s) over and providing for the
maintenance of the common access driveway(s).
90.Editor's Note: This local law also provided that former §§ 113-31 through 113-36 be
redesignated as §§ 113-32 through 113-37, respectively.

1:714
§ 113-32. Reservations and easements.
All reservations and easements shall be clearly indicated on the final
subdivision plat, along with appropriate notations indicating the rights
which exist with respect to each such reservation and/or easement.
A. Park reservations. [Amended 9-12-1995 by L.L. No. 9-1995]
(1) General standards. Consistent with the provisions of § 277 of the
Town Law, in a proper case the Planning Board may require that
land be reserved within subdivisions for a park or parks suitably
located for playground or other recreational purposes. Such
locations shall be as designated on the Town Development Plan or
Official Map or as otherwise deemed appropriate by the Planning
Board. Each reservation shall be of suitable size, dimensions,
topography and general character and shall have adequate street
access for the particular purpose or purposes envisioned by the
Planning Board. The area shall be shown and marked on the plat as
"Reserved for Park Purposes."
(2) Minimum size.
(a) Where the reservation of park areas is required, the Planning
Board shall determine the minimum acreage to be reserved
from the following table:
Zoning District
Minimum Percentage of Land in
Subdivision to be Reserved for
Park Purposes
(acres)
R-2A 3
R-1A 5
R-1/2A 8
R-1/4A 12
(b) In general, sites reserved for park purposes shall have an area
of at least three acres. The Planning Board may require the
location of such areas along the boundary of a subdivision so
that additional land may be added at such time as the adjacent
property is subdivided.
(3) Ownership of park areas. The ownership of reservations for park
purposes shall be clearly indicated on the plat and established in a
manner satisfactory to the Planning Board so as to assure their
proper future continuation and maintenance.
(4) Cash payment in lieu of reservation. Consistent with the provisions
of § 277 of the Town Law, in a proper case where the Planning
Board determines that a suitable park or parks of adequate size
cannot be properly located in a subdivision or where such a
§ 113-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 113-32
1:715
reservation is otherwise not appropriate or practical, the Board
may require, as a condition to approval of any such plat, a payment
to the Town of a sum determined for such cases by the Town
Board. Such fee shall be set forth by resolution of the Town Board
in the Master Fee Schedule, which may be amended. [Amended
9-10-2002 by L.L. No. 8-2002]
B. Widening or realignment of existing streets. Where a subdivision
borders an existing street which is narrower than the recommended
right-of-way width as specified for such streets in these regulations or
where a subdivision borders an existing street planned for widening or
realignment in such a way as to require the use of some land in the
subdivision, the Planning Board may require the subdivision plat to
show such areas, which shall be marked "Reserved for Street
Realignment (or Widening) Purposes." Land reserved for such purposes
may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance.92
C. Utility and drainage easements.
(1) Where topographic or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of utilities or drainage facilities within
street rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15
feet in width shall be provided for such utilities or drainage
facilities across properties outside the street lines and with
satisfactory access to the street. Drainage easements shall extend
from the street to the watercourse or other drainage facility and
shall convey to the holder of fee title of the street the perpetual
right to discharge stormwater runoff from the street and the
surrounding area onto and over the affected premises by means of
pipes, culverts or ditches, or a combination thereof, together with
the right to enter said premises for the purpose of making such
installations and doing such maintenance work as the holder of
such fee title may deem necessary to adequately drain the street
and the surrounding area.
(2) When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be
secured in a form satisfactory to the Town Attorney and suitable for
recording in the office of the County Clerk.
D. Slope easements. Where determined appropriate by the Planning
Board, said Board may permit an embankment alongside a proposed
street to extend beyond the normal right-of-way of such street, provided
that a slope easement is granted, conveying to the holder of fee title of
the street the right to enter the premises for the purpose of maintaining
such slope. Where the embankment slope is located on private land
outside the subdivision, such easement shall be permitted only where
the appropriate rights have been secured in a form satisfactory to the
92.Editor's Note: See Ch. 60, Zoning.
§ 113-32 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 113-32
1:716
§ 113-33. Self-imposed restrictions.
The subdivider may place restrictions on any of the land contained within
the subdivision which are greater than those required by the Zoning
Ordinance.93 Such restrictions shall be indicated on the final subdivision
plat.
Town Attorney and suitable for recording in the office of the County
Clerk.
E. Sight easements. Sight easements shall be provided across all street
corners, outside the street right-of-way, within the triangular area
formed by the nearest edges of street pavement and a straight line
between two points each 75 feet back from the theoretical intersection
of the edges of such pavement prolonged. The easements shall provide
that the holder of fee title to the abutting streets shall have the right to
enter the easement area for the purpose of clearing, pruning or
regrading so as to maintain a clear line of sight in either direction
across such triangular area between an observer's eye 3.5 feet above
the pavement surface on one street and an object one foot above the
pavement surface on the other. The initial establishment of clear sight
lines within the sight easement area shall be the responsibility of the
subdivider.
F. Easements for pedestrian access. The Planning Board may require, in
order to facilitate pedestrian access from streets to schools, parks or
neighboring areas, the reservation of perpetual unobstructed
easements at least 10 feet in width for such purposes and the
construction of walkways thereon.

Chapter 114
TATTOOING
§ 114-1. Findings.
The Town Board has noted that § 260.21 of the Penal Law provides that it
is a misdemeanor to mark the body of a child less than 18 years old with
indelible ink or pigments by means of tattooing. It is also the experience
of the Town of New Castle Police Department that prohibitions of certain
activities based solely on age prove difficult and impractical to enforce
and that the Town lacks the resources and personnel to properly supervise
these age limited activities. In addition, there is evidence that the practice
of tattooing, when improperly done and state guidelines are not followed,
can create health risks, particularly of serum hepatitis. However, the Town
lacks the resources to implement and staff an effective regulatory scheme
of licensing and inspection of tattoo establishments. Accordingly, the Town
Board finds that, in this Town, the enforcement of the above-referenced
provision of the Penal Law is difficult and impractical and the Town cannot
effectively license and monitor tattoo establishments. Therefore, as a means
to protect the public, the Town finds it necessary to impose a ban on this
commercial activity.
§ 114-2. Prohibited activities; exceptions.
It shall be unlawful for any person to tattoo a human being within the
Town of New Castle for pay or compensation of any kind, except that
tattooing may be performed for medical purposes by a person licensed or
otherwise authorized pursuant to the Education Law to practice medicine
or osteopathy.
§ 114-3. Penalties for offenses.
An offense against the provisions of this chapter shall be punishable by
a fine not exceeding $350 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed
six months, or both, for conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a
second offense, both of which were committed within a period of five years,
punishable by a fine not less than $350 nor more than $700 or imprisonment
for a period not to exceed six months, or both; and, upon conviction for a
third or subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a period of
five years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than $1,000
or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both. However,
for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and judicial officers
generally, violations of this chapter shall be deemed misdemeanors, and for
such purpose only all provisions of law relating to misdemeanors shall apply
to such violations.

A. If the income of the owner or the combined income of the owners of the
property for the income tax year immediately preceding the date of
making application for exemption exceeds the sum of the maximum
income exemption eligibility level for the granting of partial exemption
from real property taxation as provided herein. "Income tax year" shall
mean the twelve-month period for which the owner or owners filed a
federal personal income tax return or, if no such return is filed, the
calendar year where title is vested in either the husband or the wife,
their combined income may not exceed such sum. Such income shall
include social security and retirement benefits, interest, dividends,
total gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset which may be
offset by a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset in the same
income tax year, net rental income, salary or earnings and net income
from self-employment, but shall not include a return of capital, gifts or
inheritances. In computing net rental income and net income from selfemployment,
no depreciation deduction shall be allowed for the
exhaustion, wear and tear of real or personal property held for the
production of income.
B. Unless the title of the property shall have been vested in the owner or
one of the owners of the property for at least 24 consecutive months
prior to the date of making application for exemption; provided,
however, that in the event of the death of either a husband or wife in
whose name title of the property shall have been vested at the time of
death and then becomes vested solely in the survivor by virtue of devise
or by descent from the deceased husband or wife, the time of ownership
of the property by the deceased husband or wife shall be deemed also a
time of ownership by the survivor and such ownership shall be deemed
continuous for the purposes of computing such period of 24 consecutive
months, provided, further, that in the event of a transfer by either a
husband or wife to the other spouse of all or part of the title to the
property, the time of ownership of the property by the transferor spouse
shall be deemed also a time of ownership by the transferee spouse and
such ownership shall be deemed continuous for the purposes of
computing such period of 24 consecutive months and, provided, further,
§ 116-2 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 116-3
1:734
§ 116-4. Exemption to be continued after death of spouse.
The real property tax exemption provided for herein on real property owned
by husband and wife, one of whom is 65 years of age or over, once granted,
shall not be rescinded solely because of the death of the older spouse so
long as the surviving spouse is at least 62 years of age.
§ 116-5. Application for exemption. [Amended 5-8-2018 by L.L. No.
8-2018]
that where property of the owner or owners has been acquired to
replace property formerly owned by such owner or owners and taken
by eminent domain or other involuntary proceeding, except a tax sale,
the period of ownership of the former property shall be combined with
the period of ownership of the property for which application is made
for exemption and such periods of ownership shall be deemed to be
consecutive for purposes of this section. Where a residence is sold and
replaced with another within one year and is in the same assessing
unit or municipality, the period of ownership of the former property
shall be combined with the period of ownership of the replacement
residence and deemed consecutive for exemption from taxation by each
such assessing unit or municipality; provided, however, that where the
replacement property is in the same assessing unit but in another
school district, the period of ownership of both properties shall also
be deemed consecutive for purposes of the exemption from taxation
by such school district. Notwithstanding any other provision of law,
where a residence is sold and replaced with another within one year
and both residences are within the state, the period of ownership
of both properties shall be deemed consecutive for purposes of the
exemption from taxation by a municipality within the state granting
such exemption.
C. Unless the property is used exclusively for residential purposes.
D. Unless the real property is the legal residence of and is occupied in
whole or in part by the owner or by all of the owners of the property.
A. Application for such exemption must be made by the owner or all of the
owners of the property on forms prescribed by the State Board to be
furnished by the Assessor of the Town of New Castle (the "Assessor")
and shall furnish the information and be executed in the manner
required or prescribed in such forms and shall be filed in such
Assessor's office on or before the Town's taxable status date.
B. Notwithstanding Subdivision 5 of § 467 of the Real Property Tax Law, an
application for such exemption may be filed with the Assessor after the
appropriate taxable status date, but not later than the last date on
which a petition with respect to complaints of assessments may be filed,
where failure to file a timely application results from death of the
applicant's spouse, child, parent, brother or sister; or an illness of the
applicant or of the applicant's spouse, child, parent, brother or sister
§ 116-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 116-5
1:735
which actually prevents the applicant from filing on a timely basis,
as certified by a licensed physician. In such case, the Assessor shall
approve or deny such application as if it had been filed on or before the
taxable status date.
C. The Assessor is hereby authorized to accept applications for renewal of
exemptions granted under this chapter after the taxable status date. In
the event that the owner or all of the owners of property which have
received an exemption pursuant to this article on the preceding
assessment roll shall fail to file an application for renewal on or before
the taxable status date, such owner or owners may file the application,
executed as if such application had been filed on or before the taxable
status date, with the Assessors on or before the date for the hearing of
complaints.
D. Where a person who meets the requirement for an exemption pursuant
to this chapter purchases property after the levy of taxes, such person
may file an application for exemption to the Assessor within 30 days of
the transfer of title to such person. The Assessor shall make a
determination of whether the person would have qualified for exempt
status on the tax roll on which the taxes were levied, had title to the
parcel been in the name of the applicant on the taxable status date
applicable to the tax roll. The application shall be on a form prescribed
by the State Board. The Assessor, no later than 30 days after receipt of
such application, shall notify both the applicant and the Board of
Assessment Review, by first class mail, of the exempt amount, if any,
and the right of the owner to a review of the exempt amount upon the
filing of a written complaint. Such complaint shall be on a form
prescribed by the State Board and shall be filed with the Board of
Assessment Review within 20 days of the mailing of this notice. If no
complaint is received, the Board of Assessment Review shall so notify
the Assessor, and the exempt amount determined by the Assessor shall
be final. If the applicant files a complaint, the Board of Assessment
Review shall schedule a time and a place for the hearing with respect
thereto no later than 30 days after the mailing of the notice by the
Assessor. The Board of Assessment Review shall meet and determine
the exempt amount and shall immediately notify the Assessor and the
applicant, by first class mail, of its determination. The amount of the
exemption determined pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to
review as provided in Article 7 of the Real Property Tax Law. Such a
proceeding shall be commenced within 30 days of the mailing of the
notice of the Board of Assessment Review to the new owner as provided
in this subsection. Upon receipt of a determination of exempt amount as
provided in this subsection, the Assessor shall determine the pro rata
exemption to be credited toward such property by multiplying the tax
rate for the Town of New Castle on the appropriate tax roll used for the
fiscal year or years during which the transfer occurred times the
exempt amount, as determined pursuant to this subsection, times the
fraction of each fiscal year or years remaining subsequent to the
transfer of title. The Assessor shall immediately transmit a statement of
§ 116-5 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 116-5
1:736
the pro rata exemption to the applicant. The Town of New Castle shall
include an appropriation in its budget for the next fiscal year equal to
the aggregate amount of such credits to be applied in that fiscal year.
Where a parcel, the owner of which is entitled to a pro rata exemption
credit, is subject to taxation in said next fiscal year, the receiver or
collector shall apply the credit to reduce the amount of taxes owed for
the parcel in such fiscal year. Pro rata exemption credits in excess of
the amount of taxes, if any, owed for the parcel shall be paid by the
Treasurer of the Town of New Castle to all owners of property entitled
to such credits within 30 days of the expiration of the warrant to collect
taxes in said next fiscal year.
E. Where a person who meets the requirements for an exemption pursuant
to this chapter purchases property after the taxable status date but
prior to the levy of taxes, such person may file an application for an
exemption to the Assessor within 30 days of the transfer of title to such
person. The Assessor shall make a determination within 30 days after
receipt of such application of whether the applicant would qualify for an
exemption pursuant to this chapter on the assessment roll if title had
been in the name of the applicant on the taxable status date applicable
to such assessment roll. The application shall be made on a form
prescribed by the State Board. If the Assessor's determination is made
prior to the filing of the tentative assessment roll, the Assessor shall
enter the exempt amount, if any, on the tentative assessment roll and,
within 10 days after filing such roll, notify the applicant of the approval
or denial of such exemption, the exempt amount, if any, and the
applicant's right to review by the Board of Assessment Review. If the
Assessor's determination is made after the filing of the tentative
assessment roll, the Assessor shall petition the Board of Assessment
Review to correct the tentative or final assessment roll in the manner
provided in Title 3 of Article 5 of the Real Property Tax Law, with
respect to the unlawful entries, in the case of wholly exempt parcels,
and with respect to clerical errors, in the case of partially exempt
parcels, if the Assessor determines that an exemption should be
granted and, within 10 days of petitioning the Board of Assessment
Review, notify the applicant of the approval or denial of such exemption,
the amount of such exemption, if any, and the applicant's right to
administrative or judicial review of such determination pursuant to
Article 5 or 7 of the Real Property Tax Law, respectively.
F. If, for any reason, a determination to exempt property from taxation as
provided in Subsection E of this section is not entered on the final
assessment roll, the Assessor shall petition the Board of Assessment
Review to correct the final assessment roll.
G. If, for any reason, the pro rata tax credit as provided in Subsection D of
this section is not extended against the tax roll immediately succeeding
the fiscal year during which the transfer occurred, the Assessor shall
immediately notify the Town of New Castle of the amount of pro rata
exemption credits for the year in which such transfer occurred.
§ 116-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 116-5
1:737
§ 116-6. Property owners to be notified. [Amended 5-8-2018 by L.L.
No. 8-2018]
H. If, for any reason, a determination to exempt property from taxation as
provided in Subsection E of this section is not entered on the tax roll for
the year immediately succeeding the fiscal year during which the
transfer occurred, the Assessor shall determine the pro rata tax
exemption credit for such tax roll by multiplying the tax rate for the
Town of New Castle by the exempt amount and shall immediately notify
the Town of New Castle of the pro rata exemption credits for such tax
roll. The Town of New Castle shall add such pro rata exemption credits
for such property to any outstanding pro rata exemption amounts.
A. The Town of New Castle shall notify or cause to be notified each person
owning residential real property in the Town of New Castle of the
provisions hereof. Such notice may be met by a notice or legend sent on
or with each tax bill to such persons, reading substantially as follows:
"SENIOR CITIZENS: If your annual income is less than [insert New
York State maximum eligible income level], you may be eligible for
senior citizen tax exemption. Senior citizens have until June 1 of each
year to apply for such exemption. For information, please call or write
the Assessor's Office, Town of New Castle, 200 South Greeley Avenue,
Chappaqua, New York 10514, telephone (914) 238-4722 or via email at
assessor@mynewcastle.org."
B. At least 60 days prior to the appropriate taxable status date, the
Assessor shall mail to each person who was granted a senior citizen
exemption on the latest completed assessment roll an application form
and a notice that such application must be filed on or before taxable
status date and be approved in order for the exemption to be granted.
The Assessor shall, within three days of the completion and filing of the
tentative assessment roll, notify by mail any applicant who has included
with his application at least one self-addressed, prepaid envelope of the
approval or denial of the application; provided, however, that the
Assessor shall, upon the receipt and filing of the application, send by
mail notification of receipt to any applicant who has included two of
such envelopes with the application. Where an applicant is entitled to a
notice of denial pursuant to this section, such notice shall be on a form
prescribed by the State Board and shall state the reasons for such
denial and shall further state that the applicant may have such
determination reviewed in the manner provided by law.
C. Failure to notify or cause to be notified any person who is in fact eligible
to receive the exemption or the failure to mail any such application form
or notices or the failure of such person to receive any of the same shall
not prevent the levy, collection and enforcement of the payment of the
taxes on property owned by such person.
D. Any person who has been granted exemption pursuant to this chapter
on five consecutive completed assessment rolls, including any years
when the exemption was granted to a property owned by a husband

The exemption provided herein shall apply to school taxes, provided that
the applicable school districts shall have, prior to the taxable status date
occurring on or after January 1, 1984, adopted a resolution pursuant to
§§ 467 and 467-d of the Real Property Tax Law101 providing for such
exemption. Notwithstanding such resolution, the exemption from taxation
for school tax purposes shall not be granted in the case of real property
where a child resides if such child attends a public school of elementary or
secondary education.

and/or wife while both resided in such property, shall not be subject
to application requirements set forth in this chapter. However, said
person shall be mailed an application form and a notice informing him
of his rights. Such exemption shall be automatically granted on each
subsequent assessment roll; provided, however, that when tax payment
is made by such person a sworn affidavit must be included with such
payment and which shall state that such persons continue to be eligible
for such exemption. Such affidavit shall be on a form prescribed by the
State Board. If such affidavit is not included with the tax payment, the
collecting officer shall proceed pursuant to § 551-a of the Real Property
Tax Law.
A. Any conviction of having made any willful false statement in the
application for such exemption shall be punishable by a fine of not more
than $100 and shall disqualify the applicant or applicants from further
exemption for a period of five years.
B. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions hereof, the collection of
any amount of tax erroneously exempted due to an incorrect statement
in an application for exemption shall be enforceable in the same
manner provided for the collection of delinquent taxes pursuant to the
provisions of Article 10 of the Real Property Tax Law.
C. Any fine levied pursuant to Subsection A of this section shall be paid to

§ 121-1. Legislative intent.
The Town of New Castle finds and declares that the preservation of trees
within the Town is necessary to protect the health, safety and general
welfare of the Town of New Castle because trees provide shade, impede
soil erosion, aid water absorption and retention, inhibit excess runoff and
flooding, enhance air quality, offer a natural barrier to noise, provide a
natural habitat for wildlife, provide screening, enhance property values and
add to the aesthetic quality of the community. Trees also can reduce airconditioning
costs by providing shade and can reduce cooling and heating
costs by serving as windbreaks, resulting in energy efficiency for the
heating of buildings. Trees reduce levels of carbon dioxide and return
oxygen to the atmosphere, and buffer views of development. By maintaining
the existing character of the Town, they enhance property values and
contribute to the significance of historic buildings, structures and places in
the Town. Trees serve as an amenity that satisfies residents' psychological
and aesthetic needs.

in such escrow account is reduced to 1/3 of its initial amount, the
applicant shall deposit additional funds into such account to
restore the balance in such account to the amount of the initial
deposit. If such account is not replenished in 30 days after the
applicant is notified, in writing, of the requirements for such
additional deposit, the Board may suspend its review of the
application. A building permit or certificate of occupancy or use
shall not be issued unless all professional consultant review fees

incorporate at least three separate tree genera whereby no single tree
genus accounts for more than 33% of all newly planted trees.

VACANT STOREFRONT REGISTRY
§ 122A-1. Legislative purpose and findings.
§ 122A-2. Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:
A. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to promote the health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the Town of New Castle by encouraging
the rehabilitation and reoccupancy of vacant storefronts in the Town.
B. Findings. It is hereby determined that:
(1) The presence of vacant storefronts can adversely affect the
desirability of the immediate and neighboring areas, discourage
buyers from purchasing property within the Town, prevent the
most appropriate use and development of properties, and
contribute to the diminution of the taxable value of property in such
areas and their ability to support the municipal services provided
therefor.
(2) One empty storefront on a block can lead to more vacancies and
diminish the value and appeal of the surrounding commercial area.
(3) Small businesses, in particular, rely on a vibrant commercial
corridor to attract customers.
(4) It is in the best interest of the Town of New Castle to encourage
owners of vacant storefront properties to lease or otherwise utilize
such properties in a productive manner rather than allowing them
to remain vacant.
(5) A vacant storefront registry will help drive economic development
by helping potential small business owners locate contact
information and locations of vacant storefronts.

(1) Within 24 hours of removal and storage, the Police Department
shall to the extent possible:
(a) Ascertain the identity and address of the registered owner of
such vehicle; and
(b) Notify that registered owner of:
[1] The removal and storage of such vehicle.
[2] The amount of any payment or bond required under
Subsection E(2) below for release of the vehicle.
[3] The registered owner's right to a hearing under
Subsection E(3) below.
(2) Such vehicle shall be released to its registered owner, or to its
registered owner's authorized representative or operator of the
vehicle, upon either payment of the reasonable costs of removal
and storage and any outstanding fines and penalties charged with
respect to such vehicle or the posting of a cash bond for the same.
The desk officer on duty at the New Castle Police Station shall be
authorized to accept such cash bond in an amount determined by
the Court or Court Clerk and shall promptly transmit any cash bond
posted to the Town Court.
(3) The registered owner of such vehicle shall be entitled to a hearing
before an administrative hearing board to determine whether such
removal and storage was warranted. Such an administrative
hearing shall be held within 48 hours of receipt by the Police
Department of a written request for the same; the hearing board
shall consist of the Town Administrator, the Deputy Supervisor and
an elected official designated by the Town Supervisor; and the
registered owner and such registered owner's authorized
representatives and operators of the vehicle shall be given an
opportunity to be heard. If the hearing board determines that such
removal and storage was not warranted, such vehicle shall be
released to its registered owner, or to its registered owner's
authorized representative or operator of the vehicle, without any
payment or bonding otherwise required under Subsection E(2), and
if any such bonding was posted previously, that bonding shall be
refunded.
F. Except in the case of a vehicle with a parking permit, there shall be a
rebuttable presumption that the owner of a vehicle was the operator of
such vehicle at the time of the issuance of a summons for a violation in
connection with any provision of this article relating to parking of a
motor vehicle. This presumption may be rebutted by credible evidence
that the owner was not in possession or control of the vehicle at the
time it was parked. [Added 6-12-2007 by L.L. No. 10-2007]

G. In the case of a vehicle with a parking permit, there shall be a
rebuttable presumption that the person to whom the parking permit
has been issued was the operator of such vehicle at the time of the
issuance of a summons for a violation in connection with any provision
of this article relating to parking of a motor vehicle. This presumption
may be rebutted by credible evidence that the person to whom the
parking permit has been issued was not in possession or control of the
vehicle at the time it was parked. In the event this presumption has
been successfully rebutted, there shall be a second rebuttable
presumption that the owner of a vehicle was the operator of such
vehicle at the time of the issuance of a summons for a violation in
connection with any provision of this article relating to parking of a
motor vehicle. This presumption may be rebutted by credible evidence
that the owner was not in possession or control of the vehicle at the
time it was parked. [Added 6-12-2007 by L.L. No. 10-2007]
A. Upon five days' written notice, the Town Clerk may revoke a permit if it
is determined that a permit has been issued based upon false or
misleading information given by the permit holder or if it is determined
that a permit has been used in violation of this article. Upon such
revocation, the permit fee shall be forfeited. Such revocation shall be
effective for the then remainder of the current permit year and the
following permit year. Any parking permit which is revoked shall be
returned to the Town Clerk within five days of such revocation or within
five days of a determination by the administrative hearing board
confirming such revocation. The penalty for failure to return such
revoked parking permit shall be $25. Failure to pay such penalty for a
period exceeding 20 days from the date of issuance of notice to the
permit holder that the penalty is due shall result in a penalty of $50.
B. Revocation of a permit may be appealed by the permit holder within 15
days of such revocation to an administrative hearing board, which shall
consist of the Town Administrator, the Town Chief of Police and the
Town Supervisor or an elected official designated by the Supervisor.
Such administrative hearing board shall decide on the appeal whether
or not such revocation is warranted. However, conviction of any
provision of this article shall be prima facie evidence of grounds
sufficient for revocation of a permit.
C. A nonresident who displays a permit that has been issued to a resident
on a vehicle owned or registered to such nonresident shall constitute
grounds for revocation of such resident's permit and grounds for
denying such nonresident a parking permit in the future.

A. The Town Board finds that significant numbers of persons fail to
respond to summonses issued for violations of parking rules pertaining
to restricted parking areas contained in Article IX of this chapter, and
that a significant number of such persons are persistent violators of
Article IX of this chapter.
B. By reason of the foregoing, the Town Board finds that the health,
welfare and safety will be served by adoption of a local law providing
additional means of enforcing parking orders, rules and regulations in
the case of persons who fail to timely respond to summonses issued for
violations of Article IX of this chapter or are persistent violators of
Article IX of this chapter.
C. The Town Board does hereby enact this article to accomplish the
aforesaid purposes.
A. The Justice Court shall establish a Scofflaw List which shall consist of
all vehicles known to have three or more parking summonses for
violations of Article IX of this chapter which are outstanding, unpaid or
otherwise unanswered for 60 days after the date of the third summons.
The Justice Court shall issue or cause to be issued a one-time notice
addressed to the owner of record for any vehicle added to the Town
Scofflaw List, which notice shall: (i) inform the owner that his or her
vehicle may be immobilized without further notice if found parked on a
public street or on publicly owned or controlled real property within the
Town; and (ii) provide contact information for reclaiming said vehicle in
the event it is immobilized in the future. Thereafter, the Chief of Police
is authorized to order the immobilization of said vehicle added to the
Town Scofflaw List, where such vehicle is found parked whether legally
or illegally, on any public right-of-way or on any other publicly owned or
controlled property in the Town of New Castle.
B. Such vehicles may be immobilized and left where found, secured by the
use of a wheel lock or such other immobilization device as may be
designated by the Chief of Police.
C. Such immobilization shall be at the sole expense of the owner of the
vehicle.

Police, a notice containing the following information:
§ 123-36.5. Tampering with or attempted removal of immobilization
devices.
No person shall attempt to or shall tamper with, deface, remove or destroy

E. The steps which the owner must take to obtain the release of the
vehicle, including the right to a post-immobilization hearing.
F. Notice that the Town may tow and impound the vehicle without further
notice if, after expiration of three days' time from the date of
immobilization, the owner of the vehicle does not make necessary
arrangements for the release of the vehicle.
G. Such other information, statements, notices and warnings as the Chief
of Police may, from time to time, determine to be appropriate.
A. If after three days any vehicle that has been immobilized has not been
released to its owner, such vehicle shall be impounded by, or under the
direction of, a member of the Police Department by towing or
otherwise. Such vehicle shall be released to its owner in accordance
with § 123-36.7.
B. It shall be the duty of the Police Department, within 24 hours of such
towing or impoundment, to ascertain to the extent possible the owner of
the vehicle and to notify such person of the immobilization, removal and
impoundment of such vehicle, and of the amount which will be required
to redeem the same.
A. Any person seeking to redeem a vehicle immobilized or impounded
pursuant to this chapter must first pay all outstanding penalties, fines

B. In lieu of payment of the above-described charges, the owner of such
vehicle can post a cash bond in the full amount of all penalties, fines and
fees owed for all outstanding parking violations, plus all booting,
towing, storage, impoundment and administrative charges and fees
charged against the vehicle. The desk officer on duty at the New Castle
Police Station shall be authorized to accept such cash bond in an
amount determined by the court or Court Clerk, together with the
expense of immobilization and/or impoundment. In determining the
amount of such security, consideration shall be given to the likelihood of
the vehicle owner appearing in Town Court to answer outstanding
summonses and the number of outstanding summonses involved. The
amount of such security shall not exceed the total of the maximum fines
permitted upon conviction of the offenses charged in the outstanding
summonses against the vehicle, plus the expense or immobilization and/
or impoundment. Security payments shall be promptly transmitted to
the Town Court.

impounded or immobilized, the administrative hearing board
established pursuant to Article IX of this chapter shall hear an appeal
from such charges. Such hearing will be held within 48 hours of such
request, and the owner shall be given an opportunity to be heard before
the administrative hearing board.
B. The administrative hearing board shall decide on the appeal whether or
not such immobilization or impoundment was warranted. The
administrative hearing board's determination shall not be
determinative of or adjudicate any citation issued relative to any
impounded vehicle.

Liability of Water District
§ 131-40. District not liable for damages or inadequate service.
[Amended 6-25-1974]
§ 131-41. Control of equipment reserved; no liability for breaks.
[Amended 6-25-1974]
The Water Department reserves to itself the control of all taps, mains,
curb stops and meters. It also reserves the right, whenever the Water
Department deems it proper or whenever there is a violation of the rules
and regulations, to take charge of and control the service pipes. The Water
Department will not be accountable for any breaks or obstructions caused
by frost or otherwise nor for any damage arising by leakage from service
pipes, fixtures or pipes owned by individuals. The Water Department will
not thaw out or pay for the thawing out of frozen service lines.
A. The water district shall not be liable for any damages which may result
to owners' pipes, appliances, etc., from the shutting off of water mains
or service pipes for any purposes whatever, whether previous notice
has been given or not. In cases where boilers are directly supplied with
water, a suitable valve or other device should be applied to prevent
collapse or explosion in case the water is shut off in the street mains or
the supply is interrupted due to breaks. No deductions from water bills
will be made for periods when the service is shut off due to accidents or
repairs. The water district shall not be held liable for any damage
sustained by reason of its failure to supply water to any consumer at
any time or for any cause, and reserves the right to control the amount
of water supplied in the event that the supply becomes short for any
reason. Owners in high areas are particularly warned to provide against
damage caused by water siphoning back into the mains.
B. The water district does not guarantee service from main to house or
through any piping, valves or connections therein. Faulty service or
inadequate supply is frequently due to corroding or stopping of pipes
and fixtures. Any necessary extending of mains or changes in piping,
valves or connections to increase the water supply or its efficiency must
be paid by the owner at his own expense.

ARTICLE IX
Liability of Owner
§ 131-42. Maintenance and repair. [Amended 6-25-1974]
The owner must keep the service pipes from main to building, curb boxes
and his plumbing fixtures in good repair, and at his own expense must
prevent all unnecessary waste of water. Owners shall be liable for such
repairs as may be deemed necessary to prevent water waste. Upon failure
of the owner to comply with this rule, the Water Department may turn off
the water and not turn it on again until the repairs are made. Owners are
warned that high pressures are maintained in some parts of the district, and
the installation of a pressure-reducing valve may be advisable. The owner is
liable for any accidents due to curb boxes protruding above grade.

owner, the owner shall be billed at the schedule rates for each meter
independently, giving due effect to the minimum charge.
C. New subscribers coming during a quarter need pay only the
consumption charge and not the minimum for the balance of the
quarter.
D. Water for building construction will be charged at a flat rate depending
upon the type and size of the building, the minimum charge for a new
building shall be as set forth by resolution of the Town Board in the
Master Fee Schedule, which may be amended. The Water Department
reserves the right to regulate the purpose for which the water may be
used during construction and may, at its option, require the water to be
metered. No water shall be obtained from the mains of the Water
Department for any purpose except properly authorized building
construction or through a metered service. When meters are furnished
for temporary service, a deposit will be required, to be fixed by the
Water Department in each case. All consumers outside the water
district will be charged a special rate as set forth by the Town Board.
[Amended 9-10-2002 by L.L. No. 8-2002]

Water bills become due at the end of each billing period. All bills for water
are due and payable when rendered. The payment of water bills must
include all arrears and charges to date, although acceptance of partial
payment of a bill will not be deemed a waiver of any balance due, including
penalties and arrears. Water bills are a lien on the property. The Water
Department may enforce the collection of water rates by cutting off the
supply of water when any bill is 60 days in arrears. A charge in accordance
with the Charge Schedule adopted by the Board as amended from time to
time will be added to all bills not paid within 30 days after they become due.
§ 131-45. Owner responsible for payment. [Amended 6-25-1974]
All water charges must be paid by the owner of the premises. If requested
by the applicant herein, the Water Department will send bills to and receive
payments from agents or tenants. It should be noted, however, that the
owner is responsible for the payment of charges for water furnished
hereunder and is responsible for any delinquency in the matter of payments
by tenants or others.

ARTICLE XIII
Suggestions to Water Consumers
§ 131-47. Stopping of leaks.
A leak the size of a pencil point will waste more water than a family of five
persons needs; therefore, it is to your interest to stop all leaks, no matter
how small they appear to be. Leaks in toilet fixtures are largely the cause
of high water bills. To determine whether or not your plumbing fixtures are
in good order, stop the flow of water from all openings; if the meter is in
proper working condition, the lowest denomination will continue to move in
case there is leakage.

§ 131-64. Responsibilities.
§ 131-65. Administrative procedures; inspections; discontinuance.
A. Water Department. The Commissioner is responsible to ensure that
water of questionable or unsuitable quality does not enter the public
water supply system. The Commissioner shall determine the degree of
hazard that a consumer facility poses to the district water system and
shall require that a suitable backflow prevention containment device be
installed, tested, operated and maintained and that adequate record of
maintenance and repair be kept.
B. Owner.
(1) The owner or user of water from the system of the Water district
shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of all crossconnections
on his premises.
(2) If required by regulations adopted pursuant to this Part 3 or by
written order of the Commissioner, the owner shall, at his expense,
install, maintain and test any and all backflow prevention devices
on his premises.
(3) The owner shall install backflow prevention in a manner approved
by the Commissioner and shall periodically test all backflow
prevention devices as provided for in the Water District
Administrative Procedures and Technical Standards. Testing shall
be conducted by certified backflow prevention device testers.
A. Administrative procedures and technical standards shall be adopted by
the Town Board pursuant to resolution after public hearing. The
Commissioner will operate a cross-connection control program,
including the keeping of necessary records to fulfill the requirements of
this regulation.
B. The district, through its properly authorized agents and assistants, may
request and, upon the consent of the customer, may enter the premises
of any customer who is supplied with water to examine the pipes and
fixtures, backflow prevention devices, the quantity of water used, the
manner and nature of water used, types of stored materials, supplies
and products, processes, private wells, swimming pools, underground
lawn irrigation systems, fire sprinkler systems, solar heating systems or
any other products or processes which may endanger the quality of the
district's water supply. Alternatively, the customer may have such an
inspection performed by a professional engineer or architect licensed
and registered in New York State who would certify the results of the
inspection to the district.
§ 131-64 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 131-65
1:891
C. Water service may be discontinued by the district for refusal to grant
access for the aforementioned purposes: where the district has a
reasonable basis to believe, from the nature or use of such premises,
that a determination should be made as to the existence, nonexistence
or degree of contamination hazard; or where the activities there are
comparable or similar to those of typical establishments listed in the
State Department of Health guidelines as requiring protective devices.
However, the customer will not be subject to discontinuance if, upon the
refusal to provide access, he provides a certification by a professional
engineer or architect licensed and registered in New York that a
backflow prevention device that meets the requirements of the district
and the State Department of Health has been installed or, in the
alternative, the customer provides a certification by a professional
engineer or architect licensed and registered in New York State that
such device is unnecessary at the premises. Such certification must be
to the satisfaction of the Commissioner.
D. Upon evaluation of the inspection reports, the Commissioner will
inform the owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary,
the method of achieving the correction and the time allowed for the
correction to be made. Such irregularities disclosed shall be cause for
discontinuing service unless corrected by the consumer within 90 days
after written notice is given by the Commissioner; however, if the
Commissioner determines at any time that a serious threat to the public
health exists, the water service will be terminated immediately and
notice given to the owner as soon as reasonably practical.

Purpose and Definitions
§ 131-68. Purpose.
The purpose of this Part 4 is to protect the consumers of the Water district
from contamination to the public water supply which could result from
the interconnection of separate sources of water with the public water
supply. Further, the town finds that any interconnection would be
counterproductive to the cross-connection and backflow prevention
provisions contained in Part 3 of this chapter. Thus, the town finds that it is
necessary to regulate separate sources of water to prevent interconnections
with the water district water supply and to recover the administrative costs
associated with implementing such regulations.
§ 131-69. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BOARD  The Town Board of the Town of New Castle.
CLOSED SYSTEM  A plumbing system with no spigots, valves, faucets or
other appurtenances extending from any piping to which a connection to
another water system or supply may be made.
COMMISSIONER  The New Castle Commissioner of Public Works.
DOMESTIC POTABLE USES  A supply of water for human consumption
or other use suitable for residential use, not including irrigation and
recreational uses.
IRRIGATION USES  Irrigation uses include watering of plants, grass,
shrubbery, as well as agricultural produce and water for consumption by
livestock.
OWNER  The person or persons owning, leasing or occupying the
premises connected to or being connected to the mains in the water district,
who applies for permission to install a separate source of water as set forth
in this Part 4.
RECREATIONAL USES  Includes swimming, fishing, boating or other
recreational water related activities.
SEPARATE SOURCE OF WATER  A supply or source of water other than
from the water district or from another municipal purveyor or supplier of
water.
WATER DISTRICT  New Castle Stanwood Consolidated Water District as
same may be extended from time to time.

uses or recreational uses. The owner shall make written application to
the Commissioner for a permit for the installation of any pump, siphon,
distribution system or other facilities or equipment to utilize a separate
source of water for either domestic potable uses, irrigation uses or
recreational uses. The Commissioner shall issue the permit for use of a
separate source of water for either domestic potable uses, irrigation uses
or recreational uses, upon such terms and conditions as he may deem
appropriate to carry out the purposes and intent of this Part 4, provided that
the owner has complied with the following:
A. As to all applications pursuant to this Part 4:
(1) The owner shall obtain all required permits and approvals from the
Westchester County Department of Health.
(2) The owner shall comply with all requirements of the law, rules and
regulations of New York State, Westchester County and the
provisions of this Part 4.
(3) No direct or indirect physical connection shall be maintained or
permitted between such separate source of water and the public
water supply system of the water district.
(4) Upon compliance with all of the requirements and conditions of this
Part 4, the Commissioner shall issue to the owner a permit,
designated as a certificate of compliance, specifically referring to
the approved plans upon which said permit is based.

or distribution lines from, or uses of such separate source of water
as set forth in the certificate of compliance, without approval of the
Commissioner upon application pursuant to this Part 4.
(6) The applicant shall pay a fee at the time of submission of an
application in an amount as set forth by resolution of the Town
Board in the Master Fee Schedule, which may be amended.
[Amended 9-10-2002 by L.L. No. 8-2002]

a requirement. Any separate source of water which is not
connected to a closed system must be located and designed in such
a manner as to eliminate the possibility of a cross-connection in a
manner satisfactory to the Commissioner. In the event a separate
source of water is not connected to a closed system and the
possibility of a cross-connection is not eliminated in the opinion of
the Commissioner, such separate source of water must be tested
for potable water standards in accordance with § 131-71B.

(2) There are no direct or indirect connections to or distribution lines
from the separate source of water to the water district's public
water supply.
B. In the case of irrigation uses or recreational uses not connected to a
closed system or a system where the possibility of a cross-connection to
the water district supply has not been eliminated in the opinion of the
Commissioner, as provided for in § 131-70, the owner shall have the
separate source of water submitted for testing to a state-approved

§ 137-1. Findings; purpose.
A. The Town Board of the Town of New Castle finds and declares it to be
the public policy of the Town to preserve, protect and conserve its
wetlands, including water bodies and watercourses, and the benefits
derived therefrom, to prevent despoliation and destruction and to
regulate the use and development thereof and to secure the natural
benefits of wetlands, water bodies and watercourses consistent with
the general welfare and beneficial economic and social development of
the town. In this connection, the Town Board finds as follows:
(1) Rapid population growth, attended by housing, road and other
construction, and increasing demands upon natural resources are
found to be encroaching upon, despoiling, polluting or eliminating
many of the town's wetlands, water bodies, watercourses and other
natural resources and processes associated therewith.
(2) The preservation and maintenance of wetlands, water bodies and
watercourses in an undisturbed and natural condition constitute
important physical, ecological, social, aesthetic, recreational and
economic assets necessary to promote the health, safety and
general welfare of present and future residents of the Town and of
downstream drainage areas. In particular, wetlands serve multiple
functions, including:
(a) Protecting water resources by providing sources of surface
water, recharging groundwater and aquifers, serving as
chemical and biological oxidation basins and functioning as
settling basins for naturally occurring sedimentation.
(b) Controlling flooding and stormwater runoff by storing or
regulating natural flows.
(c) Providing nesting, migratory and wintering habitats for diverse
wildlife species, including many on the New York State and
Federal Endangered Species lists.

Words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted as defined below,
and where ambiguity exists, words or phrases shall be interpreted so as to
carry out the regulatory goals stated in § 137-1. As used in this chapter, the
following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
APPLICANT  A person requesting a wetlands permit from the Town or a
person to whom a wetlands permit has been given.
(d) Supporting vegetative associations specifically adapted for
survival in low oxygen environments.
(e) Providing areas of unusually high plant productivity which
support significant wildlife diversity and abundance.
(f) Providing breeding and spawning grounds, nursery habitat and
food for various species of fish.
(g) Serving as nutrient traps for nitrogen and phosphorus and
filters for surface water pollutants.
(h) Helping to maintain biospheric stability by supporting
particularly efficient photosynthesizers capable of producing
significant amounts of oxygen and supporting bacteria that
process excess nitrates and nitrogenous pollutants and return
them to the atmosphere as inert nitrogen gas.
(i) Providing open space and visual relief from development.
(j) Serving as outdoor laboratories and living classrooms for the
study and appreciation of natural history, ecology and biology.
(3) Considerable acreage of these important natural resources has
been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating,
building, polluting and other acts inconsistent with the natural uses
of such areas. Remaining wetlands are in jeopardy of being lost,
despoiled or impaired by such acts and the cumulative effect of
such acts, contrary to the public safety and welfare.
B. It is the intent of this chapter to promote the public purposes identified
in this section by providing for the protection, preservation, proper
maintenance and use of the town's wetlands, water bodies and
watercourses, by preventing or minimizing erosion caused by flooding
and stormwater runoff, by maintaining the natural groundwater
supplies, preserving band protecting the purity, utility, water retention
capability, ecological functions, recreational usefulness and natural
beauty of all wetlands, water bodies, watercourses and other related
features of the terrain and by providing and protecting appropriate
habitats for natural wildlife.

applicant costs shall be limited to those that are reasonable in
amount and are necessary for the Town's review and action of
the application in accordance with the law.
(2) Escrow accounts. At the time of submission of any application for
wetlands permit approval, the Planning Board may require the
establishment of an escrow account, from which withdrawals shall
be made to reimburse the Town for the cost of consultant fees and
professional staff services. The applicant shall then provide funds
to the Town for deposit into such account, in the amount to be
determined by the reviewing board based upon its evaluation of the
nature and complexity of the application. The applicant shall be
provided with copies of any Town voucher for consultant fees as
they are submitted to the Town and with Town staff time records for
which reimbursement is sought. When the balance in such escrow
account is reduced to 1/3 of its initial amount, the applicant shall
deposit additional funds into such account to restore the balance in
such account to the amount of the initial deposit. If such account is
not replenished within 30 days after the applicant is notified, in
writing, of the requirements for such additional deposit, the
reviewing board may suspend its review of the application. A
building permit or certificate of occupancy or use shall not be
issued unless all such applicants costs have been reimbursed to the
Town. After all pertinent costs have been paid, the Town shall
refund to the applicant any funds remaining on deposit.
M. A stormwater pollution prevention plan consistent with the
requirements of Chapter 108A, Stormwater Management and Erosion
and Sediment Control, shall be required for any wetlands permit
approval that qualifies as or authorizes a land development activity as
defined in Chapter 108A. The SWPPP shall meet the performance and
design criteria and standards in Chapter 108A. The approved wetlands
permit shall be consistent with the provisions of that chapter.
A. In making its determination to grant, deny or grant with conditions a
permit under this chapter, the approving authority shall consider the
following:
(1) Whether the proposed activity is consistent with the purpose and
findings of this chapter as set forth in § 137-1 hereof.
(2) The environmental impact of the proposed action.
(3) The possible or practicable alternatives to the proposed action.
§ 137-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 137-6
1:919
(4) Whether the proposed action will have a deleterious effect on the
health, safety or welfare of the residents of New Castle or its
neighboring communities.
(5) Whether the proposed action will have adequate safeguards for the
protection and preservation of the environment and for the proper
maintenance of any wetlands and the natural functions of and the
benefits derived from such areas.
(6) Whether the proposed action will have adequate safeguards
employing the best available technology to protect the potable
fresh surface and ground water supplies of the Town from drought,
pollution, overuse and other forms of misuse.
(7) Whether the proposed action has been planned, designed or
constructed so as to create minimal disturbance; to prevent or
mitigate damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; to preserve
the natural flora and fauna and their habitat; to protect against
flood and pollution of the wetlands affected; and to protect any
other benefits of wetlands as enumerated in § 137-1B hereof; and is
the best alternative available for accomplishing the proposed
action.
(8) Whether there is a practicable alternative site for the proposed
activity in another area of the subject property that is not a
wetland.
(9) Any additional information as contained in:
(a) Any statements or comments offered at or before any public
hearing.
(b) Any report from other New Castle boards and agencies and/or
federal, state or other local governmental agencies.
(c) Any additional requested information.
B. The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that the proposed
activity is not adverse to the health, safety and welfare of the residents
of New Castle or its neighboring communities and that it will not
degrade the environment or be inconsistent with the purpose of this
chapter as stated in § 137-1 hereof or, in the alternative, that the
applicant will otherwise suffer undue hardship if a permit is not issued.
C. Duly filed notice, in writing, that the state or any agency or subdivision
thereof or the Town is in the process of acquiring any wetlands by
negotiation or by condemnation shall be sufficient basis for denial of
any permit.
D. The approving authority may require the preparation of a mitigation
plan by the applicant pursuant to § 137-6F hereof when the applicant
has demonstrated that either losses or significant impacts to the
wetlands or wetlands buffer are necessary and unavoidable. For the
§ 137-6 NEW CASTLE TOWN CODE § 137-6
1:920
purposes of requiring a mitigation plan, wetlands impacts are
necessary and unavoidable only if all of the following criteria are
satisfied: [Amended 10-9-2001 by L.L. No. 5-2001]
(1) There is no feasible on-site alternative to the proposed activity,
including reduction in density, change in use, revision of road and
lot layout and related site planning considerations that could
accomplish the applicant's objectives; and
(2) There is no feasible alternative to the proposed activity on another
site available to the applicant that is not a wetlands or wetlands
buffer.
E. The approving authority shall monitor or shall cause to have monitored
projects in accordance with the specifications set forth in the permit to
determine whether the elements of the permit and/or mitigation plan
have been met. The Planning Board may contract with an academic
institution, independent research group or other qualified professionals
to assist and discharge its obligations hereunder at the expense of the
applicant. The requirements for monitoring shall be specified in the
permit and/or mitigation plan and may include, but not be limited to:
(1) The time period over which monitoring shall occur.
(2) Field measurements to verify the size and location of the impacted
wetlands area and the restored/replacement wetlands area.
(3) The date of completion of the work or restoration/replacement.
(4) Field verification of the vegetative, hydrologic and soils criteria as
specified in the permit and/or mitigation plan.
F. In the event that the approving authority so requires pursuant to
§ 137-6D hereof, the applicant shall prepare a mitigation plan.
(1) All mitigation measures shall balance the benefits of regaining new
wetlands areas with the loss to other natural areas caused by
wetlands creation. On-site mitigation shall be the preferred
approach; off-site mitigation shall be permitted only in cases where
an on-site alternative is not possible.
(2) Mitigation plans developed to compensate for the loss of wetlands
or wetlands buffers shall include baseline data as needed to
adequately review the effectiveness of this plan. The mitigation
plan shall also include a monitoring schedule for a specified period
of time as agreed to by the approving authority. [Amended
10-9-2001 by L.L. No. 5-2001]

the project site during the undertaking of the activities authorized
by the permit.
I. The approving authority shall include in the permit application file it
keeps a copy of any mitigation plan prepared pursuant to § 137-6F
hereof and a record of any hearing held pursuant to § 137-5J hereof.
J. The Planning Board, as the approving authority, may require prior to
the commencement of work authorized under any permit issued
pursuant to this chapter that the applicant shall post a bond or other
security acceptable to the Town Board in an amount and with surety
and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with the conditions and
limitations set forth in the permit. The particular amount and the
conditions of the bond shall be consistent with the purposes of this
chapter. The bond shall remain in effect until the issuance of a
certificate of completion as described in § 137-10 hereof and until the
bond is released by the approving authority or a substitute bond is
provided. In the event that any condition of any such bond is breached,
the Planning Board, as the approving authority, may recommend that
the Town institute an action in the courts upon such bond and prosecute
the same to judgment and execution.
K. No permit granted pursuant to this chapter shall remove an applicant's
obligation to comply in all respects with the applicable provisions of any
other federal, state or local law or regulation, including but not limited
to the securing of any other required permit or approval.
L. The approving authority may suspend or revoke a permit in the form of
a stop-work order if it finds that the applicant has not complied with any
or all of the terms of such permit, has exceeded the authority granted in
