EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

rule-making authority of Council.  These rules are in addition to any other
requirements imposed by law pertaining to the notification of meetings to be
given to the members of any Public Body, the public, or the news media. 
However, these rules shall not apply to an executive session held at a regular
or special meeting of any Public Body which is conducted for the purpose of
considering any of the matters set forth in Ohio R.C. 121.22(G), nor shall
these rules apply to any other meeting, conference, or discussion specifically
exempted by law from the requirements imposed by Ohio R.C. 121.22(F).

has made a diligent effort to communicate notification during the Fiscal
Officer regular business hours.
 
   (g)   In the event of an emergency requiring immediate official action, the
member or members of the Public Body calling the meeting shall notify (or make
a diligent effort to notify) the news media organizations who have filed a
request for notification with the Fiscal Officer of the time, place, and
purpose of the meeting.  Any such member or members may, in attempting to
notify the news media, rely upon the information filed with the Fiscal Officer
by any news media organization.
 
   (h)   Any person may upon request and payment in advance obtain reasonable
advance notification of all meetings at which any specific type of public
business is to be discussed.  Notification to any such person may include but

person's name, and the address(es) and telephone number(s) (not more than two)
at or through which the person can be reached during the Fiscal Officer’s
regular business hours; the specific type of public business the discussion of
which the person is requesting advance notification; the Public Body that is
the subject of such request; and the number of calendar months (not to exceed
six) which the request covers.  Such request may be canceled by written request
from such person to the Fiscal Officer.  The Fiscal Officer shall collect in
advance the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00), which sum is fixed by Council
as a reasonable fee for advance notification for any six months period and
which is non-refundable.  Notification may be provided by telephone or in
writing, at the option of the Fiscal Officer; except, however, that the Fiscal
Officer must make or attempt to make notification by telephone if notice is to
be provided within forty-eight hours of the meeting.

   (k)   The Fiscal Officer shall establish and maintain a complete record of
all action taken pursuant to these rules.

143.01  BENEFITS MANUAL.
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  The Village has adopted a Benefits Manual for Village
Employees.  Copies are on file with the Fiscal Officer.
143.02  ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS POLICY.
   (a)   The Village of Enon owns electronic and wire communication systems,
including but not limited to:
      (1)   Electronic mail (“e-mail”), including attachments;
      (2)   Voice mail; and
      (3)   Internet and Intranet use.
 
   (b)   Because these systems are owned by the Village of Enon, and are to be
used for business reasons, the contents of any communications transmitted
through or stored within these systems are Village property and are subject to
review by and disclosure to the Village of Enon.  Furthermore, in some
situations (e.g., litigation involving the Village of Enon), these
communications may be subject to disclosure to a third party.
 
   (c)   In order to assure that the systems are being used properly and in
compliance with this policy, the Village of Enon, without notice, may
periodically access, display, copy, delete or listen to any messages or
communications sent, received, created, deleted or stored through or in its
systems.
   (d)   Occasional personal use of the systems is permissible.  Occasional
personal use means minimal and infrequent use that does not interfere with
Village of Enon business or job performance.  Any employee communicating
personal messages should do so with the understanding that his or her messages
or communications are subject to being heard or read by the Village of Enon. 
You should not expect that any of these messages or communications will be
confidential or private. Village of Enon technology resources may not be used
for personal, commercial or profit-generating activities unrelated to Village
of Enon’s business.
   (e)   The Village of Enon may monitor Internet use, including reviewing the
list of sites accessed by any individual computer.  Your Internet use is not
private.  No employee should have any expectation of privacy regarding Internet
usage.  The Village of Enon reserves the right to inspect any computer anytime
or to use monitoring software in order to monitor Internet and computer use.
   (f)   These systems may not be used to access or transmit material, which
could embarrass, harass, or offend other persons.  Additionally, the Village of
Enon strictly prohibits the use of its systems to communicate sexually
offensive material or comments or anything that might offend or disparage
another person because of his or her race, color, religion, age, gender,
national origin, disability or veteran’s status. 
   (g)   Consistent with existing policies, employees are not to use the system
for solicitation of any kind, including the distribution of chain letters. 
   (h)   To maintain system security employees have the responsibility to
safeguard passwords and codes.  All passwords and codes are the property of the
Village of Enon.  Employees may be asked to release passwords or codes to
management on a need-to-know basis.  Employees must also take adequate measures
to ensure that their account on the Internet is not used by any other
individual including other members of their household.
   (i)   No employee shall use the passwords or codes of another employee in
order to gain access to that employee’s e-mail, voice mail, files, or Internet
communications unless first authorized to do so by that employee.  All
passwords and codes used in connection with these systems are the property of
the Village of Enon.  No employee shall use a password or code that is not
readily available to the Village of Enon at all times.  All passwords and codes
must be surrendered upon termination of employment for whatever reason.
   (j)   Only software authorized by the Village of Enon for its use may be
installed on Village of Enon computers.  The Village of Enon may, at any time,
conduct an audit of computers for installed software and related printed
material that is not included on a then-current inventory of Village of Enon
authorized software.  All unauthorized software will be removed.  In addition,
employees may not post, download or otherwise misuse any copyright protected
material without the prior permission of the copyright owner.
   (k)   For security reasons, employees accessing the Internet for business
use must only do so through the Village of Enon authorized connection and must
not utilize any other connection paths to the Internet.
(Ord. 2005-06. Passed 2-22-05.)
TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171.  Mayor’s Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor’s Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).  Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months.  "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases. 
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above.  Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973):  "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C).  If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality.  Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C):  "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any.  Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case.  Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic  violation bureau
and specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule
of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

   (a)   (1)   The Chief of Police upon complaint of any person adversely
affected may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk
motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, that has been left on private
residential or private agricultural property for at least four hours without
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property.  The Chief of Police, upon complaint of a repair garage or place of
storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk
motor vehicle, that has been left at the garage or place of storage for a
longer period than that agreed upon. When ordering a motor vehicle into storage

the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under subsection (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that
subsection.  The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location
designated by the Chief of Police not more than two hours after the time it is
removed from the private property, unless the towing service is unable to
deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force,
natural disaster, or other event that is not within the power of the towing
service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the

private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures.  "Private
residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section arrives after the motor
vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the
property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  However,
if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give  the owner
or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  That
fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a

the transaction. 
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator.  Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of motor vehicles

telephone number of the person from whom it may be recovered, and the address
of the place to which it has been taken and from which it may be recovered. 
The Chief of Police shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular motor vehicle to any person who, either in person or pursuant
to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor
vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under
subsection (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law
enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person who
identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests
information pertaining to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both
of the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 or, if the

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a

the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the vehicle, the
towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle shall give the
owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio R.C.
4513.611.
      (2)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in
rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items
after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the
notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if applicable.  The
owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.60)
303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.  If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.

the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall

operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by

municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the  transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a

313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

313.05  SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.

offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided

and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy- five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. 
The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten- day mandatory jail term
under this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years.  The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13.  (ORC 4511.19)

the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a

in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider
whether the evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.
   (g)   Points shall be assessed for violation of a limitation under
subsection (d) hereof in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
   (h)   Whenever, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or this section, the
speed limitations as established herein have been altered, either higher or
lower, and the appropriate signs giving notice have been erected as required,
operators of motor vehicles shall be governed by the speed limitations set
forth on such signs.  It is prima-facie unlawful for any person to exceed the

335.01  DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE  REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.

have more than one valid license at any time. 
(ORC 4507.02)
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever

necessary to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat or an occupant restraining device as
required by this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the
motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
   (h)   This section does not apply when an emergency exists that threatens
the life of any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle that is being

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the

the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster

at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).
      (2)   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty
to a violation of subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section or of a state

evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

353.01  DEFINITIONS.
   The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them:
   (a)   "Parking meter" means a mechanical device installed for the regulation
of parking by lawful authority.  Each parking meter shall contain a slot for
the deposit of lawful coin of the United States and a receptacle for receiving
and storing such coin.  Each parking meter shall display brief directions as to
its operation and the value of lawful coin required to be deposited.  Each
parking meter shall contain a timing mechanism which shall indicate either a
balance of legal parking time or overtime parking by an appropriate signal at
the expiration of such lawful time.
   (b)   "Parking meter space" means a space within a parking meter area, which
is designated for the parking of a single vehicle by marked lines on the curb
or paved surface area adjacent to a parking meter.  Posted notice on the meter
or on signs shall indicate the maximum consecutive parking time limit during
which a vehicle may be legally parked in a particular parking meter space and
the days and hours when the requirement to deposit lawful coin shall apply.
353.02  PARKING WITHIN MARKED LINES OF METER SPACE.
   No person shall park a vehicle in a parking meter space in such a way that
the vehicle shall not be entirely within the limits of the space so designated
by marked lines.
353.03  DEPOSIT OF COIN REQUIRED; ILLEGAL PARKING.
   No person shall cause, allow or permit a vehicle to occupy a parking meter
space during the hours when the provisions applicable to such space are in
effect, unless he shall deposit such lawful coin of the United States of
appropriate denomination in the adjacent parking meter, as required by
directions on the meter.  Such person is not required to deposit coin in a
meter which indicates a balance of unused legal parking time left by the
previous occupant of the space, so long as his occupancy of the space does not
exceed the indicated unused parking time.  The parking meter space may be
lawfully occupied by such vehicle during the balance of legal parking time
shown on the meter provided such occupancy does not exceed the established
maximum time limit.
   No person shall fail to comply with directions displayed on the parking
meter or fail to set the timing mechanism in operation when so required.
   No person shall cause, allow or permit a vehicle to occupy a meter space
beyond the maximum consecutive parking time limit lawfully prescribed, for the
particular space occupied, by appropriate notice on the meter or on posted
signs, irrespective of the number or amount of coin deposited in such meter.
353.04  PARKING PROHIBITED IN METER SPACE.
   Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, no person shall park in a
parking meter space when otherwise directed by a police officer or fireman or

the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08 .
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice does not become  inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
501.13  REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS OF CONFINEMENT.
   (a)   The Village does hereby require any person who is convicted of an
offense  other than a minor misdemeanor and is sentenced to confinement in the
County Jail to reimburse the Village for its expenses incurred by reason of the
offender’s confinement, including, but not limited to the expenses relating to
the provision of food, clothing, and shelter.  Such reimbursement shall include
expenses for pre-conviction confinement when credit for such confinement, is
credited against the term of imprisonment.
   (b)   The amount of the reimbursement required by this ordinance shall be
determined by the court after a hearing held pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.15, or
any subsequent amendment thereto.  The amount of the reimbursement ordered by
the court shall not exceed the actual costs of the confinement for each day of
the confinement.  The Court shall consider all factors that affect the
offender’s financial ability to make reimbursement to the Village.  When the
Municipal Court or Mayor’s Court makes a reimbursement determination pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 2929.15, a judgment entry and order of reimbursement shall be
filed and entered that sets forth the total amount of reimbursement due to the
Village and the reimbursement schedules and methods.
   (c)   This section shall not apply to offenders that the court finds to be
indigent.
   (d)   Funds that are reimbursed to the Village pursuant to this section
shall be paid into the general fund of the Village.
   (e)   If an offender does not pay to the Village the reimbursement ordered
by the court pursuant to this ordinance, the Village Solicitor may collect that
claim or institute an appropriate civil action in the name of the Village in
the Clark County Common Pleas Court to recover from the convict the
reimbursement for the expenses of confinement as determined by the court.  If
an action is filed it shall be brought no later than one year after the person
is released from incarceration. If it is determined in the best interest of the
Village, the Village Solicitor is authorized to compromise and settle such
claim in an amount less than the total reimbursement due to the Village if an
offender does not comply with the reimbursement determination for expenses of
confinement made by the Court, then the convict is deemed to be acting in bad
faith, vexatiously, wantonly, and obdurately and in any civil action on behalf
of the Village to recover the reimbursement for the expense of his confinement
the Village Solicitor or his representative shall request an award of attorney
fees as part of the costs of the proceedings.  The award of such attorney fees
shall be paid into the general fund of the Village.  (Ord. 98-10.  Passed 5-26-
98.)
501.14  CONSPIRACY.

prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:

the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed

      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind

difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

545.02  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
 545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
 545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense.  If the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
 
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:

wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

921.01  ADOPTION OF BY-LAWS; AMENDMENT.
   The by-laws and regulations herein after named shall be considered a part of
the contract of every person, company or corporation that is supplied with
water by Enon Municipal Water Works Department and every such person, company
or corporation by taking water shall be considered to express his or their
consent to be governed thereby.  These by-laws and regulations may be altered,
amended or added to at any time.
921.02  INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE.
   The Enon Water Works Department shall not be liable for damage resulting

Department for improvements or repairs.  Whenever possible, and as time
permits, all customers affected will be notified prior to such shutdowns.  The
Department will not be liable for interruptions, shortage or insufficiency of
supply, or for any loss or damage occasioned thereby, if caused by accident,
act of God, fire, strikes, riots, war or any other cause.  The Department,
whenever it shall find it necessary or convenient for the purpose of making
repairs or improvements to its system, shall have the right to suspend
temporarily, delivery of water and it shall not be liable for any loss or
damage occasioned thereby.  Repairs or improvements will be prosecuted as
rapidly as is practicable and, so far as possible, at such time as will cause
the least inconvenience to the customer.

NOTE:  All Department employees carry small identification cards.
921.04  ACCESS TO METERS.
   Access, at reasonable hours, will be provided to Enon Water Works Department

termination of water service.  Service will not be restored until the customer
or owner of the premises pays for the estimated quantity of water which has
been used and not registered, and, in addition thereto, the standard fee for
turning on such water.  Payment of the fees herein will not in any way relieve
any person from criminal prosecution, as provided by Ohio R.C. 4933.99.  Meters

use without first having secured the necessary application from the
Department.  Penalty for violation of this subsection shall not be less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
or imprisonment for not more than thirty days, or both.  (A.O.)

registering device, or appliance in or attached to any well, tower, pipe, main,
service line or other apparatus of the Enon Water Works system without written
authorization from the Department.  No person shall tap, sever, open or make
unauthorized connections with a main or pipe used or intended for the
transmission of water.  In case of damage by any person, he shall upon demand
of the Enon Water Works Department pay such damages and all cost and expenses
incurred by reason thereof.  The penalty for violation of this subsection shall
not be less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than five hundred dollars

groundwires or wires to any plumbing which is or may be connected to a service
connection or main belonging to the Enon Water Works Department.  The
Department will hold the customer liable for any damage to its property or
injury to its personnel occasioned by such groundwire attachments.  The
presence of such groundwire attachments will be sufficient cause for immediate
discontinuance of service.
921.10  DEPOSIT; TENANTS.
   In the case where two or more tenants receive water from one meter, service
will be granted in the owner's name only.  Anyone who makes application for
water service other than a property owner shall make a deposit equivalent to
four months water rent.  Such deposit will be refunded upon payment of the
final water  bill.
921.11  TURN-ON: TURN-OFF REQUESTS.

will be notified on the fifteenth of the following month that his account is
delinquent.  If such delinquent bill and current bill are not paid in full
before the thirtieth of the month, the customer will be notified by letter that
water service to his property will be reviewed for discontinuance without
further notice.

unless and until, and only to the extent that he is ordered to do so by the
decision of Council or upon prior settlement of the dispute.
   (b)   If the termination of water service to any customer, due to inability

1101.01  AUTHORITY.
   The Planning Commission is authorized to adopt rules and regulations
governing plats and subdivisions of land falling within its jurisdiction, to
recommend the nature and the extent of improvements required to be installed in
a subdivision, and to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove subdivision
plats.
(Ord. 60-18.  Passed 6-23-60.)
1101.02  PURPOSE.
   In the enactment of these Subdivision Regulations the Commission seeks to
accomplish the following objectives which will promote the safety, morals,
welfare, and health of the present and future population of Enon, Ohio:
   (a)   To establish standards for logical, sound, and economical development
of Enon, Ohio;
   (b)   To coordinate streets and highways in a manner which may promote safe
and convenient circulation and which may eliminate traffic hazards;
   (c)   To prevent premature subdivision involving lack of water supply,
drainage, sewage facilities, and other public services which may impose
excessive expenditures of funds;
   (d)   To plan adequate provision for schools, recreation, business, and
industry.
      (Ord. 60-18.  Passed 6-23-60.)
1101.03  CONFLICT.
   The provisions of the Subdivision Regulations shall be held to be minimum
requirements and are not intended to interfere with any other existing
provisions of law.  Whenever these Regulations may impose greater restrictions,
the same shall control.
(Ord. 60-18.  Passed 6-23-60.)
1101.04  SCOPE.
   These Regulations shall be applicable to all subdivisions hereinafter made
of land located in the incorporated area of Enon, Ohio, or any subdivision
beyond the corporate limits which shall use the utilities owned by the Village
and which subdivision shall be expected to be annexed to the Village at some
future time, and to the preparation of subdivision maps to be submitted for
consideration of the Commission.  Each map shall be prepared and submitted
according to the foregoing provisions.
(Ord. 60-18.  Passed 6-23-60.)
1101.05  AMENDMENT.
   (a)    Council may, on its own motion and after public hearing, amend,
supplement, or change these Regulations.  Notice shall be given of the time and
place of such public hearing by posting as required by ordinance for fifteen
days prior to holding of the hearing.  The amendment or amendments shall be on
file in the office of the Fiscal Officer for public examination during such
fifteen days.
   (b)   The Commission may issue periodic recommendations for the
administration of these Regulations in order that the public may be kept
informed and so as to expedite approval of subdivisions more efficiently.
(Ord. 60-18.  Passed 6-23-60.)
1101.06  VARIATIONS.
   A variation from these Regulations may be authorized by the Commission when,
in its opinion, undue hardship may result from strict compliance.  The
Commission's final determination shall be based, fundamentally, in that the
granting of the variations will not adversely affect the general public and
will not nullify the intent of these Regulations.  Application for any such
exception shall be submitted in writing by the subdivider at the time when the
preliminary plan is submitted for consideration of the Commission.  The
petition shall state fully the grounds of the application and all the facts
relied upon by the petitioner.
(Ord. 60-18.  Passed 6-23-60.)
1101.07  ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Plat Void if Revised After Approval.  No changes, erasures,
modifications, or revision shall be made in any plat of a subdivision after
approval has been given by the Commission, and endorsed in writing on the plat,
unless the plat is first re-submitted to the Commission.  In the event that any
such plat is recorded without complying with the aforementioned requirement,
the same shall be considered invalid and the Commission shall institute
proceedings to have the plat stricken from the records of Clark County, Ohio.
   (b)   Approval of Installation of Improvements.  Periodic inspections during
the installation of improvements shall be made by the Village to insure
conformity with the approved plans and specifications.  The subdivider shall
notify the proper administrative officers, when each phase of the installation
is completed and ready for inspection.  Upon completion of installation of the
required improvements, the administrative officers charged with the
responsibility for each of the various types of improvements shall issue a
letter of approval to the developer or subdivider and such letter shall be
evidence for the release of a surety bond which shall have been furnished as a
guarantee of satisfactory installation.
   (c)   Proper Installation of Improvement.    If the administrative officers
charged with the responsibility of inspecting the various types of improvements
find, upon inspection, that any of the required improvements have not been
constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications filed in their
respective offices by the subdivider, the responsibility of the Village shall
cease.  The subdivider and the bonding company will be severally and jointly
liable for the costs of completion of such improvements according to
specifications.  No plat which may be an extension, part, or section of a
previously recorded plat, or no new plat, regardless of locations, shall be
approved by the Commission if the subdivider has not fully complied with the
construction of all the required improvements in a previously recorded plat
submitted by him for approval.  As a condition for the approval of such plat,
the Commission shall require that the conditions of the former agreement be met
by the subdivider before the Commission shall take action on the plat.
(Ord. 60-18.  Passed 6-23-60.)
1101.08  SEPARABILITY.
   If, for any reason, any clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or other part

Commission for acquisition by the School District in such locations within the
subdivision as shall be agreed upon by the Board of Education, the Developer,
and the Commission.  Purchase price shall be a part of this agreement and this
reservation shall be, in effect, an option granted to the Board of Education to
purchase within a two year period from date the subdivision is recorded. 
Failure on the part of the School District to exercise this option shall result
in offering such parcel to the Municipal government at the same agreed price
for sixty days and, if not accepted by the Village, the subdivider shall be

in a subdivision previously recorded in the office of the Recorder of Clark
County, Ohio, the same procedure, rules, and regulations shall apply as for a
new plat.  The title of the vacations shall indicate just what is being
vacated, and the final map shall include enough of the surrounding plat or
plats to show its relation to adjoining areas.
   (g)   Replat of Lots.  Whenever a subdivider or developer proposes a re-

1109.01  MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS.
   The minimum improvements which the subdivider will be required to make or
enter into agreement to make in a subdivision prior to the approval of the
final map by the Commission shall be as prescribed by the following
provisions.  All of these improvements shall be carried out in full compliance
with the specifications for each of the various units of work as required by
the Village Administrator/designee, County Sanitary Engineer, or County Board
of Health, according to the nature of the improvement.  Nothing in these
Regulations shall be construed to prohibit the subdivider from constructing
higher types of improvements than required by the Village.
(Ord. 60-18.  Passed 6-23-60.)
1109.02  STREETS.
   (a)   The subdivider shall improve all streets, or highways, which are a
part of the subdivision.  The required improvements shall be such as may be
necessary for the general use of the residents and shall include grading and
surfacing of streets and the drainage thereof.  All street improvements shall
be approved by the Village Administrator/designee prior to acceptance of the
streets or release of performance bond.
   (b)   In order that construction of dwellings may begin without undue
hardship to the developer and/or excessive damage to the streets, such streets
may be laid in two stages described in the following paragraphs.  The finished
street shall conform to the cross-sectional drawings for Collector and Standard
Streets shown in the appendix of these Subdivision Regulations and shall be
completed not less than two years after grading has started.
   (c)   Prior to construction of the base course, the subsurface shall be
brought to a uniform grade and cross section.  It shall be thoroughly compacted
and cleared of foreign matter.  Immediately following the preparation of the
sub-surface, course aggregate Ohio State Specification B219.03 and within the
limits specified in the composition table under Section B219.06 or fully equal
shall be spread on the prepared subgrade in such loose depth as will provide a
minimum of six inches of  compacted aggregate in the base course.  The
aggregate shall be spread by hand or from self-spreading devices.  Dumping "en
masse" on the subgrade shall not be permitted.  If aggregate segregates into
sizes in handling, it shall be remixed until it presents a uniform appearance
prior to spreading on the road.  The surface of the loose aggregate shall be
carefully shaped with a blade grader (except where hand shaping is approved by
the Village Administrator/designee), and all high and low spots remedied by
removing or adding aggregate as may be required.  It shall then be rolled once,
with a three-wheeled roller weighing not less than five tons and having a
minimum weight of 200 pounds per inch width of the rear wheel.  Rolling shall
start longitudinally at the sides and proceed toward the center of the
pavement, overlapping on successive trips by at least one half the width of a
rear wheel.
   (d)   Aggregate course number two shall be applied immediately prior to
final surfacing and shall be laid in the same manner as course number one so
that the total depth of course number one and course number two shall be not
less than eight inches.  During and after the laying of course number two, no
traffic shall be permitted on the improvement until the surface has been
finished.  The surface of the base shall be kept free of dirt and foreign
substances and shall in every way meet the approval of the Village
Administrator/designee before Bituminous Prime Coat is applied.
   (e)   Prime Coat shall be T-30 Specification applied eight-tenths (0.8) to
one and one-tenths (1.1) gallons per square yard and while yet warm, there
shall be spread over its surface a light sprinkling of clean, dry No. 5
aggregate in just sufficient quantity to prevent the roller wheels from
sticking.  The road surface shall be rolled until the stone is thoroughly
imbedded into the asphalt primer and anchored in place.  The aggregate for this
purpose shall be applied by means of a mechanical spreader and shall be ready
for immediate use before any asphalt primer shall be applied.  It shall be
applied ahead of truck or spreader wheels.  The rolling shall continue until
the pavement is firmly bound together, and the surface is hard and smooth and
shows no perceptible movement under the roller.
   (f)   The pavement shall then be treated with a second and third application
of Bituminous Material Specification T-31 in the same manner as specified in
the preceding paragraph except that the rate of application shall be from
three-tenths (0.3) to four-tenths (0.4) gallons per square yard and the
aggregate shall be mixture of No. 6 and No. 9.
   (g)   After completion of the seal coat, the surface of the finished
pavement shall be free from depressions exceeding one half inch as measured
with a ten foot straight edge paralleling the center of the roadway.
   (h)   The control of traffic during the period of construction shall be the
responsibility of the developer.
(Ord. 60-18.  Passed 6-23-60.)

   Where public water supply is within a reasonable distance, as determined by
the Commission, the subdivider or developer shall construct a system of water
mains, connect with such public water supply and provide a connection for each
lot.
(Ord. 60-18.  Passed 6-23-60.)
1109.06  SANITARY SEWERS.
   Sanitary sewers shall not be required.
(Ord. 60-18.  Passed 6-23-60.)
1109.07  STORM SEWERS.
   Adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm water subject to
the requirements of the Village Administrator/designee and the approval of the
Commission.
(Ord. 60-18.  Passed 6-23-60.)
1109.08  SURVEY MONUMENTS.
   (a)   A complete survey shall be made by a registered engineer or surveyor.
   (b)   The traverse of the exterior boundaries of the tract and of each
block, when computed from field measurements of the ground, shall close within
a limit of error of 1-foot to 10,000 of the perimeter before balancing the
survey.
   (c)   Permanent reference monuments made of stone or concrete, at least
thirty-six inches in length and six inches square with suitable center point,
shall be located and placed within the subdivision.  These monuments shall be
placed as soon after the grading of streets is completed and the cost of the
monuments will be included in the cost of improving the streets.
   (d)   Iron Pin or Pipe monuments three-fourths inch in diameter and thirty
inches long shall be placed by the surveyor or engineer at all points on
boundary lines where there is a change of direction and at all lot corners.
(Ord. 60-18.  Passed 6-23-60.)
1109.09  PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (a)   No subdivision shall be approved until Council is satisfied that all
improvements required by this section have been constructed.  In lieu of the
completion of the improvements, a bond executed by a surety company shall be
furnished by the subdivider equal to the cost of construction of such
improvements as shown by the plans based on an estimate furnished by the
Village Administrator/designee.  The surety will be subject to the condition
that the improvements will be completed within twelve months after approval,
and in the event they are not completed, the Village shall proceed with the
work and hold the owner and the bonding company jointly responsible for the
costs thereof.
   (b)   The bond shall be subject to the approval of Council.

1155.04   Standards for Planned Development.
1155.05   Procedure.
 
 
1155.01  INTENT.
   Planned Development Districts are hereby established and may be permitted as
amendments to the Zoning Map but in both cases require application and approval
of specific and detailed plans, where tracts suitable in location and character
for the uses and structures proposed are to be planned and developed as units. 
Regulations set forth herein are adapted to unified planning and development in
such districts.  Applications for Planned Development (either by a rezoning
amendment or when such tract is within a Planned Development District) will be
granted only when the Development Plan for the project is such that the public
health, safety, and morals will not be jeopardized by a departure from the
restrictions on corresponding uses in the standard zoning district.
(Ord. 74-8.  Passed 10-3-74.)
1155.02  APPLICATION.
   The provisions of this Chapter may apply to any land within the Village of
Enon that are regulated by Enon Planning and Zoning Code, which is to be
developed in a more flexible manner than permitted by the provisions of Chapter
1131 through
1154 of these Regulations.  All requirements of the Enon Subdivision
Regulations shall be complied with.
1155.03  TYPES OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENT.
   "PD-R" Planned Development - Residential District
   "PD-O" Planned Development - Office District

   (Ord. 74-8.  Passed 10-3-74.)
1155.04  STANDARDS FOR PLANNED DEVELOPMENT.
   Council shall not approve an application for Planned Development unless it
shall, in each specific case, make specific findings of fact directly based
upon the particular evidence presented to it, which support conclusions that:
   (a)   The Planned Development can be substantially completed within the
period of time specified in the schedule of development submitted by the
developer.  The Planned Development will not jeopardize the public health,
safety, and morals.
   (b)   The site will be accessible from public roads that are adequate to
carry the traffic that will be imposed upon them by the proposed Development
and the streets and driveways on the site of the proposed Development will be
adequate to serve the residents or occupants of the proposed Development. 
Traffic control signals will be provided without expense when the Village
Administrator/County Engineer determines that such signals are required to
prevent traffic hazards or congestion in adjacent streets.  If warranted or
recommended by the Administrator/County Engineer, the developer will be
required to submit a traffic study to determine whether offsite improvements or
devices are needed to maintain a suitable level of service on the adjacent
public roadways.
   (c)   The Development will not impose an undue burden on public services and
facilities, such as fire and police protection.
   (d)   The Development Plan contains such proposed covenants, easements, and
other provisions relating to the proposed development standards as reasonably
are required for the public health safety and morals.
   (e)   Utilities and public facilities for the proposed development shall be
installed at the expense of the developer.
   (f)   The location and arrangement of structures, parking areas, walks,
lighting, and appurtenant facilities shall be compatible with the surrounding
land uses, and any part of the planned development not used for structures,
parking, and loading areas, or access ways shall be landscaped, improved, or
otherwise used appropriately in concert with the overall development.
   (g)   When business or manufacturing structures or uses in a Planned
Development District abut a Residential District, screening shall be provided
as provided in Chapters
1156 to
1159.  In no event shall a business or manufacturing structure in a Planned
Development District be located nearer than 100 feet to a residential building.

Notes:
   (a)   In those instances where a public sanitary sewer system is neither
accessible nor installed, all lots per dwelling unit shall be a minimum of
20,000 square feet in lot area with a lot frontage at the building line of 150
feet.  However, where a public sanitary sewer system is accessible and will be
installed, but a public water supply system is lacking, these requirements
shall be 16,000 square feet and 100 feet, respectively.
   (b)   Except signs and billboards whose heights are controlled by the
appropriate Sections of Chapter
1171 .
   (c)   For single family dwellings the height, bulk, density, and area
requirements of District "R-4" shall apply.
   (d)   For single and two family dwellings the height, bulk, density, and
area requirements of District "R-4" and "R-5" shall apply.
   (e)   None required unless adjoining a residential district, and then not
less than fifteen feet on each side, or one-fourth the sum of the height and
depth of the structure, whichever is greater.
   (f)   None required unless adjoining a residential district.  Such yard
shall be equal to twice the height of the structure, with a minimum requirement
of twenty feet and a maximum requirement of forty feet on each side.
   (g)   A rear yard shall be required adjacent to a Residential Zoning
District or Planned Residential District.  Such yard shall be not less than
one-fourth the sum of the height and width of the structure, but in no case
shall be less than twenty feet.  If a use is to be serviced from the rear, a
yard shall be provided not less than forty feet deep.
   (h)   A rear yard shall be required adjacent to a Residential or a Planned
Residential District.  Such rear yard shall be equal to twice the height of the
structure with a minimum requirement of twenty feet and a maximum requirement
of fifty feet.  If a use is to be serviced from the rear, the yard shall be at
least fifty feet deep. (Ord. 74-8.  Passed 10-3-74.)
1161.02  SUBDIVISION OPEN SPACE PLAN.
   (a)   Intent.  The intent of the Subdivision Open Space Plan is to promote
the following objectives:
      (1)   Provide a more desirable living environment by preserving the
natural character of open fields, stands of trees, brooks, hills, and similar
natural assets.
      (2)   Encourage developer to use a more creative approach in the
development of residential areas.
      (3)   Encourage a more efficient, aesthetic, and desirable use of open
space while recognizing a reduction in development costs and by allowing the
developer to bypass natural obstacles on the site.
      (4)   Encourage the provision of open space within reasonable distance to
all lot development of the subdivision and to encourage further the development
of recreational facilities.
   (b)   Procedure.  Modifications to the standards as outlined in Section
1161.01  may be made in the Single Family Residential Districts when the
following conditions are met:
      (1)   The lot area in all Single Family Residential Districts which are
served by a public sanitary sewer and water system may be reduced up to twenty
percent (20%).  In the "R-4" District, this reduction may be accomplished in
part by reducing lot widths up to five feet.  In the "R-1," "R-2," and "R-3"
Districts, the lot width reduction may be up to ten feet.  These lot area
reductions shall be permitted provided that the dwelling unit density shall be
no greater than if the land area to be subdivided were developed in the minimum
square foot lot areas as required under Section
1161.01 .  All calculations shall be predicated upon the Single Family
Districts having the following gross densities (including roads):
         "R-1" = 1.5 Dwelling units per acre
         "R-2" = 2.2 Dwelling units per acre
         "R-3" = 2.9 Dwelling units per acre
         "R-4" = 3.6 Dwelling units per acre
      (2)   Rear yards may be reduced to thirty feet when such lots border on
land dedicated for park, recreation, and/or open space purposes provided that
the width of such dedicated land shall not be less than ninety feet measured at
the point at which it abuts the rear yard of the adjacent lot.
      (3)   Dedicated land shall not include bodies of water, swamps, or land
with excessive grades making it unsuitable for recreation.  All dedicated land
shall be so graded and developed as to have natural drainage.  The entire area
may, however, be located in a flood plain.
      (4)   The developer or subdivider shall dedicate the total park area at
the time of filing the final plat.  In no instance shall dedication be less
than five acres.
         (Ord. 74-8.  Passed 10-3-74.)
1161.03  SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   Ten copies of a site plan shall be submitted to Planning Commission
for approval of:
      (1)   Any use or development for which the submission of a site plan is
required by any provision of the Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Any development, except single family residential, for which off
street parking areas are provided as required by Chapter
1175.
      (3)   Any use which lies contiguous to a thoroughfare.
      (4)   All residentially related uses permitted in single family
residential districts such as, but not limited to, churches, schools, and
public facilities.
   
   (b)   Site plans shall be reviewed in two stages:  preliminary and final
plans.  Preliminary plans shall be approved either prior to a rezoning request
or issuance of a zoning certificate.  The preliminary plan shall show
development of the entire parcel.  Modifications and refinements to the
preliminary plan shall be shown in a final development plan.  Final site plans
may be approved in the developments' entirety or in stages.
   (c)   Each site plan submitted to the Planning Commission in accordance with
the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance shall contain such information and be
in such form as the Planning Commission may prescribe in its rules.
   In all cases, however, the site plan shall show the following:
      (1)   Established building lines drawn in conformance to applicable
district requirements.
      (2)   Parking and loading spaces in accordance with Chapters
1173 and
1175.
      (3)   The location, effect, arrangement, and size of all outdoor signs
and lighting fixtures in conformity to Chapter
1171.
      (4)   Landscape and screening plan for screening nonresidential uses and
parking areas from adjoining residential property and single family residential
from multiple family residential districts.
      (5)   Architectural plans of the buildings and structures proposed to be
constructed.
   (d)   In the process of reviewing the site plan, the Planning Commission
shall consider:
      (1)   Residential and nonresidential developments designed in accordance
with the Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   The traffic circulation features within the site and location of
automobile parking areas; and may make such requirements with respect to any
matters as will assure:
         A.   Safety and convenience of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic
both within the site and in relation to access streets;
         B.   Satisfactory and harmonious relations between the development of
the site and the existing and prospective development of contiguous land and
adjacent neighborhoods.
      (3)   The Planning Commission may further require landscaping, fences,
and walls in pursuance of these objectives and the same shall be provided and
maintained as a condition of the establishment and the continued maintenance of
any use to which they are appurtenant.
      (4)   The location and design of driveways providing vehicular ingress to
and egress from the site, in relation to streets giving access to the site, and
in relation to pedestrian traffic.
      (5)   Any other authority approval required such as State Department of
Health, State Highway Department, or Clark County Health Department shall
accompany the site plan conditionally for a six month period pending review
from other authorities, after which time the zoning certificate may be revoked.

Nonconforming Uses
1163.01   Conformance required
1163.02   Nonconforming vacant lots.
1163.03   Nonconforming structures.
1163.04   Nonconforming uses.
 
 
1163.01  CONFORMANCE REQUIRED.
   Except as hereinafter specified, no land, building, structure, or premises
shall hereafter be used, and no building or part thereof, or other structure,
shall be located, erected, moved, reconstructed, extended, enlarged, or altered
except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in
which it is located.
(Ord. 74-8.  Passed 10-3-74.)
1163.02  NONCONFORMING VACANT LOTS.
   (a)   Single Nonconforming Vacant Lots in Residential Districts.   In any
district where dwellings are permitted, a one family detached dwelling may be
erected on any lot of official record as of the effective date of the Zoning
Ordinance, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance.  Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous
frontage with other lots in the same ownership.  This provision shall apply
when by reason of its lot area, width, or depth it does not meet minimum
requirements  for a lot under these regulations, provided, however, that no lot
shall be deemed to be less than forty feet wide for the calculation  of yard
requirements and provided, further:
      (1)   The sum of the side yard widths on any such lot of record shall be
at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the width of the lot.
      (2)   In no case shall the width of any side yard be less than ten
percent (10%) of the width of the lot, except that on a corner lot, the width
of side yard adjoining the side street lot line shall not be less than ten
feet.
      (3)   The depth of the rear yard of any such lot need not exceed twenty
percent (20%) of the depth of the lot, but in no case shall it be less than
twenty feet.
      (4)   If the width of such lot meets the standards  of the Zoning
Ordinance but the depth is such that the total area is less than 10,000 square
feet, the rear yard for such lot shall have a minimum of thirty percent (30%)
of the depth of the lot but in no case shall it be less than thirty feet.
   (b)   Nonconforming Lot of Record in Combination.  If two or more lots or
combinations of lots and portion of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of the Zoning
Ordinance and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot
width and area, the land involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel
for the purpose of the Zoning Ordinance and no portion of such parcel shall be
used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area
requirements established by the Zoning Ordinance, nor shall any division of any
parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements
stated in the Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   Nonconforming Vacant Lots in Other Districts.  In any district, other
than a Residential District, a building designed for any permitted use in such
district may be erected on any lot of official record as of the effective date
of this Zoning Ordinance provided that:
Such building shall comply with all regulations applicable in the district in
which the lot in question is located, provided, however, the width of any
required side yard need not be greater than that derived by applying the
following equation, where "X" = the required side yard width:
 
               Minimum side yard required
                         X             =   by district regulations 
   actual lot width      minimum lot width required
               by district regulations
   (Ord. 74-8.  Passed 10-3-74.)
1163.03  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Continuation.  Any structure which is devoted to a use which is
permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, but which is located
on a lot which does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements and/or
development standards, may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the restrictions of subsections (b) to (d).
   (b)   Enlargement, Repair, Alterations.  Any such structure described in
subsection (a) hereof may be enlarged, maintained, repaired, or structurally
altered, provided, however, that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair, or
structural alteration shall either create any additional nonconformity of all
or any part of such structures, except that as to structures located on a lot
that does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements, the side yard
requirements shall be determined by subsection (b) or (c), whichever is
applicable.
   (c)   Damage or Destruction.  In the event that any such structure described
in subsection (a) is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more
than fifty percent (50%) of the current replacement cost of the entire
structure, such structure shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located,
provided that structures located on a lot that does not comply with the
applicable lot size requirements shall not in any event be required to provide
a side yard that exceeds the yard requirements in subsection (b) or (c),
whichever is applicable.  When a structure is damaged to the extent of fifty
percent (50%) or less, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a zoning
certificate is obtained and restoration is actually begun within one year after
the date of such partial destruction.
   (d)   Moving.  No structure described in subsection (a) shall be moved in
whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same
or any other lot, unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the zoning district in which it will be located after being
moved.
(Ord. 74-8.  Passed 10-3-74.)
1163.04  NONCONFORMING USES.

   (b)   Repair and Maintenance.
      (1)   Work may be done on ordinary maintenance and repairs, or on repair
or replacement of walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided, however, that
this subsection (b)(1) shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of
subsection (c) to (i).
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of a building or other structure
(other than a damaged or destroyed building or other structure subject to the
provisions of subsection (e) hereof) in accordance with the order of a public
official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such
building or other structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe
condition.
      (3)   Nonconforming residential buildings in a Business or Industrial
District may be maintained, repaired, improved, modernized or enlarged,
provided, however, that no increase in the number of dwelling units shall be
permitted.

the entire building or other structure and the use thereof shall thereafter
conform to the regulations of the district in which such structure is located
except as provided in subsection (d), (e), and (g).
   (d)   Extension and Enlargement.  The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit a
nonconforming building or structure to be extended, expanded, enlarged, or

building or structure, or a substitution of a nonconforming use in such a
building or structure, but not both.
      (3)   A nonconforming building or structure may be extended or enlarged
upon the lot occupied by such building on the effective date of the Zoning
Ordinance or on an adjoining lot, provided such lot was under the same
ownership as the lot in question on the effective date of the Zoning
Ordinance.  Such nonconforming building may be enlarged or extended to an
extent not exceeding twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross floor area of such
nonconforming structure or building lawfully existing at the time of the
adoption of the Zoning Ordinance.
      (4)   The extension or enlargement of a nonconforming building or
structure may not occupy ground space suitable and otherwise available for
meeting the off street parking requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
      (5)   A nonconforming use of land may not be extended, enlarged, or
increased in intensity.
      (6)   Nothing contained in this section shall in any way prohibit a
nonconforming use from acquiring additional off street parking space.
      (7)   Application for an extension or enlargement in accordance with
paragraphs A through F shall be noticed and heard in the manner prescribed for
appeals in Section
1183.04 .
   (e)   Damage or Destruction.  In the event that any building or structure
that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is damaged or
destroyed, by any means, to such an extent that the cost of restoration to the
condition in which it was before such damage or destruction exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the current replacement cost of the entire building or other
structure, exclusive of foundation, such building or other structure shall not
be restored unless such building or other structure and the use thereof shall
thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
Moreover, even if such damage is fifty percent (50%) or less, no repair or
restoration shall be made unless a building permit is obtained, and restoration
is actually begun, within one year after the date of such partial destruction.
   (f)   Moving.  No structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming
use shall be moved to any other location on the same lot or any other lot
unless the entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the district in which it will be located after being so moved. 
Moreover, no nonconforming land use shall be relocated, in whole or in part, to
any other location on the same or any other lot unless such use shall
thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located
after being moved.
   (g)   Change.  The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit a substitution for a
nonconforming use in a building or structure lawfully existing at the time of

the regulations of the district in which it is located.
      (2)   Discontinuance of nonconforming use of buildings or structures.  In
the event that operation of a nonconforming use of all or part of a building or
other structure is voluntarily discontinued for a period of two years, such

driveway of a single family residence may be counted as one parking space.
   (d)   Required Yards.  Structures and buildings containing off street
parking shall be subject to the yard requirements applicable in the district in
which located.  Off street parking areas open to the sky may be located on any
yard, except that:
      (1)   In any "R" District, off street parking shall not be located in any
required set backs.
      (2)   In any "R" or "B-1" District on a corner lot devoted to a
residential use, the off street parking shall not be located closer to the side
lot line bounding a street than the minimum side yard width prescribed by the
development standards for the district.
      (3)   If a lot is devoted to a nonresidential use and if its front lot
line, side lot line, or rear lot line separates the lot from a lot in a
Residential District, the off street parking facilities located thereon shall
not be closer to such lot line than the minimum front yard depth, side yard
width, or rear yard depth prescribed by the development standard for the
district.
   (e)   Location.  All required parking spaces shall be located as follows:
      (1)   In any "R" or "B-1" District on the same lot as the building or use
served, or a contiguous parcel, or within 300 feet of the nearest point of the
principal structure.
      (2)   In a Business District (except a "B-1" District) on the same lot as

counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the off street parking
requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Fixed Seats and Assembly Area.  In cases where a place of assembly
has both fixed seats and open assembly area, requirements shall be computed
separately for each type and added together.
   (d)   Fractions.  When units of measurement determining the number of
required parking spaces result in requirement of a fractional space, any
fraction up to one-half shall be disregarded and fractions of over and
including one-half shall require one parking space.

in an increase in the number of units used to measure required off street
parking spaces, and such addition or extension creates a need for an increase
of more than ten percent (10%) in the number of required off street parking
spaces, additional off street parking shall be provided on the basis of the
increases in the number of such units of measurement.
   (b)   In the case of additional dwelling units created by conversion of an
existing dwelling, one off street parking space shall be required for each
additional dwelling unit so created.
(Ord. 74-8.  Passed 10-3-74.)
1175.07  MIXED OCCUPANCIES AND USES NOT SPECIFIED.
   In the case of mixed uses, the total requirements for off street parking
facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed
separately.  Where a use is not specifically mentioned in Section
1175.02, the requirements for a use in similar shall apply.  Off street parking
facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing requirements for
any other use, except as specified for joint use.
(Ord. 74-8.  Passed 10-3-74.)
1175.08  COLLECTIVE PROVISION.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent collective provision
of off street parking facilities for two or more buildings or uses, provided
that the total of such off street parking spaces supplied collectively shall be
not less than the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed
separately and also provided that the requirements set forth in Section
1175.03(e) as to maximum distances between parking areas and establishments
served shall apply to each establishment participating in the collective
provisions of parking.
(Ord. 74-8.  Passed 10-3-74.)
1175.09  JOINT USE.
   Section
1175.08 notwithstanding, up to fifty percent (50%) of the required off street
parking requirement for theaters, bowling alleys, restaurants, bars, and
similar uses may be waived when such use is contiguous or within 300 feet of a
school, church, auditorium, or similar use which is closed during the principal
operating hours that the aforesaid uses are open.  Further, provided that a
properly drawn legal instrument is executed by the parties concerned for the
joint use of the off street parking facilities, which instrument shall be
approved by the municipal attorney and filed with the application for a zoning
certificate.

control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the Village of Enon, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The Village of Enon has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible;
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Enon as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas of
special flood hazard annexed by the Village of Enon.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Clark County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Clark County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective February 17, 2010.
         (Ord. 09-12.  Passed 12-8-09.)
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Enon as required by Section
1311.04 (c).
      (3)   Other Studies and / or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood  protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (4)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations.
Such maps and/or studies are on file at the Village of Enon Government Center,
363 East Main Street, Enon, Ohio 45323.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Enon, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.  (Ord. 07-
10.  Passed 12-11-07.)
1311.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal:  A request for review of the floodplain administrator’s

the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).

   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA);  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   FloodorFlooding:  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM):  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones:  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100- year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus one (1) foot of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway: 
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure:  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the Village of Enon or the Enon Community Historical Society’s historic
preservation program, which is certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation
Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis:  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC):  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR):  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home:  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Enon Flood
Insurance Rate Map, dated April 17, 1987, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
“Agency” does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general’s department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle:  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect:  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer:  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor:  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure:  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement:  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance:  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.  (Ord. 07-10.  Passed 12-11-07.)

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the Village of Enon flood maps, studies and other data identified
in subsection (f) hereof accurately represent flooding conditions so
appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current data, the
following map maintenance activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;

culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1311.04 (c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1311.03 (j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.

Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1311.03 (j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Administrator of
the Village of Enon, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Enon have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Enon’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Village of
Enon boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
Village of Enon suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the Village of Enon has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1311.05  Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1311.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or

watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village of Enon specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1311.03 (j)(1)A.3., when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
            (Ord. 07-10.  Passed 12-11-07.)
1311.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Council of the Village of Enon shall appoint an Appeals Board
consisting of the same five (5) regular members and same alternate member as
the Board of Zoning Appeals and serve as provided by Section

replaced by the Council of the Village of Enon with each member serving until
his/her successor is appointed.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
the Administrative Offices of the Village of  Enon located at the Government
Center, 363 East Main Street, Enon, Ohio 45323.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1311.05 (d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals.  Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator’s decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made
to the Appeals Board. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties
in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is
submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee as listed in Section
1181.07  of the Village’s Zoning Code.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing not less than 15 days nor more than 70 days after the
receipt of an application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator.
Prior to the hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or
more newspapers of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days
before the date of the hearing.  In addition, written notice to property owners
within 300 feet of the applicant’s property shall be given at least ten (10)
days prior to the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1311.05 (d)(3)A.1. to 11., have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision
using the “Standards for Variances” Section
1183.06 (e) of the Village’s Zoning Ordinance.  The decision may be announced
at the conclusion of the hearing and thereafter issued in writing or the
decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable time after the hearing
but in all cases within 30 days after the close of the hearing.
   (f)   Appeals to Council or Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the
Appeals Board may appeal such decision to the Enon Village Council using the
procedures as stated in Sections
1185.06  (a) and (b) of the Village’s Zoning Ordinance or by appealing to the
Clark Court of Common Pleas, as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised
Code.

1331.05  VALIDITY.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this

and date.
(Ord. 04-06.  Passed 3-9-04.)

   If any owner, occupant or other person in charge of a structure subject to
the provisions of this code refuses, impedes, inhibits, interferes with,
restricts, or obstructs entry and free access to any part of the structure or
premises where inspection is authorized by this code, the Village Administrator
or designee may seek a court order that such owner, occupant or other person in

exterior surfaces should be maintained in a workmanlike state of maintenance
and repair and kept in such condition as to exclude rodents, other wild life,
or stray cats from taking up residence in the building.  Every exterior part of
such structures shall be free of holes, breaks, loose or rotting boards, and
any other condition which might admit rain or dampness to the interior portions
of the wall.
   (b)   Signs, Marquees and Awnings.  All marquees, signs, metal awnings,
stairways, fire escapes, standpipes, exhaust ducts and similar overhead
extensions shall be maintained in good repair and be properly anchored so as to
be kept in a safe and sound condition to provide public health and safety.
   (c)   Glass.  All windows should be fully equipped with glass or laminates,
except in vacant buildings, which may be boarded up, with boards painted to
match the buildings.
   (d)   Premises Condition.  All exterior property areas and premises shall be
maintained in clean, safe and sanitary condition free from any accumulation of
rubbish or garbage except in standard containers or storage areas.  It shall be
unlawful for the owner or occupant of any building, structure or property to
utilize the premises for the open storage of any abandoned appliances,
dismantled vehicles, and/or miscellaneous items which pose a threat to personal
safety or health.
   (e)   Vacant Structures and Land.  All vacant structures and premises
thereof or vacant land shall be maintained in a clean, safe, secure and
sanitary condition so as not to adversely affect the public health or safety. 
Vacant buildings must be locked to prevent vandals from entering.
      (Ord. 04-06.  Passed 3-9-04.)
1331.14  UNSAFE BUILDING ORDERS.
   (a)   A report of findings shall be prepared by the Engineer and/or health
department official and provided to the Village officials for review.  The

control of the building a written order herein referred to as an “Unsafe
Building Order”.  Such orders shall:
      (1)   Designate the building or structure;
      (2)   Describe the repairs or improvements required to render the
building or structure safe, secure, sanitary, and meeting minimum standards;
      (3)   Order that repairs or improvements be made within 30 days of
serving the order (or up to 90 days depending on the amount of work needing to
be done);
      (4)   State the penalties that will follow unless the work is done.
   (b)   If, due to weather, contractual problems, or other cause, there are
practical difficulties in carrying out the provisions of this code within the
specified time, the Village Administrator, and/or Zoning Inspector, and/or
Police Chief shall have the authority to grant modifications as long as such
modifications are in compliance with the intent and purpose of this code and do
not lessen health, life and safety requirements.  Details of the action
granting modification shall be recorded.
(Ord. 04-06.  Passed 3-9-04.)
1331.15  PROSECUTION.
   The Administrator may request the Village Solicitor to institute an
appropriate action or proceeding at law to exact the penalty provided in
Section
1331.99.
(Ord. 04-06.  Passed 3-9-04.)
1331.16  DEMOLITION OR REPAIR ORDERS.
   The Administrator or his designee may order the owner of premises which are
found by the engineer to be so out of repair as to be unsafe, dangerously
unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human occupancy or use, and unreasonably
costly to repair, to raze and remove at the owner’s expense.  Also where there
has been a cessation of normal construction of any structure for a period of
more than two years, the Administrator may order the structure to be razed and
removed.
   (a)   Unreasonable Repairs.  Whenever the registered engineer determines
that the cost of repairs would exceed 100 percent of the current value of such
structure, such repairs shall be presumed unreasonable and it shall be presumed
that the structure is a public nuisance, which may be ordered razed without
option on the part of the owner to repair.
   (b)   Order and Service.  The order shall be served on the owner of record
or an agent where an agent is in charge of the building and upon the holder of
any encumbrance of record.  The order shall specify repairs and a time in which
the owner shall comply.
      (Ord. 04-06.  Passed 3-9-04.)
1331.17  EMERGENCIES.
   In case of an emergency in the opinion of the Police Chief, Zoning Inspector
or Health Department official which involves immediate danger to human life or
health, the Administrator shall promptly cause an unsafe building structure or
portion thereof to be made safe or removed.  For this purpose, officials and
their assistants may enter such structures.  They may also order adjacent
structures and premises to be vacated if necessary to protect the public; and
may erect a fence around such structures and close a public or private way if
deemed necessary.
(Ord. 04-06.  Passed 3-9-04.)
1331.18  RESTRAINING ACTIONS.
   Anyone affected by any such order may within 10 days after service of such
order apply to the court of record for an order restraining the Village from
razing and removing such structure or parts thereof.  The court shall determine
whether the order of the Administrator is reasonable, and if found reasonable,
the court shall dissolve the restraining order, and if found not reasonable,
the court shall continue the restraining order or modify it as the
circumstances may required.
(Ord. 04-06.  Passed 3-9-04.)
1331.19  FAILURE TO COMPLY.
   Whenever the owner of a property fails to comply with a demolition order
within the time prescribed, the Village shall cause the structure or part
thereof to be razed and removed, either through an available public agency or
by contract or arrangement with private persons, and the cost of such work
shall be an obligation of the owner of the property and shall be charged
against the real estate so as to be a lien placed on the tax duplicate as
provided by Ohio R.C. 715.261.
(Ord. 04-06.  Passed 3-9-04.)
1331.20  SALVAGE MATERIALS.
   When any structure has been ordered razed and removed, the governing body or
designated officer under contract or arrangement aforesaid may sell the salvage
and valuable materials at the highest price obtainable.  The net proceeds of
such sale, after deducting the expenses of such razing and removal, shall be
promptly remitted with a report of such sale and transaction, including the
items of expenses and the amounts deducted, for the use of the property owner.
(Ord. 04-06.  Passed 3-9-04.)
1331.21  MEANS OF APPEAL.
   (a)   Any person who has been issued an order under this code has the right
to appeal to the Enon Village Council provided that a written appeal is filed
within 10 days after the notice or order was served.  An application for appeal
shall be based on a claim that:
      (1)   The true intent or the rules legally adopted thereunder have been
incorrectly interpreted; or
      (2)   The provisions of this code do not fully apply; or
      (3)   The requirements of this code are fully satisfied by other means;
or
      (4)   That strict application of any requirements of this code would

the right to appeal does not exist.
   (b)   At any time during the entire process the party/ies so notifies may
