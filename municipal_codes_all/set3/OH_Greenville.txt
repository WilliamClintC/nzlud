TABLE I - ZONING MAP CHANGES
EDITOR'S NOTE:  The City adopted a new comprehensive Zoning Code on June 1,
1999 (Ordinance 99-57). Because a new Zoning Map accompanies such Code, Zoning
Map changes predating June 1, 1999, are now superfluous and have thus been
deleted from this Table.  Changes to the new Zoning Map will be listed here as
they are adopted by Council.

214.01   ADOPTION OF POLICY.
   There is hereby adopted by and for the City this data processing security
policy, which policy shall be incorporated into the Personnel Policy Manual,
Employee Handbook and Travel Regulations, as adopted by Ordinance 91-134,
passed November 5, 1991. 
(Ord. 92-146.  Passed 10-6-92.)
214.02   INTENT.
   It is the intention of the City to provide computer equipment and software
for internal use for the purpose of reporting to management and making
operational data more meaningful.  To this end the City recommends wider use of
computer equipment and software for internal reporting and encourages greater
use of approved software packages for enhanced reporting.  All processing on
the computer must be within guidelines established by the City. 
(Ord. 93-45.  Passed 4-6-93.)
214.03   INVENTORY CONTROLS; DUTIES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS SUPERVISOR.
   The computing devices throughout the City are subject to inventory controls,
such as serial number recording, location information and periodic audits of
existence and condition.  The Information Systems Supervisor is responsible for
the computing devices in all locations and shall also be responsible for
inventory records.  A configuration listing, with serial numbers, shall be kept
on file.
(Ord. 93-45.  Passed 4-6-93.)
214.04   DESIGNATION OF RESPONSIBLE USERS.
   When a machine is installed within a department, the manager of that
department will designate a responsible user for the upkeep of information
concerning that machine.  Should the designated user be transferred or leave
the City, another user shall be identified immediately for the operational
responsibility of that machine.
(Ord. 93-45.  Passed 4-6-93.)
214.05   MAINTENANCE REQUEST PROCEDURES.
   When a problem occurs with a computer, the designated user shall contact the
Information Systems Supervisor.  Under no condition shall the user attempt to
repair the hardware.  The Information Systems Supervisor will assist in the
diagnosis of the problem and then be responsible to make a service call as
certain codes are given when service is requested.
(Ord. 93-45.  Passed 4-6-93.)
214.06   SUPPLIES.
   Various computer supplies shall be ordered by the Information Systems
Supervisor and distributed to designated users.  This shall be done to take
advantage of the best price available for needed supplies.
(Ord. 93-45.  Passed 4-6-93.)
214.07   RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPUTER SECURITY.
   (a)   Generally.  Security for computer applications and equipment shall be
the responsibility of the entire City.  It should be noted that even though the
data are on a hard-disk drive or on a diskette and in a desk drawer, it is as
vulnerable as any confidential printed report.
   (b)   Employees' Responsibilities.
      (1)   All employees of the City, regardless of title, are called upon to
provide for the security of resources, both physical and in the form of data,
which are at their disposal.  In addition, employees are responsible for
understanding established security standards as specified in Section 214.08. 
      (2)   Each employee will have a password.  This password is not to be
divulged to anyone.  The password is highly confidential, and should anyone
learn the password, a new one shall be assigned immediately.
      (3)   Users should return back to main menu when leaving their work area
or when leaving at the end of their shift.  This protects the user's data from
another person inquiring or modifying such data without the proper access
codes.  Returning back to main menu closes all data files and protects them
from being corrupted or erased.  Users shall be held accountable for system
activity performed with their user ID.
(Ord. 93-45.  Passed 4-6-93.)
214.08   COMPUTER SECURITY STANDARDS.
   (a)   Risk Assessment.
      (1)   Performing a risk assessment shall be the first step in applying
security measures to a given environment.  The Information Systems Supervisor
shall identify, inventory and classify assets by degree of security risk.
      (2)   This risk assessment should include the potential risks associated
with information output devices, whether in the form of diskettes, other
modems, on-line or local or remote printers.
   (b)   Physical Security.  The physical security of computer equipment shall
protect the power switch, plug and CPU.  Storage media shall be protected as
necessary in locked files or desk drawers.  All physical hardware shall be
inventoried and have an associated and unique serial number. 
(Ord. 93-45.  Passed 4-6-93.)
   (c)   Storage Media Protection.
      (1)   Storage media must be protected from accidental or malicious
destruction or tampering via regular back-up practices.  The best defense
involves management expectations and attention to user back-up performance.
      (2)   A back-up of the system will be performed daily and weekly. 
Departments will be notified in the morning that the system is "up" or
operational and then in the evening when the system is "down."  In order to
back-up the system, all departments shall cease input at the end of the day,
approximately 4:30 p.m. A weekly back-up will be performed on Thursday mornings
between the hours of 5:00 a.m and 7:30 a.m. 
(Ord. 96-166.  Passed 11-19-96.)
   (d)   Software Protection.  Software security requires protection against
unauthorized modifications or destruction of that software.  This includes
limiting access to application and system control program libraries to only
those authorized individuals.  All software back-ups are stored off-site at a
secured location.  Unauthorized duplication of City software will not be
sanctioned under any circumstances.
   (e)   Data Security.  Users are responsible for determining the nature and
importance of information for which they are responsible and to make optimum
use of such controls as exist.  These include access protection, such as
passwords, hard copy output and password protected software.
(Ord. 93-45.  Passed 4-6-93.)
   (f)   Access Security.
      (1)   Only authorized employees or authorized contractors shall have
access to the City's data processing equipment.  A City employee will have
access only for particular department functions.  Each personal computer must
have a password.  This password is not to be divulged to anyone, except
specified departmental employees.  This password is highly confidential, and
should anyone learn the password, a new one should be assigned immediately.
      (2)   A listing of codes for files which are the property of the City and
which are accessible only by a code shall be maintained by the Information
System Supervisor.
      (3)   Any employee who divulges passwords or allows access to the City's
equipment or software to nonemployees shall be subject to disciplinary action,
as may be appropriate.  Such disciplinary action may include dismissal from
employment. 
(Ord. 96-166.  Passed 11-19-96.)
   (g)   Screen and Log-Off Security.  The screen should not be viewed by the
public.  This should prevent the release of information or discourage
tampering.  The arrangement of any department shall include plans to have the
screen not within view of the public.  When leaving their work area, employees
shall log back to the main system menu.
(Ord. 93-45.  Passed 4-6-93.)
214.09   HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ACQUISITIONS.
   (a)   It is City policy that all acquisitions of computer hardware and
software be approved by the Information Systems Supervisor.  This will ensure
the consistency and compatibility of both hardware and software for the City.
   (b)   All outside software not purchased by the City must be approved by the
Information Systems Supervisor before being loaded into the City computer
system.  This protects the City from using any unauthorized software or
borrowed software. 
   (c)   No hardware that is not owned by the City shall be installed or used
with City-owned equipment.  The City shall not be responsible for non City-
owned equipment.
   (d)   Transfers of both hardware and software between departments must have
written approval from the Data Processing Manager and the Information Systems
Supervisor.
(Ord. 93-45.  Passed 4-6-93.)
214.10   REMOVING SOFTWARE/HARDWARE FROM CITY PREMISES.
   No employee shall authorize the removal of hardware or software from City
premises for private or personal use by any employee or non-employee.
(Ord. 93-45.  Passed 4-6-93.)
214.11   INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING COMPUTERS; PROTECTION OF COMPUTER FROM
UNAUTHORIZED USE.
   All employees who use the computer system shall be given instructions on the
equipment and software.  The safety of City equipment and software must always
be protected against unauthorized use and possible damage.
(Ord. 93-45.  Passed 4-6-93.)
214.12   CHANGES TO SOFTWARE.
   No employee shall make any changes, additions or maintenance to any of the
software packages used by the City.
(Ord. 93-45.  Passed 4-6-93.)
214.13   USE OF COPYRIGHTED COMPUTER SOFTWARE.
   The Administration of the City is committed to insuring that all computer
systems used by the City and its employees are fully legal and are being used
in an ethical and productive manner and, further, that all the pertinent
copyright requirements are honored with respect to any software and related
documentation contained on any of the individual systems, or over any networks
to which they may be connected.
   U.S.C. Title 17 is quite clear on the restrictions of copyright law, as well
as the penalty for the violation thereof.  It is understood that violations of
such law can result in civil damages and criminal penalties in the amount of
one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and/or five years imprisonment per
incident.
   It is the responsibility of each individual employee using any form of
copyrighted computer software and/or documentation, during the normal
performance of his or her duties and for whatever purpose, to insure that the
material is being used in an ethical and lawful manner.  Each employee is
encouraged to ascertain that each hardware instrument he or she is using has
the copyrighted software supported, where possible, by copies of the purchase
order paperwork, the software registration, the original disk and the original
operators manuals.  The collected materials must remain with the hardware, or
at an identified location, as long as the copyrighted material is resident
within the hardware.
   It is the responsibility of the individual employee using City-owned
hardware, software and related documentation to fully understand the legal
aspects of the copyright law with regard to site licenses, shareware, public
domain software, network licenses and archival copies.
   The City reserves the right to control and have access to the location of
the necessary software documentation as well as the configuration of any City-
owned hardware to protect the City's legal position.  The City reserves the
right to conduct an audit of computer software periodically.
   Software that is purchased with City funds must be registered in the City's
name and will remain the property of the City.  Employees of the City who make,
acquire, destroy or distribute copies, or who willfully allow for the making,
acquisition, destruction or distribution of copies, of City-owned, copyrighted
materials in an illegal manner, shall be subject to disciplinary action as may
be appropriate under the circumstances.  Likewise, misuse of the City's
equipment or materials in a non-productive manner during normal working hours
shall make the employee subject to disciplinary action as may be appropriate. 
Such disciplinary action may include dismissal from employment.  Recreational-
type software is not to be installed on City-owned equipment.
   No computer software shall be installed on City-owned equipment without the
prior written approval of the Data Processing Manager.  Such prohibition shall
be binding upon all employees of the City, including elected and appointed
officials thereof.

216.03   PROCUREMENT POLICY.
   (a)   Applicability of Policy.  Except as otherwise required by applicable
statute, or local law or resolution, the Director of Public Safety/Service and
other appointing authorities shall perform all duties required by law and shall
have the powers and duties prescribed by this policy in conjunction with the
procurement of goods, material, supplies, equipment, services and labor on
behalf of the City of Greenville, Ohio.  The term "Contracting Officer", as
used herein, shall include the Director of Public Safety/Service and all other
appointing authorities.
   (b)   Purchase Within Appropriation.  No goods, materials, supplies,
equipment, services, labor or other related procurement item shall be purchased
and/or contracted for purchase, and no financial liability therefor shall be
created, without first obtaining signed confirmation from the City Auditor that
sufficient funds are available to meet the financial liability anticipated to
be created by virtue of any such procurement.
   (c)   Duties and Powers of Contracting Officer or Officers.
      (1)   The Contracting Officer or a Contracting Officer shall assist all
of the department heads of the various departments of the City in the purchase
of goods, materials, supplies, equipment, services, labor, rentals and leases
in the manner set forth herein.
      (2)   Any amendment of this policy shall be in writing and promulgated
with the advice and approval of the Mayor, Auditor and Law Director.
      (3)   The Auditor shall prescribe and maintain such forms as are
reasonably necessary to the operation of this policy, or any regulations
promulgated under this policy.  Nothing herein shall be construed to contravene
the Auditor's right to establish the form of payment request required to be
submitted to initiate payment of a debt or obligation incurred under this
policy.
   (d)   Contracts, Material and Labor (ORC 735.05).
      (1)   The Director of Public Service, or contracting officer may make any
contract to purchase supplies or materials, to provide labor, or to provide
safety and service, involving not more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000)
and as previously included within the annual appropriations for the departments
under the Director's supervision. When an expenditure within the department,
other than the compensation of persons employed therein, exceeds fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000), the expenditure shall first be authorized and directed by
resolution or ordinance passed by City Council. When so authorized, the
Director of Public Service or Contracting Officer shall make a written contract
with the lowest and best bidder after advertisement for not less than two nor
more than four consecutive weeks in a newspaper in general circulation in the
City. Among the factors that may be considered in determining whether a bidder
is lowest and best include, but are not limited to, the bidder's experience,
the bidder's financial condition, the bidder's conduct and performance on
previous contracts, the bidder's management skills and the bidder's ability to
execute the contract properly.
      (2)   The form of contract to be referred in conjunction with any
procurement hereunder shall be as authorized by the Law Director.
      (3)   Prior to entering into any contract for, or authorizing the
acquisition of, any goods, materials, supplies, equipment, services, labor or
other related procurement items, a vendor's code shall be obtained from the
City Auditor and a purchase order submitted evidencing the anticipated fiscal
obligation to be so incurred.  The form of purchase order shall be as directed
by the City Auditor.  In certain instances, the use of blanket purchase orders
which are effective for ninety days may be appropriate in conjunction with
certain vendors, thus obviating the need for individual purchase orders for
each act performed or for goods, and services, etc., supplied by a vendor. The
City Auditor shall determine where the use of a various purchase order may be
permitted.
      (4)   The Contracting Officer or a Contracting Officer shall present to
the City Auditor all invoices, packing slips or other requests for payment,
upon the receipt thereof, to insure timely payment. Payment to vendors is
generally made two times per month and payment of vendor invoices shall be made
in accordance with such payment cycle, unless otherwise requested by the
Contracting Officer or a Contracting Officer and approved by the City Auditor.
      (5)   If formal action by City Council is required to authorize
procurement pursuant to this policy, no contract shall be entered into until
after the effective date of the relevant authorizing legislation, and no
contract shall be executed until the requested purchase order, under paragraph
(d)(3) hereof, has been requested, prepared and executed.
      (6)   Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) hereof, when the estimated
cost of supplies, materials, labor, service, etc., exceeds ten thousand dollars
($10,000), such expenditure shall first be authorized and directed by
resolution or ordinance passed by City Council.  When so authorized and
directed, except where the contract is for equipment, services, materials or
supplies to be purchased under Ohio R.C. 125.04, 715.23(D) or 5513.01, the
Contracting Officer or a Contracting Officer shall make a written contract with
the lowest and best bidder after advertisement for not less than two nor more
than four consecutive weeks in a newspaper in general circulation within the
City.
   (e)   Conditions Obviating Formal Bidding and Advertising for Contracts.
      (1)   In the case of a real and present emergency arising in connection
with the operation and maintenance of any department, division, commission,
bureau or board of the City, City Council may, by a two-thirds vote of all
members elected thereto, authorize the duly authorized contracting officer,
commission, board or authority to enter into a contract for work to be done or
for the purchase of supplies or materials without formal bidding.
      (2)   Subject to the requirement of authorization by Council for
procurement expenditures in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000), it shall
be unnecessary for the City to engage in the competitive bidding process for
the following:
         A.   Contracts for utility service, postage stamps or other goods,
services, material supplies or equipment, and for labor, where fixed prices
prevail;
         B.   Contracts for personal service of a specialized nature requiring
the exercise of peculiar skill and aptitude;

certain materials, if such purchases are made in accordance with the Ohio
Cooperative Purchasing Act (Ohio R.C. 125.04);

other articles, if such purchases are made in accordance with Ohio R.C. 5513.01
(B);
         E.   Contracts for the purchase of supplies, services, equipment or
materials if the City is participating in an existing valid and lawful contract
between a vendor and another Ohio county or municipality as an additional
purchaser from that vendor. The foregoing exception from the competitive
bidding requirements for the City shall apply only when the other Ohio county
or municipality which is a party to the contract has procured and entered into
such contract in accordance with the applicable competitive bidding provisions
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 307 in the case of a municipality, or a substantially
similar competitive bidding process adopted pursuant to the authority of the
other municipality under Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution
(Home Rule Amendment); or
         F.   When the Contracting Officer determines that only a single source
exists for the purchase of the relevant goods, materials, etc.
   (f)      Purchase of Used Equipment Without Bid. (ORC 735.052).  City
Council may authorize, by ordinance, a Contracting Officer or a board,
commission or authority to enter into a contract, without advertising and
bidding, for the purchase of used equipment or supplies at an auction open to
the public, or at a sale at which such used equipment or supplies are to be
sold upon submission of written bids to the vendor thereof where the vendor has
invited the public to submit written bids or when more than one bid is
submitted. The ordinance authorizing such contracts shall:
      (1)   Designate the authority of the officer, commission, board or other
contracting authority to make such contract;
      (2)   Set forth the maximum amount that may be bid as the purchase price
of such used equipment or supplies;
      (3)   Describe the type of used equipment or supplies that may be
purchased;
      (4)   Appropriate sufficient funds to meet the maximum amount that may be
bid as the purchase price for such used equipment or supplies, unless funds
have previously been appropriated for such purpose.
   (g)   Purchase From Other Subdivision Without Bid (ORC 735.053).  City
Council may authorize by ordinance a Contracting Officer or duly authorized
board, commission or authority to enter into a contract, without advertising
and bidding, for services or the purchase of material, equipment or supplies
from any department, division, agency or political subdivision as set forth in
Ohio R.C. 713.23(D).  The ordinance authorizing such contracts shall:
      (1)   Designate the authority of the officer, commission, board or other
contracting authority to make such contract;
      (2)   Set forth the maximum amount that may be bid as the purchase price
of such used equipment or supplies;
      (3)   Describe the type of used equipment or supplies that may be
purchased;
      (4)   Appropriate sufficient funds to meet the maximum amount that may be
bid as the purchase price for such used equipment or supplies, unless funds
have previously been appropriated for such purpose.
   (h)   Proceeding on Opening of Bids.  Bids for work under the supervision of
the Dpartment of Public Safety/Service shall be opened at the time, date and
place specified in the notice to bidders or specifications and shall be
publicly read by the Director of Public Safety/Service or a person designated
by such Director.  The time, place and date of bid openings may be extended to
a later date by the Director of Public Safety/Service, provided that written or
oral notice of the change shall be given to all persons who have received or
requested specifications no later than ninety-six hours prior to the original
time and date fixed for the opening.  Each bid shall contain the full name of
each person interested in it and shall be accompanied by a sufficient bond or
certified check, cashier's check or money order on a solvent bank or savings
and loan association that if the bid is accepted a contract will be entered
into and its performance properly secured, unless the bid is for a contract for
the construction, demolition, alteration, repair or reconstruction of a public
improvement, in which case it shall meet the requirements of Ohio R.C. 153.54. 
If the work bid  embraces both labor and material, such items shall be
separately stated with the price thereof. The director may reject any bid.
Where there is reason to believe there is collusion or combination among
bidders, the bids of those concerned therein shall be rejected.
   (i)      Contract Alterations or Modifications (ORC 735.07).  The contract
referred to in subsection (c) hereof shall be between the City and the bidder. 
Where a bonus is offered for completion of a contract prior to a specified
date, the City may exact a prorated penalty in like sum for every day of delay
beyond a specified date.
   When, in the opinion of the Contracting Officer or other duly authorized
contracting authority, it becomes necessary, in the prosecution of any work or
improvement under contract, to make modifications, the same shall only be made
upon the order of the City, but such order shall be of no effect until the
price to be paid for the work and material, or both, under the altered or
modified contract, has been agreed upon in writing and signed by the
Contracting Officer or a Contracting Officer or other duly authorized
contracting authority on behalf of the City and the contractor, and approved by
the Board of Control.
   No contractor may recover anything for work or material because of any such
alteration or modification unless the contract is made in such manner as to
authorize the same, nor shall he or she be allowed to recover for such work and
material, or either, more than the agreed price.  The law relating to the
requirement of bids and the awarding of contracts for public buildings and
improvements, so far as it applies, shall remain in full force and effect.
   (j)   Execution of Contracts (ORC 735.09).
      (1)   All contracts made by the City shall be executed by the Contracting
Officer or other authorized contracting authority in the name of the City.  One
copy shall be filed in his or her office and the original with the City
Auditor.  No contract of modification thereto shall be signed by the
Contracting Officer or other authorized contracting authority unless it has
been approved as to form by the Law Director or the Law Director's designee. No
liability shall be created against the City as to any matters under the
supervision of such Director, except by the said Director's express authority.
      (2)   No City employee shall be interested in any contract made with the
City.
      (3)   No contract shall be awarded under this section unless the
contractor has agreed in writing to permit the City Auditor or the Auditor's
designee to inspect and copy at all reasonable times all of the financial
records in the possession or control of the contractor which pertain in any way
to the contract in question.
      (4)   Notwithstanding payment of the full purchase price or contract
price, the performance bond, if applicable, shall not be released, and
acceptance of the performance shall not be deemed to have been made, until the
goods, materials, work product, etc., have been fully inspected and found to
comply in all respects with the specifications therefor, and until any required
maintenance bond has been properly posted with the City.
      (5)   No department head, supervisor or employee shall be authorized to
accept performance unless a determination has been made that all contract
specifications have been satisfactorily met and that the requisite maintenance
bond, if applicable, has been posted.
      (6)   When deemed necessary by the Law Director, a contract shall provide
satisfactory evidence of the existence of a comprehensive policy of general
liability insurance coverage, in an amount specified by the bidding or other
relevant documents, or as specified by the Law Director, naming therein the
City of Greenville, Ohio, as an additional insured thereon, to provide
indemnity against liability in the performance of the relevant contract.
   (k)   Award and Execution of Contracts; Price; Partial Payments (ORC
153.12).
      (1)   With respect to the award of any contract for the construction,
reconstruction, improvement, enlargement, alteration, repair, painting or
decoration of a public improvement made by the City, the award and execution of
the contract shall be made within sixty days after the date on which the bids
are opened.  The failure to award and execute the contract within sixty days
invalidates the entire bid proceedings and all bids submitted, unless the time
for awarding and executing the contract is extended by mutual consent of the
City and the bidder whose bid the City accepts and with respect to whom the
City subsequently awards and executes a contract.  The bid for which the award
is to be made shall be opened at the time and place named in the advertisement
for bids, unless extended by the City or unless, within ninety-six hours prior
to the published time for the opening of bids, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and
legal holidays, any modification of the plans or specifications and estimates
of the cost for the project for which bids are solicited is issued and mailed
or otherwise furnished to persons who have obtained plans or specifications for
the project, for which the time for opening of bids shall be extended one week,
with no further advertising of bonds required. The contractor, upon request, is
entitled to a notice to proceed with the work by the City upon execution of the
contract.
      No contract to which this section applies shall be entered into if the
price of the contract, or, if the project involves multiple contracts, where
the total price of all contracts for the project, is in excess of ten percent
above the entire estimate thereof, nor shall the entire cost of the
construction, reconstruction, repair, painting, decorating, improvement,
alteration, addition or installation, including changes and estimates of
expense for architects or engineers, exceed in the aggregate the amount
authorized by law.
      The unit or lump sum price stated in the contract shall be used in
determining the amount to be paid and shall constitute full and final
compensation for all the work.
      (2)   Partial payment to the contractor for work performed under the lump
sum price shall be based on a schedule prepared by the contractor and approved
by the architect or engineer who shall apportion the lump sum price to the
major components entering into or forming a part of the work under the lump sum
price. Further, partial payments for labor performed under either a unit or
lump sum contract shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the Ohio
Revised Code as to the retainage of contract payments, creation of escrow
accounts and payment of retainer funds.
   (l)      Bid Guaranties on Construction Contracts (ORC 153.54).
      (1)   Each person bidding for a contract with the City, for the
construction, demolition, alteration, repair or reconstruction of any public
improvement, is required to file with the bid a bid guaranty in the form of
either:
         A.   A bond in accordance with paragraph (l)(2) hereof for the full
amount of the bid;
         B.   A certified check, cashier's check or letter of credit pursuant
to Ohio R.C. Chapter 1305, in accordance with paragraph (l)(3) hereof.  Any
such letter of credit shall be revocable only at the option of the City. The
amount of the certified check, cashier's check or letter of credit shall be
equal to ten percent of the bid.
      (2)   A bid guaranty filed pursuant to paragraph (l)(1) hereof shall be
conditioned to:
         A.   Provide that if the bid is accepted, the bidder will, after the
awarding or the recommendation for the award of the contract, whichever the
City designates, enter into a proper contract in accordance with the bid,
plans, details, specifications and bills of material. If, for any reason, the
bidder fails to enter into the contract, and the City awards the contract to
the next lowest bidder, the bidder and the surety on such bidder's bond shall
be liable to the City for the difference between such bidder's bid and that of
the next lowest bidder, or for a penal sum not to exceed ten percent of the
amount of the bond, whichever is less.
            If the City does not award the contract to the next lowest bidder,
but resubmits the project for bidding, the bidder failing to enter into the
contract and the surety on his or her bond shall be liable to the City for a
penal sum not to exceed ten percent of the amount of the bid or the costs in
connection with the resubmission of printing new contract documents, required
advertising, and printing and mailing notices to prospective bidders, whichever
is less.
         B.   Indemnify the City against all damage suffered by failure to
perform the contract according to its provisions and in accordance with the
plans, details, specifications and bills of material therefor and to pay all
lawful claims of subcontractors, materialmen and laborers for labor performed
or material furnished in carrying forward, performing or completing the
contract; and agree and assent that this undertaking shall be for the benefit
of any subcontractor, materialman or laborer having a just claim, as well as
for the City.
      (3)   A bid guaranty filed pursuant to paragraph (l)(1)B. hereof shall be
conditioned to provide that if the bid is accepted, the bidder will, after the
awarding or the recommendation for the award of the contract, whichever the
City designates, enter into a proper contract in accordance with the bid,
plans, details, specifications and bills of material.  If, for any reason, the
bidder fails to enter into the contract, and the City awards the contract to
the next lowest bidder, the bidder shall be liable to the City for the
difference between his or her bid and that of the next lowest bidder, or for a
penal sum not to exceed ten percent of the amount of the bid, whichever is
less.  If the City does not award the contract to the next lowest bidder, but
resubmits the project for bidding, the bidder failing to enter into the
contract shall be liable to the City for a penal suhall be determi ten n like
manner.
      (4)   Notwithstanding paragraph (l)(3) hereof, where the City resubmits
the project for bidd
         If the bidder enters into the contract, the bidder shall, at the time
the bidder enters into the contract, file a bond for the amount of the contract
to indemnify the City against all damage suffered by failure to perform the
contract according to its provisions and in accordance with the plans, details,
specifications and bills of material therefor and to pay all lawful claims of
subcontractors, materialmen and laborers for labor performed or material
furnished in carrying forward, performing or completing the contract; and agree
and assent that this undertaking shall be for the benefit of any subcontractor,
materialman or laborer having a just claim, as well as for the City.
      (5)   Where the City accepts a bid but the bidder fails or refuses to
enter into a proper contract in accordance with the bid plans, details,
specifications and bills of material within ten days after the awarding of the
contract, the bidder and the surety on any bond shall be liable for the amount
of the difference between the high bid and that of the next lowest bidder, and
if such next lowest bidder also fails or refuses to enter into a proper
contract in accordance with the bid, plans, details, specifications and bills
of material within ten days after the awarding of the contract, the liability
of such next lowest bidder shall be the amount of the difference between the
bids of such next lowest bidder and the third lowest bidder, but not in excess
of liability specified in paragraph (l)(2) or (3) hereof. Liability on account
of an award to any lowest bidder beyond the third lowest bidder shall be
determined in like manner.
      (6)   Notwithstanding paragraph (l)(3) hereof, where the City resubmits
the project for bidding, each bidder whose bid was accepted but who failed or
refused to enter into a proper contract shall be liable for an equal share of a
penal sum in connection with the resubmission of printing new contract
documents, required advertising, and printing and mailing notices to
prospective bidders, but no bidder's liability shall exceed the amount of his
or her bid guaranty.
      (7)   All bid guaranties filed pursuant to this section shall be payable
to the City, shall be for the benefit of the City, or any person having a right
of action thereon, and shall be deposited with and held by the City Auditor.
All bonds filed pursuant to this section shall be issued by a surety company
authorized to do business in the State as surety and approved by the Law
Director.
   (m)   Withdrawing Bids Made in Error on Construction Contracts (ORC 9.31).
      (1)   A bidder for a contract with the City, for the construction,
demolition, alteration, repair or reconstruction of any public building,
structure, highway or other improvement, may withdraw his or her bid from
consideration if the price bid was substantially lower than the other bids,
provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the reason for the price bid
being substantially lower was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment
mistake, and was actually due to an unintentional and substantial arithmetic
error or an unintentional omission of a substantial quantity of work, labor or
material made directly in the compilation of the bid.  Notice of a claim of
right to withdraw such bid must be made in a writing filed with the City within
two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure.
      (2)   No bid may be withdrawn under this subsection when the result would
be the awarding of the contract on another bid of the same bidder.
      (3)   No bidder who is permitted to withdraw a bid shall, for
compensation, supply any material or labor to, or perform any subcontract or
other work agreement for, the person to whom the contract is awarded, or
otherwise benefit, directly or indirectly, from the performance of the project
for which the withdrawn bid was submitted, without the approval of the City. 
The person to whom the contract was awarded and the withdrawing bidder are
jointly liable to the City in an amount equal to any compensation paid to or
for the benefit of the withdrawing bidder without such approval, in addition to
the penalty provided in Ohio R.C. 2913.31.
      (4)   If a bid is withdrawn under authority of this section, the City may
award the contract to the next lowest bidder or reject all bids and resubmit
the project for bidding. In the event the City resubmits the project for
bidding, the withdrawing bidder shall pay the costs, in connection with the
resubmission, of printing new contract documents, required advertising, and
printing and mailing notices to prospective bidders, if the City finds that
such costs would not have been incurred but for such withdrawal.
      (5)   The City, if it intends to contest the right of a bidder to
withdraw a bid, shall hold a hearing thereon within ten days after the opening
of such bids and issue any order allowing or denying the claim of such right
within five days after such hearing is concluded. The City shall give to the
withdrawing bidder timely and reasonable notice of the time and place of any
such hearing. The City shall make a stenographic record of all testimony, other
evidence and rulings on the admissibility of evidence presented at the hearing.
The bidder shall pay the costs of the hearing.
      (6)   In the event the City denies the claim for withdrawal and the
bidder elects to appeal or otherwise refuses to perform, the City may reject
all bids or award to the next lowest bidder.
   (n)   Performance Bonds (ORC 153.57).  The bond provided for in Ohio R.C.
153.54(C) shall be in substantially the following form:

                          , which said contract is made a part of this bond the
same as though set forth herein;
   Now, if the said                      shall well and faithfully do and
perform the things agreed by to be done and performed according to the terms of
said contract; and shall pay all lawful claims of subcontractors, materialmen
and laborers, for labor performed and materials furnished in the carrying
forward, performing or completing of said contract; we agreeing and assenting
that this undertaking shall be for the benefit of any materialman or laborer
having a just claim, as well as for the obligee herein; then this obligation
shall be void; otherwise the same shall remain in full force and effect; it
being expressly understood and agreed that the liability of the surety for any
and all claims hereunder shall in no event exceed the penal amount of this
obligation as herein stated.
   The said surety hereby stipulates and agrees that no modifications,
omissions or additions in or to the terms of the said contract or in or to the
plans or specifications therefor shall in any wise affect the obligations of
said surety on its bond."
   (o)   Form of Bid Bond (ORC 153.571).  The bond provided for in Ohio R.C.
153.54(B) shall be in substantially the following form:
   "KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, that we, the undersigned                  
     as principal and                  as sureties, are hereby held and firmly
bound unto                     as obligee in the penal sum of the dollar amount
of the bid submitted by the principal to the obligee on                        
   to undertake the project known as                   . The penal sum referred
to herein shall be the dollar amount of the principal's bid to the obligee,
incorporating any additive or deductive alternative proposals made by the
principal on the date referred to above to the obligee, which are accepted by
the obligee. In no case shall the penal sum exceed the amount of              
   
   dollars. (If the foregoing blank is not filled in, the penal sum will be the
full amount of the principal's bid, including alternatives. Alternatively, if
the blank is filled in, the amount stated must not be less than the full amount
of the bid, including alternatives, in dollars and cents. A percentage is not

   Signed this        day of             19  .
   THE CONDITION OF THE ABOVE OBLIGATION IS SUCH that whereas the above named
principal has submitted a bid for                 .
   Now, therefore, if the obligee accepts the bid of the principal and the
principal fails to enter into a proper contract in accordance with the bid,
plans, details, specifications and bills of material; and in the event the
principal pays to the obligee the difference, not to exceed ten percent of the
penalty hereof, between the amount specified in the bid and such larger amount
for which the obligee may in good faith contract with the next lowest bidder to
perform the work covered by the bid, or in the event the obligee does not award
the contract to the next lowest bidder and resubmits the project for bidding,
the principal pays to the obligee the difference, not to exceed ten percent
(10%) of the penalty hereof, between the amount specified in the bid, or the
costs, in connection with the resubmission, of printing new contract documents,
required advertising, and printing and mailing notices to prospective bidders,
whichever is less, then this obligation shall be null and void, otherwise to
remain in full force and effect; if the obligee accepts the bid of the
principal, and the principal, within ten (10) days after the awarding of the
contract, enters into a proper contract in accordance with the bid, plans,
details, specifications and bills of material, which said contract is made a
part of this bond the same as though set forth herein;
   Now also, if the said              shall well and faithfully do and perform
the things agreed by     to be done and performed according to the terms of
said contract; and shall pay all lawful claims of subcontractors, materialmen
and laborers, for labor performed and materials furnished in the carrying
forward, performing or completing of said contract; we agreeing and assenting
that this undertaking shall be for the benefit of any materialman or laborer
having a just claim, as well as for the obligee herein; then this obligation
shall be void; otherwise the same shall remain in full force and effect; it
being expressly understood and agreed that the liability of the surety for any
and all claims hereunder shall in no event exceed the penal amount of this
obligation as herein stated.
   The said surety hereby stipulates and agrees that no modifications,
omissions or additions in or to the terms of the said contract or in or to the
plans or specifications therefor shall in any wise affect the obligations of
said surety on its bonds.

appropriation has been made pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5705.
   (q)   Public Information (ORC 149.43).  Procurement information shall be a
public record to the extent provided in Ohio R.C. 149.43 and shall be available

      (1)   No public official shall knowingly do any of the following:
         A.   Authorize, or employ the authority or influence of his or her
office to secure authorization of, any public contract in which he or she, a
member of his or her family, or any of his or her business associates, has an
interest;
         B.   Authorize, or employ the authority or influence of his or her
office to secure, the investment of public funds in any share, bond, mortgage
or other security, with respect to which he or she, a member of his or her
family, or any of his or her business associates, either has an interest, is an
underwriter, or receives any brokerage, origination or servicing fees;
         C.   During his or her term of office or within one year thereafter,
occupy any position of profit in the prosecution of a public contract
authorized by him or her or by a legislative body, commission or board of which
he or she was a member at the time of authorization, unless the contract was
let by competitive bidding to the lowest and best bidder;
         D.   Have an interest in the profits or benefits of a public contract
entered into by or for the use of the political subdivision or governmental
agency or instrumentality with which he or she is connected;
         E.   Have an interest in the profits or benefits of a public contract
that is not let by competitive bidding if required by law and that involves
more than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
      (2)   In the absence of bribery or a purpose to defraud, a public
official, member of his or her family, or any of his or her business
associates, shall not be considered as having an interest in a public contract
or the investment of public funds, if all of the following apply:
         A.   The interest of that person is limited to owning or controlling
shares of the corporation, or being a creditor of the corporation or other
organization, that is the contractor on the public contract involved, or that
is the issuer of the security in which public funds are invested;
         B.   The shares owned or controlled by that person do no exceed five
percent of the outstanding shares of the corporation, and the amount due that
person as creditor does not exceed five percent of the total indebtedness of
the corporation or other organization;
         C.   That person, prior to the time the public contract is entered
into, files with the political subdivision or governmental agency or
instrumentality involved, an affidavit giving his or her exact status in
connection with the corporation or other organization.
      (3)   This subsection does not apply to a public contract in which a
public official, member of his or her family, or one of his or her business
associates has an interest, when all of the following apply:
         A.   The subject of the public contract is necessary supplies or
services for the political subdivision or governmental agency or
instrumentality involved;
         B.   The supplies or services are unobtainable elsewhere for the same
or lower cost, or are being furnished to the political subdivision or
governmental agency or instrumentality as part of a continuing course of
dealing established prior to the public official's becoming associated with the

         C.   The treatment accorded the political subdivision or governmental

instrumentality involved, of the interest of the public official, member of his
or her family, or business associate, and the public official takes no part in
the deliberations or decision of the political subdivision or governmental
agency or instrumentality with respect to the public contract.

employee otherwise qualifies for the program and does not use the authority or
influence of his or her office or employment to secure benefits from the

employee. Such participation does not constitute an unlawful interest in a
public contract in violation of this subsection.

interest in a public contract.  Violation of paragraph (r)(1)A. or B. hereof is
a felony of the fourth degree.  Violation of paragraph (r)(1)C., D. or E.

2921.421, for a chief legal officer of a municipal corporation or an official
designated as prosecutor in a municipal corporation to appoint assistants and

law director appointed under Ohio R.C. 504.15 to appoint assistants and

and safe average rate of return over the course of budgetary and economic

requirements.
      (3)   The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to enable
the City to meet reasonable anticipated operating requirements.
      (4)   The investment portfolio should be diversified in order to avoid
incurring potential losses on individual securities which may not be held to
maturity whether by erosion of market value or change in market conditions.
      (5)   Investments shall be made with the exercise of that degree of
judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of
prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own
affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, the probable safety of their
capital and the probable income to be derived.
      (6)   Bank account relationships will be managed in order to secure
adequate services while minimizing costs.
   (b)   Authorized Institutions and Dealers.  A list of authorized
institutions and dealers shall be maintained with the investing authority. 
Additions and deletions to this list shall be made when deemed in the best
interest of the investing authority.  Only those institutions eligible under
the laws of the State shall be used as public depositories.  The City may
engage the services of an investment advisor to assist in the management of the
investment portfolio in a manner consistent with this investment policy. Such
investment advisor may be granted discretion to purchase and sell investment
securities in accordance with this investment policy. The investment advisor
must be licensed by the division of securities under R.C. § 1707.141 or
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and possess experience
in public funds investment management specifically in the area of state and
local government investment portfolios, or the investment advisor is an
eligible institution as mentioned in R.C. Chapter 135. The investment advisor
must enter into a written investment advisory agreement with the City. In
addition, the investment advisor must supply a copy of their Form ADV Part 2,
or make a copy available, on an annual basis.
   (c)   Term of Investments.  To the extent possible, the City will match its
investments with anticipated cash flow requirements.  Unless matched to a
specific cash flow requirement, the City will not directly invest in securities
maturing more than five years from the date of purchase.
   (d)   Authorized Investments.  The City may invest in any instrument or
security authorized under the laws of the State.
   (e)   Collateral Required.  All deposits shall be collateralized pursuant to
the Ohio Revised Code.
   (f)   Inventory of Obligations and Securities. The investing authority shall
establish and maintain an inventory of all obligations and securities acquired
by the investing authority.  The inventory shall include a description of the
security, type, cost, par value, maturity date, settlement date and coupon
rate.
   (g)   Agreement of Institutions and Dealers to Abide by Policy.  Pursuant to
the Ohio Revised Code, all brokers, dealers and financial institutions
initiating transactions with the City by giving advice or making investment
policy, or executing transactions initiated by the City, must acknowledge their
agreement to abide by the investment policy's content.

(Ord. 91-82.  Passed 7-16-91.)
252.04   SICK LEAVE.
   (a)   Generally.  All full-time employees of the City and all regular part-
time employees, as the same are defined in Section
252.08, shall be entitled to sick leave in accordance with the following
schedule:
      (1)   Less than four calendar weeks or one calendar month, at the rate of
0.0577 of an hour for every regularly scheduled hour worked; and
      (2)   Four calendar weeks or one calendar month, as follows:
         A.   8.750 hours of credit for those employees who work a 35.0 hour
work week;
         B.   9.375 hours of credit for those employees who work a 37.5 hour
work week; and
         C.   10.0 hours of credit for those employees who work a 40.0 hour
work week.
   Employees may use sick leave, upon approval of the responsible Municipal
administrative officer, for absence due to personal illness, pregnancy, injury
and exposure to a contagious disease which could be communicated to other
employees, and to illness, injury or death in the employee's immediate family.
For purposes of this section, “immediate family” means a mother, father, son,
daughter, spouse, legal guardian or other person who stands in the place of a
parent (i.e. in loco parentis).  Unused sick leave shall be cumulative without
limit.  When sick leave is used, it shall be deducted from the employee's
credit on the basis of one hour for every hour of absence from previously
scheduled work.  Upon transfer from one division or department within the City
to another division or department within the City, unused sick leave credits
shall continue to be available for the transferred employee's use.  An employee
using sick leave shall furnish to his or her supervisor a satisfactory written,
signed statement to justify the use of sick leave.  If medical attention is
required, a certificate stating the nature of the illness from a licensed
physician shall be required to justify the use of sick leave.  An employee
experiencing a disabling illness or off-duty injury shall, when physically
possible, report that fact to his or her supervisor at least one-half hour
before the commencement of such employee's shift on the first day of the
employee's absence.  The employee's supervisor may make an additional call to
the employee when the supervisor needs additional information.  The employee or
a member of such employee's immediate family shall call the supervisor on each
succeeding work day that the employee is ill.  Falsification of either a
written, signed statement, a physician's certificate or a report of illness
shall be grounds for disciplinary action, including the withholding of benefits
and dismissal.  Only full-time or regular part-time employees who are granted a
leave of absence with pay for sick leave or injury leave shall continue to
accrue sick leave at the regularly prescribed rate during such absence, but
such accrual shall not be available to an employee until such employee returns
from leave for a period not less than one day.  Sick leave credits shall not
accrue during periods of suspension or other types of disciplinary leave
without pay of six days or more in duration or during periods of military
leave.  Sick leave may be used for doctor appointments subject however, to all
other restrictions as to approvals and minimum/maximum amounts provided for in
this Code of Ordinances, Personnel Policy Manual and/or Collective Bargaining
Agreements.
   (b)   Reinstatement Credit.  An employee who had previously accumulated sick
leave credit under the provisions of this section shall, upon re-employment
with the City, have restored all unused sick leave credit which was not
converted to a cash benefit as provided for herein, or any other conversion
provisions, provided that such employee is re-employed within ten years.
   (c)   Regular Part-Time Employees.  Regular part-time employees, as the same
are defined in Section
252.08, shall earn sick leave at the rate of 0.0577 of an hour for every
regularly scheduled hour worked.
   (d)   Sick Leave Credit Remaining at End of Year.
      (1)   An employee who is credited with sick leave may elect one of the
following options with respect to sick leave credit remaining at the end of the
calendar year:
         A.   Carry-forward the balance; or
         B.   Receive a cash benefit.  An employee who has sick leave credit
remaining at the end of the calendar year in excess of 480 hours may convert
such sick leave credit in excess of 480 hours at the rate of one hour of the
employee's base rate of pay in effect as of the date of application for every
three hours of unused credit over 480 hours, to a maximum of forty hours of
pay.  Such conversion may occur only one time per calendar year.
      (2)   An employee selecting the option described in division (d)(1)B. of
this section shall indicate such selection, in writing, on a form issued by the

each calendar year.  Failure to exercise such option, in writing, by the last
date available therefor, shall result in the automatic carry-forward of any
unused balance.
      (3)   Cash benefits will be paid the same pay period that includes
November 20.
      (4)   An employee who separates during the year, prior to November 1 of

   (e)   Payment for Accumulated Sick Leave Upon Separation.
      (1)   Employees who have accumulated sick leave may, at their request, be
paid for a percentage of their accumulated balances upon termination from
service to the City, other than upon retirement, at their last base rate of pay
at the rate of one hour of pay for every two hours of accumulated balance for
those days between 30 and 120, to a maximum of 45 days of pay, based upon the
employee's normal work day.
      (2)   In order to be eligible for the payment authorized by this
division, an employee shall have at least one year of service with the City.

in accordance with divisions (e)(1) and (2) of this section, shall make written
application for such payment prior to such termination using a form issued by
the City Auditor for such purpose.  If an employee is terminated for cause,
such written application shall be made not more than ten days after the date of
such termination. Failure to make a timely application shall result in the
forfeiture of the accumulated sick leave credit.

eliminate any future demands for payment for any remaining accumulated sick
leave credit.
   (f)   Payment for Unused Sick Leave Upon Retirement.

to be paid in cash for the value of his or her accrued but unused sick leave
credit at the rate of two sick leave credits (i.e. days) for one day of regular
pay.  Payment for sick leave on this basis shall be based on the employee's
rate of pay at the time of retirement. Payment for sick leave on this basis
shall be considered to eliminate all sick leave credit accrued by the employee
at that time.  Such payment shall be made only once to any employee.  The
maximum payment which may be made under this division is for 45 days.
      (3)   An employee who retires and elects to convert his or her sick leave

two hours of accumulated balance, to a maximum of 60 days of pay.
   In order to be eligible for the payment authorized by this division, an
employee shall have had at least one year of service with the City.

      (3)   For purposes of divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) above,"active pay
status" shall mean all regularly scheduled hours actually worked by the
employee plus any hours the employee is on an approved leave paid directly by
the City (i.e. vacation, sick leave, personal leave, etc.), but excluding any
additional hours worked outside the employee's regular work schedule or any
time the employee is not being paid directly by the City.
   (c)   Part-Time Employees. Part-time employees are not entitled to vacation
except where otherwise authorized by City ordinance. Where authorized, vacation
accrual will be on a prorated basis. Part-time employees should check with the
City Auditor to see if they are entitled to vacation leave.
   (d)   Utilization of Leave. Annual vacation leave shall be taken at such
time as the department head or appointing authority approves and is subject to
the department head's or appointing authority's administrative discretion. All
vacation leave must be requested and authorized on a form designated by the
City Auditor.
   During calendar year 1999, employees may utilize their vacation as it is
accrued. However, effective January 1, 2000, each regular employee shall be
credited with all unused vacation accrued in accordance with this policy
through December 31, 1999, for use during calendar year 2000.
   Vacation credited to an employee's account on January 1 shall be for use
during that same calendar year. Each January 1 thereafter, each regular
employee's vacation account shall be credited with the appropriate number of
weeks of vacation accrued during the previous calendar year for use during the
current calendar year.
   Newly hired employees shall be credited with two weeks of vacation on
January 1 following their most recent date of hire or upon completion of six
months of service, whichever occurs later. Each January 1 thereafter, the
employee's vacation account shall be credited with the appropriate number of
weeks of vacation accrued during the previous calendar year for use during the
current calendar year. Newly hired employees may schedule vacation as soon as
it has been credited to their account, provided that each employee must repay
such vacation time if the employee's employment is terminated for any reason
prior to the employee completing one year of service with the City. Such
repayment may be withheld from the employee's final paycheck or collected by
other means if sufficient funds are not thus available.
   Effective January 1, 2000, no accrued vacation shall be used by any employee
until such vacation has been credited to the employee's vacation account on
January 1.
   Beginning in the year 2000, on January 1 of each year in which an employee
will complete eight, 15 or 20 years of service, the employee shall be credited
with one additional week of vacation at the start of that calendar year and
begin accruing vacation for the following calendar year at the appropriate rate
as specified in division (a) above. The employee shall repay the City for this
additional week of vacation if the employee's employment is terminated for any
reason prior to the employee actually completing the required years of service
for the additional week of vacation. Such repayment may be withheld from the
employee's final paycheck or collected by other means if sufficient funds are
not thus available.
   (e)   Interpretation and Record. A calendar vacation week shall be
considered as the amount of time an employee is normally scheduled to work
during a seven-day period. Two calendar vacation weeks shall consist of ten
working days for a full-time employee. Vacation leave shall not accrue during
any non-pay status.
   (f)   Vacation Scheduling. Each employee entitled to vacation will schedule
vacation through the department head, or the appointing authority if the
employee reports directly to such official, according to the scheduling
requirements of the department.
   Vacation shall be scheduled in full-day, half-day or one-hour increments
subject to the staffing requirements of the employer as determined by the
department head. All earned, but unused vacation leave, remaining at the end of
a calendar year, which exists to the benefit of an affected employee in an
amount of less than one full hour shall be resolved by way of cash equivalent
payment by the City to the affected employee.
   (g)   Time Limit; Exceptions. Effective January 1, 2000, vacation leave
credited to an employee's vacation account on January 1 shall be used by the
employee prior to the end of the same calendar year or such vacation leave
shall be deemed forfeited. Exceptions to this provision may be made only due to
extenuating circumstances as recommended by the department head and approved by
the Director of Public Safety and Service or the Mayor. Exceptions to this
provision may be made only due to extenuating circumstances as recommended by
the relevant department head and approved by the relevant appointing authority.
   (h)   Separation From Service. Upon separation from active service with the
City, an employee shall be entitled to compensation for the prorated portion of
any earned but unused vacation leave as allowable under the Ohio Revised Code
at the time of separation. This provision shall not apply to those employees
who have less than one year of service with the City.
   The vacation payable in accordance with this division shall include any
unused vacation credited to the employee's account the previous January 1, plus
the prorated portion of vacation earned from January 1 until the date of
separation.
   (i)   Deceased Employee. In the case of the death of an employee who is on
the City's payroll at the time of death, the prorated portion of any earned but
unused vacation leave shall be paid in accordance with Ohio R.C. 2113.04 or to
the estate of the deceased employee.
   The vacation payable in accordance with this division shall include any
unused vacation credited to the employee's account the previous January 1, plus
the prorated portion of vacation earned from January 1 until the date of death.
   (j)   Planning of Leave. Vacation must be planned as far in advance as
possible so as not to interfere with the efficient operation of the department.
The department head shall schedule vacations in accordance with the workload
requirements of the department and may deny vacation requests if workload
requirements so mandate. Employees who report directly to an appointing
authority shall submit their vacation leave requests to such appointing
authority for approval.
   (k)   Record of Leave. A record shall be maintained for each employee
showing the balance of vacation leave credited to the employee's account for
use during the current calendar year. Vacation credited to the employee's
account for use during the current calendar year will be reported on an
employee's paycheck each pay period. It is the responsibility of the employee
to check these balances and to report any discrepancies to the department head
or appointing authority within one month after receipt of the paycheck.
   (l)   Seniority Dates. Seniority for the purpose of calculating the amount
of vacation an employee is entitled to shall be determined according to the
total full-time prior service an employee has with the City of Greenville for
those employees hired on or after July 5, 1987. Seniority for the purpose of
calculating the amount of vacation an employee who was hired by the City of
Greenville prior to July 5, 1987, is entitled to, shall include all previous
full-time service with the City of Greenville, the State of Ohio or any other
political subdivision thereof. In either case, prior service need not be
continuous.
   Employees who have retired in accordance with the provisions of the PERS or
any other retirement plan offered by the State of Ohio and who are hired by the
City of Greenville on or after July 5, 1987, shall not have their prior service
with the City, the State, or any political subdivision thereof, counted for the
purpose of determining the amount of vacation leave the employee is entitled
to. Vacation leave for such employees shall be based only upon the service the
employee is currently accruing with the City of Greenville.
   (m)   Corrections in Vacation Balances. It is the responsibility of the City
Auditor to make any necessary corrections in vacation balances within one month
following notification by the department head or appointing authority that an
error exists or to notify the employee that no change is warranted.

   (a)   Generally.  City employees and officials will be permitted to travel

expenses incurred while traveling out of the City on official City business
will be made, provided that approval for such travel and request for travel
expense reimbursement are made and requested as hereinafter provided.
   (b)   Authorization.  No City official or employee will be permitted to
travel out of the City, and no reimbursement for travel expenses incurred will
be made, unless the employee or official has obtained prior written approval

travel expenses.  All requests for travel expenses shall be initiated by the
submittal of a written request for out-of-City travel on an appropriate
approved City form.
   (c)   Exceptions to Prior Written Authorization.  No such prior written
authorization shall be required to be obtained under the following conditions
and pursuant to the following circumstances:
      (1)   When the need to accomplish such out-of-City travel is of sudden or
unexpected nature and time does not allow for the acquisition of such prior
approval, and such exigent circumstances are subsequently acknowledged by the
Mayor and certified by the Auditor that funds are available to pay for such
travel expenses incurred; and
      (2)   When the out-of-City travel is within the expected and ordinary
course of the employee's or official's scope of employment or representation,
and the employee's or official's immediate supervisor, if any, has required
that such out-of-City travel be accomplished.

travel, or when travel time is of paramount significance. In no event, however,
shall such payment for air travel exceed the cost of coach air fare.
(Ord. 92-01.  Passed 2-4-92.)
      (2)   Use of motor vehicles; reimbursement for mileage.

following additional specific events:
            1.   No other means of City-owned transportation is or was

employee or official shall submit a comparison of the least costly mode of
transportation. Consideration shall be given to the travel time (lost work
generated by the employee or official), lodging, meals and the reimbursement
for mileage. When the automobile is the least costly mode of transportation,
the employee or official shall use a City vehicle. If a City vehicle is not
available and the employee or official is required to use his or her privately-
owned vehicle, the employee or official shall be reimbursed at the then-
applicable and current Federal per mile mileage reimbursement rate, as the same
may be amended from time to time, for travel mileage incurred in the direct
conduct of City business. The mileage reimbursement provided for herein
represents the total reimbursement to be made for all vehicle-related expenses
(e.g. gas, oil, depreciation, etc.). The mileage reimbursement is payable only

same vehicle. Employees or officials are expected to "car pool" if possible.

whenever possible, be paid in advance by the City upon presentation of an
invoice, notice or registration form.
            The cost of books, materials and other information offered for sale

classes established in division (b) of this section and shall be "picked up"
(assumed and paid to PFDPF) by the City.  This pick-up by the City constitutes,
and shall be designated as, employee contributions and shall be in lieu of
contributions to PFDPF by each person within any of the classes established in
division (b) of this section.  No person subject to such pick-up shall have the
option of choosing to receive the statutorily required contribution to PFDPF
directly instead of having it picked up by the City, or of being excluded from
the pick-up.
   The City shall, in reporting and making remittance to PFDPF, report that the
public employee's contribution for each person subject to such pick-up has been
made as provided by statute.
   (b)   The pick-up by the City provided by this section shall apply to all
persons who are employees of the City and who are or who become contributing
members of PFDPF.
   (c)   The City's method of payment of salary to employees who are
participants in PFDPF is hereby modified as provided for in division (d) of
this section in order to provide for a salary reduction pick-up of employee
contributions to PFDPF.
   (d)   The total salary for each employee shall be the salary otherwise
payable under the City's policies.  Such total salary of each employee shall be
payable by the City in two parts: deferred salary and cash salary.  An
employee's deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage of the employee's
total salary which is required, from time to time, by PFDPF to be paid as an
employee contribution by such employee, and shall be paid by the City to PFDPF
on behalf of such employee as a pick-up and in lieu of the PFDPF employee
contribution otherwise payable by such employee.  An employee's cash salary
shall be equal to such employee's total salary less the amount of the pick-up
for such employee, and shall be payable, subject to applicable payroll
deductions, to such employee.  The City shall compute and remit its employer
contributions to PFDPF based upon an employee's total salary.  The total
combined expenditures of the City for employees' total salaries, payable under
applicable City policies and the pick-up provisions of this section, shall not
be greater than the amounts it would have paid for those items had this section
not been in effect.
   (e)   The City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to implement the
provisions of this section to institute the pick-up of the statutorily required
contributions to PFDPF for those persons provided for in division (b) of this
section so as to enable them to obtain the result in Federal and State tax
deferments and other benefits.

252.32   AMENDMENT OF PERSONNEL POLICY MANUAL APPENDICES.

another, are hereby vested with the authority to amend the Personnel Policy
Manual appendices without express Council approval, in furtherance of the
objectives of the Personnel Policy Manual.

   (EDITOR’S NOTE:  Section 252.33 was repealed by Ordinance 11-75, passed July
29, 2011.)
252.34   CONVERSION OF VACATION AND COMPENSATORY TIME.
   The following method shall be used to calculate the conversion of
accumulated and unused vacation leave and compensatory time leave upon an
employee's transfer from a 53-hour work week position to that of a 40-hour or
37.5-hour work week position:
   (a)   A "conversion factor" shall be determined by way of a ratio where the
numerator of such ratio shall be the amount of vacation leave to which the
affected employee would be entitled to receive based upon the employee's
longevity as a 40-hour work week employee; and the denominator of such ratio
being the amount of vacation leave to which the affected employee would be
entitled to receive based upon the employee's longevity as a 53-hour work week
employee.
   (b)   Upon determination of such conversion factor, that factor shall be
multiplied with the affected employee's balance of vacation leave and/or
compensatory time leave as earned at the 53-hour work week rate, as such
balance existed at the time of the employee's transfer/promotion.
(Ord. 01-149.  Passed 10-16-01.)
252.35  MANDATORY TIME-OFF.
   (a)   As the result of inclement weather, disaster or other justifiable
cause, the Mayor is authorized and empowered to declare periods of mandatory
time-off for non-essential personnel employed by the City.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
      (1)   “Essential employees” shall be those employees declared by their
appointing authorities, on a case-by-case basis, whose attendance and efforts
are deemed by such appointing authorities to be necessary to ensure the orderly
continuation of basic services to the residents of the City, during those
periods of mandatory time-off declared by the Mayor.
      (2)   “Non-essential employees” shall be all other City employees who are
not designated as essential employees by their appointing authorities, during
those periods of mandatory time-off, declared by the Mayor.
   (c)   Compensation for non-essential employees affected by the Mayor's
declaration of periods of mandatory time-off shall be paid through the use of
an affected non-essential employee's accrued leave, including, but not limited
to sick leave, vacation leave, compensatory time and personal leave, at the
affected employee's designation and election.
   (d)   The following additional procedures shall be followed in connection
with the Mayor's declaration of periods of mandatory time-off:
      (1)   If a level 3 emergency is declared by the Darke County Sheriff
before 7:00 a.m. of the workday, and it is not a modified level 3 emergency, as
declared by the Mayor, all non-essential employees shall not report to work,
and the use of leave, as specified in division (c) above, shall be followed.
      (2)   If a declared level 3 emergency is lowered to a level 1 or level 2
emergency at, or before, 11:00 a.m. on the same workday, all affected non-
essential employees shall report to their workstations by 12:00 noon on such
workday. It shall be the duty of each affected non-essential employee to
confirm such return-to-work status with such affected employee's supervisor. If
an affected non-essential employee is of the opinion that he or she cannot
report to work due to weather conditions other than a declared level 3
emergency, the affected employee may use his or her vacation, compensatory, or
personal leave only.
      (3)   If a declared level 3 emergency is lowered to a level 1 or level 2
emergency after 11:00 a.m. on the same workday, non-essential employees are not
required to return to their workstations and may continue to use leave as
specified in division (c) above.
      (4)   If the City receives notification that a level 3 emergency is about
to be declared during the workday, nonessential employees shall be duly
advised. At the discretion of such affected non-essential employee's appointing
authority, such employee may be dismissed from further job responsibility on
such workday, and, thereupon, an affected non-essential employee may use his or
her leave, as specified in division (c) above.
      (5)   It shall be each affected non-essential employee's personal
responsibility to monitor the status of emergency level declarations and
amendments thereto, so as to ascertain his or her duly to report to his or her
workstation.

support among employees within the representation unit. Proceedings under this
section shall not be instituted sooner than one year following certification of
an employee organization, nor shall there be more than one election under this
section in the same unit in any twelvemonth period. The provisions of
subsections (b), (c) and (d) hereof shall apply to a proceeding under this
section. The Director of Public Service or the Director of Public Safety shall
cause a secret election to be conducted or supervised by an agency independent
of the City wherein the employees within the representation unit on the payroll

more than $100 as follows:
         A.   1.   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer
issues an offender a ticket, citation, or summons for a violation of any of the
aforementioned sections of the Ohio Revised Code, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a

of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the

offender’s payment in full and such written evidence.
         B.   1.   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty
for the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (b)(2)A. of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.  Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence
districts, the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. 
Where two or more through highways designated under this division intersect and
no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic- control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the

sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn

the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.

which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow.  A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering it, and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
      (2)   Flashing Yellow Caution Signal. Operators of vehicles may proceed
through the intersection or past the signal only with caution.
   (b)   This section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62, or substantially equivalent municipal

   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic” have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant.  This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.  If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense.  The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.

the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,

information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any

person.  The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician- paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section.  The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definition.  For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device.” Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section.  The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness.  Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(c),
(G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required.  Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. 
The person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request
of the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.,
O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under
State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest
for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face
increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the
Ohio or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the
person and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is
to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,  the person submits to the test
or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.

driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person.  Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance.  If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to §
698.02(f) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic
loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate

operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s

responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under division
(c)(3)C. of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court, neither the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept any

vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.

violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section. The
person charged with a violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of

         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)
(1) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth

valid permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator

a term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying
case. If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any
violation of this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has

of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially

loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate

   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(c) or (d) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law
enforcement officer's view of the interior or visual inspection of a motor
vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not be used for the purpose

State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in
this State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who
otherwise would be required to be restrained under this section has a physical
impairment that makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat or an
occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   (1)   Whoever violates division (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section
shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a
motor vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system,
booster seat or occupant restraining device as required by this section that
occurred at the same time, on the same day and at the same location is deemed
to be a single violation of this section:

section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars

division (b)(3) of this section is wearing all of the available elements of a
properly adjusted occupant restraining device.

      (4)   Operate a taxicab on any street or highway unless all factory-
equipped occupant restraining devices in the taxicab are maintained in usable
form.
   (c)   Exceptions.  Division (b)(3) of this section does not apply to a
person who is required by Ohio R.C. 4511.81 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance to be secured in a child restraint device or booster seat. 
Division (b)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is an employee
of the United States Postal Service or of a newspaper home delivery service,

   (d)   Officers Not Permitted to Stop Cars to Determine Violation. 
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law enforcement
officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on any street
or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of determining whether a
violation of division (b) of this section has been or is being committed or for
the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or summons for the violation or
for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for the
violation.  No law enforcement officer shall view the interior or visually

      (1)   Subject to division (f)(2) of this section, the failure of a person
to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section or
the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
         (Adopting Ordinance)
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject
to the penalty set forth in Section 408.02.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
         (Adopting Ordinance)
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

of improper replacement of a motor vehicle air bag, a misdemeanor of the first
degree on a first offense. On each subsequent offense, or if the violation
results in serious physical harm to an individual, the person is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (c) of this section is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (3)   Each manufacture, importation, installation, reinstallation, sale,
or offer for sale in violation of this section shall constitute a separate and
distinct violation.

   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The Municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
Ohio R.C. 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the State highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality.  No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the State highway
system.  The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the Municipality.  Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued.  The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section.  If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure.  In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit.  No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Streets.  No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity

section, and the search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice
was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or
lienholder shall pay to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within

substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police,
without charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county
in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with
the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the
Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Sheriff or Chief of Police. If the
vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other
facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police shall execute in triplicate
an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and that all
requirements of this section have been complied with. The Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or
other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor
vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue to such owner a salvage certificate of title, free
and clear of all liens and encumbrances.

to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is

purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the

vehicles from the streets designated and to remove all motor vehicles parked in
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. While the City will make
every effort to inform the public of the existence of weather conditions
requiring removal of parked motor vehicles from the streets designated herein,
the owners and operators of motor vehicles parked in these areas shall have

parked motor vehicles if the weather conditions are such as to require their
removal under this chapter.

606.02   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

   (b)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (a)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes

Municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this Municipality.
   (c)   (1)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.

   (f)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (g)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.

commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined to
match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,

on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever

   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

(ORC 2901.13)
606.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Culpability."  Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   "Intoxication."  Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   "Involuntary acts."  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   "Possession."  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial

offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.

   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.

an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.

defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).

address of the person aggrieved; the name and address of the person against
whom the complaint is filed; a description and the address of the dwelling or
business involved in the alleged discriminatory housing practice or employment
practice; a concise statement of the facts, including pertinent dates,
constituting the alleged discriminatory housing or employment practice; and
such other information as may be required by the Board. The complaint may be
reasonably and fairly amended. The Board may also corroborate or initiate
complaints on the basis of studies carried out by its staff or by volunteers
authorized by the Board.
   (b)   Upon the filing of the complaint, the Secretary of the Board shall
make such investigation as he or she deems appropriate to ascertain facts and
issues. Such investigation shall be conducted within 14 business days after the
filing of the complaint. The investigation may be extended when deemed
necessary by the Chairperson of the Board. If the Secretary determines that
there are reasonable grounds to believe that a violation has occurred, he or
she shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial conference and
persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives as the parties
may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be informal and
nothing said or done during such initial conferences shall be made public by
any member of the Board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto in
writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes and does not constitute an
admission by any parties that the law has been violated. The consent agreement
shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its Chairperson.
   (d)   The Board is hereby authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the
Ohio Real Estate Commission, the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, or any other person or group
regarding any matters before the Board.
   (e)   If the Secretary of the Board determines that the complaint lacks
reasonable grounds upon which to base a violation of any of the provisions of
this chapter, he or she shall so inform the Board and the Board may, in its
discretion, dismiss such complaint or order such further investigation as may
be necessary. However, the Board shall not dismiss such complaint without first
affording either party an opportunity to appear before the Board.
   (f)   If the Secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, or fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or an informal consent agreement, or determines that a complaint is
not susceptible to conciliation, he or she shall so notify the Board and the
Board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether or not a
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter has been committed. The
Board shall serve upon the respondent a written statement of charges and a
summons and shall serve upon all interested parties a notice of the time and
place of the hearing. The respondent or his or her authorized counsel may file
and amend such statements with the Board prior to the hearing date as he or she
deems necessary in support of his or her position. The hearing shall be open to
the public. The hearing shall be held not less than 15 calendar days nor more
than 30 calendar days after service of the statement of charges and summons.
The summons so issued must be signed by two members of the Board and the
issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of named persons and the
production of relevant documents and records. Failure to comply with a summons
shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The interested parties may, at
their option, appear before the Board in person or by a duly authorized
representative and may have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may
present testimony in evidence, and the right to cross-examine witnesses shall
be preserved. All testimony in evidence shall be given under oath or by
affirmation. The Secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing, which
record shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon request
by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such party a
copy of the hearing record at such cost as the Board deems appropriate.
   (g)   If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines upon the
preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has violated
any of the provisions of this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with
the Law Director in executive session, state its finding to and call the
Director to prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the
person complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to
take such affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose of this chapter,
with notice that if the Board, upon investigation by the Secretary, determines
that the person complained against has not, after 15 calendar days following
service of the Board's order, complied with the order, the Board will recertify
the matter to the Director for enforcement. The Director shall seek compliance
by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Board before a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   (h)   If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not violated any of the provisions of this chapter, the Board shall so
state and publish its findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

fire authority having jurisdiction shall designate the no smoking area.  In
places included in division (a)(2) of this section that are owned by the State

authority shall designate an officer who shall designate the area.  In places
included in division (a)(3) of this section, the person having control of the

designate the area in places in division (a)(2) of this section shall designate
the no smoking area.  A no smoking area may include the entire place of public
assembly.  Designations shall be made by the placement of signs that are
clearly visible and that state "no smoking."  No person shall remove signs from
areas designated as no smoking areas.

bank thereof where the same is likely to either pollute the watercourse or be
washed into the water either by ordinary flow or annual floods. This section
does not apply to any substance placed under authority of a permit issued
pursuant to State law or to those exempted by Ohio R.C. 611.04, and no owner or
occupant of the aforementioned watercourses or wells shall knowingly permit
such substance to remain therein or thereon to the annoyance of any resident,
or refuse or neglect to remove or abate the nuisance occasioned thereby within
24 hours after knowledge of the existence thereof, notice thereof from an
authorized law enforcement officer, or warning thereof by the Police
Department.

698.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Dangerous offender" means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   "Repeat offender" means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section 698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C.
2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) or (b)(6) of this section and unless
another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the sentencing court
imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects or is required to
impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this chapter, the court shall
impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section.  The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C.  307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the
conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a

misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term of up to 60 days in a community alternative sentencing center
or district community alternative sentencing center established and operated in
accordance with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section,
with one of the conditions of the sanction being that the offender complete in
the center the entire term imposed.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)C. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.

ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.

(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim's economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. The court may base the
amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the
offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating
the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other information, provided
that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the court holds an
evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from
the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two

following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.

incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider

division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. 
A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(ORC 2929.28)
698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section 698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Section 698.02 of this Code or
Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a sentence upon an offender
for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any sanction or combination of
sanctions under Section 698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence
that imposes an unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section 698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section 698.02(c), (d), (e),
and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04   ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05   MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(E), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (C), a prison term, jail term, or  sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States.  Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131.  When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19 or a substantially
similar municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a prison term
that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06, 2903.07, 2903.08
or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04 involving the operation
of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a State correctional
institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and
prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies
under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive
terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony
before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

698.06   MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE (REPEALED).
   (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Section 698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating

698.07   SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially similar.

806.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Alarm system" means any mechanical or electrical device that is
arranged, designed or used to signal the occurrence in the City of a burglary,
robbery, other criminal offense, fire emergency or medical emergency requiring
urgent attention, and to which police, fire or emergency medical personnel are
expected to respond. "Alarm system" includes a system through which public
safety personnel are notified directly of such signals through automatic
recording devices or notified indirectly by way of third persons who monitor
the alarm systems and who report such signals to the Department of Public
Safety. "Alarm system" also includes a system designed to register a signal
which is so audible or visible, or in other way perceptible, outside a
protected building, structure or facility, as to notify persons in the
neighborhood beyond the zoning lot where the signal is located, who may in turn
notify the Department of the signal. "Alarm system" does not include a system
affixed to an automobile.
   (b)   "Alarm user" means any person, firm, corporation, association,
partnership or other entity who or which purchases, leases, contracts for or
obtains an alarm system.
   (c)   "Alarm user registration" means registration with the City to allow
the operation of an alarm system within the City.
   (d)   "False alarm" means a signal emitted by an alarm system indicating
that an emergency response is needed by public safety personnel at the location
of the alarm when, in fact, no such emergency condition exists. "False alarm"
does not include alarm signals caused by violent conditions of nature or false
alarms that would be subject to prosecution.
   (e)   "Public safety personnel" means any member of the Police Department or
the Fire Department or emergency medical personnel.
   (Ord. 96-107.  Passed 7-16-96.)
806.02   ALARM USER REGISTRATIONS.
   (a)   No person shall operate, or permit on premises under his or her
control the operation of, an alarm system, unless such person first registers
such alarm system with the Police Department. Such registrations shall be
completed without fee.
   (b)   If an alarm user has more than one alarm system protecting two or more
separate structures having different addresses, a separate registration shall
be required for each system.
   (c)   Applications for alarm user registration shall be made on forms
provided by the Police Department. The application shall include the name,
address and telephone number of the applicant and the name, address and
telephone number of the property to be serviced by the alarm.
   (d)   Each application to register an alarm system which pertains to a
residence shall provide the name and telephone number of at least one other
person to be contacted in case of an emergency when the user is unavailable.
Each application to register an alarm system which pertains to a building,
structure or facility, other than a residence, shall provide at least three
such names, unless such facility employs fewer than three persons. An alarm
monitoring company name may be substituted for the required names if a
contractual arrangement exists between the user and the monitoring company.
   (e)   Each holder of an alarm user registration shall, within ten days of
any change in the information of the registration application, notify the
Police Department, in writing, of any such change.
   (f)   The Department shall mail to each registration holder a notice of
expiration not less than thirty days before the expiration of the registration.
This notice shall be sent to the service address provided on the registration
application and shall include a form on which renewal may be requested.
   (g)   Renewal of such registration shall be accomplished by signing the
request for renewal and returning it to the Department prior to the expiration
of the registration. The signature shall certify the accuracy of the
information currently on file regarding the registration, or may correct and
update such information, and shall be the signature of the alarm system user or
any person listed on the application currently on file.
   Changes in information given on the application for renewal which were not
previously reported at the time of any such change and which had not been
ascertained by the Department prior to the time of renewal shall not be subject
to any action under Section 806.99.
   (h)   All alarm user registrations shall be valid for two years from the
date of issuance.
   (i)   No alarm user registration shall be transferred, assigned or used by
any person other than the alarm user to whom such registration was issued.
   (j)   Failure to comply with any of the provisions of this section shall
subject the alarm user to the penalties set forth in Section 806.99, and may,
in addition, be cause for denying the issuance of an alarm user registration or
for revocation of an existing registration. (Ord. 96-107.  Passed 7-16-96.)
806.03   EXCESSIVE FALSE ALARMS.
   (a)   The Police Department shall monitor the number of false alarms to
which public safety personnel respond, keeping records of the same. Such
records shall indicate the date of each such false alarm, the name and address
of the user of the system generating the false alarm, the time of the false
alarm, the weather conditions existing at the time of the false alarm and such
additional information as deemed necessary by the Chief of Police.
   (b)   The Director of Public Safety and Service may require the subscriber
to comply with any one or a combination of the following requirements as would
minimize, in his or her judgment, such false alarms in the future:
      (1)   If, during a calendar year, more than three false alarms are
produced by any alarm system, the Director or his or her designee may assess
against the relevant alarm user a charge of not less than twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for each false alarm in excess of three and up to and including seven
false alarms. Such assessment shall be satisfied within thirty days from the
date of notice.
      (2)   If, during a calendar year, more than seven false alarms are
produced by any alarm system, the Director or his or her designee may assess
against the relevant alarm user a charge of not less than one hundred dollars
($100.00) for each false alarm in excess of seven. Such assessment shall be
satisfied within thirty days from the date of notice.
      (3)   If, during a calendar year, more than eleven false alarms are
produced by any alarm system, the Director or his or her designee may require
the alarm user to disconnect the alarm system in such a fashion that alarm
signals are not emitted, either directly or indirectly. Such disconnect order
shall remain in effect until such time as the alarm user has presented such
documentation as, in the opinion of the Director or his or her designee,
suffices to indicate that the cause of the false alarms generated by the alarm
system has been repaired or otherwise remedied.
         No person shall fail to comply with any such order of the Director or
his or her designee. (Ord. 96-107.  Passed 7-16-96.)
806.04   NONLIABILITY OF CITY.
   Nothing in this chapter, nor the existence of any other fact, shall be
construed to require a response, by public safety personnel operated by or in
conjunction with the City, to any address or location registering an alarm
through the use of an alarm system. The City neither assumes nor bears any
liability for any failure to respond to any such alarm signal.
(Ord. 96-107.  Passed 7-16-96.)
806.99   PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of
Section 806.02 is guilty of a minor misdemeanor for a first offense and shall
be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00). For any subsequent
offense, such person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree and shall
be fined not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) or imprisoned not
more than thirty days, or both.
   (b)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of
Section 806.03 is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree for a first
offense and shall be fined not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) or
imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both. For any subsequent offense, such
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree and shall be fined not
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned not more than sixty
days, or both.

   Upon notice in writing being given to the Police Department that any person
is the owner of electrical equipment, the use or operation of which interferes
with the reception of radio receiving sets in the City, the Police Department
shall investigate the cause of such electrical interference and report its
findings to the Director of Public Safety. The Director, upon receipt of the
report, shall, if in his opinion conditions so warrant, order the Police
Department to notify the owner, operator or user of such electrical apparatus
to immediately repair or suspend from use such appliance until the same has
been altered or repaired so that electrical interference no longer exists. In
the event that any electrical appliance interferes in any way with the
reception of any radio receiving or sending set of the Police Department, the
Police Department is authorized and directed to order the owner, operator or
user of such electrical appliance to cease its operation until repairs or
alterations are made so as to eliminate such interference. For this purpose the
Police Department shall have the right to enter into any building in the City
to remedy such condition. In the event that the owner, user or operator of such
electrical appliance does not cooperate, the Police Department shall disconnect
such electrical appliance so that the same cannot be operated. Such action
shall be in addition to the penalty provided in Section 824. 99. No person
shall refuse to comply with any notice or order of the Police Department issued
pursuant to this section and no person shall refuse to grant any member of the
Police Department access to any building or part thereof for the purpose of
remedying conditions that are in violation of this section.

   As used in this chapter "going-out-of-business sale" means any sale of
goods, wares or merchandise at retail represented to the public in such a
manner that the public may conclude that the person conducting such sale will
not continue in the same business after all of the goods, wares or merchandise
offered for sale have been sold.
(Ord. 62-66. Passed 12-18-62.)
832.02   EXCEPTIONS.
   This chapter shall not apply to public or court officers or to any person
acting under the direction of State or Federal courts in the course of his
official duties.
(Ord. 62-66. Passed 12-18-62.)
832.03   LICENSE REQUIRED.
   No person shall conduct in the City any sale of goods, wares or merchandise
at retail which is represented to the public as a going-out-of-business sale of
a bankrupt, assignee, adjuster, trustee, executor, administrator, receiver or
liquidator or a sale of any distress stock or any other sale which by
representation may lead the public to believe it is a going-out-of-business
sale, without first filing with the City Auditor the inventory provided for in
Section 832.04 and obtaining from the City Auditor a license therefor, such
license to be known as a going-out-of-business sale license.
(Ord. 62-66. Passed 12-18-62.)
832.04   LICENSE APPLICATION; INVENTORY REQUIRED.
   Any person desiring to obtain a going-out-of-business sale license shall
make application therefor to the City Auditor. The application shall state the
name and address of the applicant and shall specify the period of time during
which the sale will continue, which time shall not exceed three months, except
as provided in Section 832.07. The application shall have attached thereto an
inventory which shall contain:
   (a)   A listing of all goods which have been in stock for a period of
fifteen days or longer prior to the application for the license, together with
the wholesale price thereof;
   (b)   A listing of all goods received in stock within fifteen days
immediately preceding the application for the license, together with the
wholesale price thereof; and
   (c)   A listing of all goods which have been ordered and will be placed in
stock during the pendency of the sale, together with the wholesale price
thereof.
   The application shall provide the method by which the applicant for the
license acquired title to such goods and the reason for the urgent and
expeditious disposal thereof. The inventory or listing shall be signed by the
person seeking the license and shall be accompanied by the oath of the
applicant that the statements contained in the application are true and
correct. A true copy of such inventory, from which the wholesale price may be
omitted, shall be posted by the licensee in a conspicuous place on the premises
in which such goods are being sold, offered for sale or displayed and shall be
open to public inspection during the period for which a license has been
granted.
(Ord. 62-66. Passed 12-18-62.)
832.05   BOND REQUIRED.
   Any person desiring to conduct a going-out-of-business sale shall, before
engaging in such sale, file with the City Auditor an application as required,
which application shall be accompanied by a bond in the amount of ten thousand
dollars ($10,000), or ten percent of the wholesale value of the inventory
submitted by such applicant pursuant to Section 832.04, whichever amount is
greater, said bond to be executed by a surety company or by two responsible
freeholders residing in the City, or, in lieu thereof, a cash bond of equal
amount, conditioned upon all goods being sold as represented. Any person having
a grievance due to the action of any person conducting a going-out-of-business
sale shall have a right of action on the bond for the recovery of money or
damages or both. In the event a cash bond is deposited, such deposit shall be
retained by the City for a period of ninety days after the expiration of the
going-out-of-business sale. The City Auditor shall not issue a license for a
going-out-of-business sale until the bond provided for in this section has been
filed and approved.
(Ord. 93-171. Passed 10-5-93.)
832.06   LICENSE FEE.

fifty dollars ($250.00), payable in advance.
(Ord. 93-171. Passed 10-5-93.)
832.07   LICENSE RENEWAL AND FEE.
   If, at any time during the three-month period set forth in Section 832.04,
an application is filed with the City Auditor, making it appear that all the
goods in the original inventory have not been sold, accompanied by an inventory
of what remains, showing the wholesale purchase price and the date of purchase,
one supplemental license for a period not to exceed thirty days may be issued
by the City Auditor if, in the opinion of said City Auditor, the applicant has
complied with the requirements of the original license and has paid an
additional license fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). Such license
shall continue in effect only as long as such license fee is paid and the
licensee complies with the provisions of this chapter. Any application for a
license under the provisions of this chapter covering any goods, wares or
merchandise previously inventoried and licensed shall be deemed to be an
application for a renewal under this section, whether presented by the original
applicant or by any other person.
(Ord. 93-171. Passed 10-5-93.)
832.08   ADDING GOODS PROHIBITED.

chapter shall add any goods to the inventoried stock, and no goods shall be
sold except those which are included in the original inventory. Each sale of
goods not so inventoried shall constitute a separate offense.
(Ord. 62-66. Passed 12-18-62.)

thereon that the persons whose signatures are affixed thereto do thereby give
their assent to the drilling of the well for oil or gas.  However, if the
proposed site for a well is located a distance of 300 feet or  more from any
abutting property the assenting signatures herein provided for shall not be
required.  Measurement for determining the distance of 300 feet shall be made
from the exact location where it is contemplated that the well shall be

(Ord. 64-40.  Passed 6-14-64.)
844.04   INVESTIGATION AND REPORT.
   The special committee provided for in Section 844.02 shall investigate the

844.06   INVESTIGATION; PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION.
   The Director of Public Service shall refer each application for a permit to
the special investigating committee provided for in Section 844.02, which shall
investigate the premises for which such permit is sought.  When such
investigation is completed, the application, together with a written report of
the investigation, shall be submitted to the Planning Commission, which shall
recommend the granting thereof if it finds from the investigation and
application that such application complies in all respects with the provisions
of this chapter; otherwise, the Commission shall recommend the rejection of
such application. 
(Ord. 64-40.  Passed 6-16-64.)
844.07   ISSUANCE OF PERMIT; BOND REQUIRED.
   The Director of Public Service shall issue the permit applied for upon
receipt of the application duly approved by the Planning Commission and upon
the furnishing of a bond by the applicant of one hundred thousand dollars
($100, 000) in a form and with a surety approved by the Mayor and the City
Solicitor, conditioned upon the faithful observance of all laws relating to
drilling oil and gas wells. The bond shall be further conditioned upon the
permittee's or his assigns' restoration of any street, sidewalk or other public
place of the City which may be disturbed in the operation to its former
condition; clearing the area of all litter, machinery, derricks, buildings, oil
and other substances used or allowed in the drilling or producing operation,
whenever the well is abandoned or the operation discontinued; and paying to the
owners of any buildings, improvements, goods or chattels located in the area
any extra cost of insurance on such property imposed by reason of the granting
of the permit and any and all damages suffered by any person, as to property in
the City, from fire, over and above the insurance collected thereon, or from
oil, gas or water caused by or originating from the operation connected with
such well; and holding the City free and harmless from any and all liability
growing out of the granting of such permit.
(Ord. 64-40. Passed 6-16-64.)
844.08   LIMITATION ON ISSUANCE OF PERMIT.
   No permit shall be issued for the drilling of a well except upon ground
owned by the applicant or held by the applicant under an oil and gas lease or
drilling contract from the owner, giving the owner's permission to drill the
well. Nothing herein contained, nor any permit issued hereunder, shall be
deemed to grant any right or license to the permittee to enter upon or occupy
in any respect in the drilling or production operations, any land, except by
the written permission of the owner. When a permit has been issued, the same
shall terminate and become inoperative, without any action on the part of the
City, if drilling of the well is not begun within sixty days from the date of
issuance of the permit. After the drilling of a well has commenced, the
cessation for a like period of the drilling operations shall operate to
terminate and cancel the permit and the well shall be deemed abandoned for all
purposes of this chapter. No person shall thereafter drill or operate any such
well without the issuance of another permit.
(Ord. 64-40. Passed 6-16-64.)
844.09   OPERATION UNDER PERMIT; DRILLING DISTANCES.
   No person shall erect or use within the corporate limits, within 300 feet of

any drilling rig, and every such drilling plant shall be equipped with a fire
extinguisher maintained in good condition. No person shall drill an oil or gas
well or extend or deepen one already drilled within seventy-five feet of any
public street in the City. Measurements for such distance shall be made from
the contour of the well. The Director of Public Service shall make a weekly
inspection of operations and shall report his findings to the Director of
Public Safety.
(Ord. 64-40. Passed 6-16-64.)
844.10   REJECTION OF APPLICATION.
   Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this chapter, the Planning
Commission shall have the right to recommend rejection of any application for a
permit when, by reason of the location of the proposed well, the character and
value of the permanent improvements already erected, the use to which the land
and surroundings are adapted for civic purposes or for sanitary reasons, the
drilling of an oil or gas well will constitute a serious disadvantage, nuisance
or hazard to the City or any of its inhabitants. When a permit is rejected, the
cash deposit required to be made with the application shall be returned to the
applicant. Appeal from a decision of the Planning Commission to deny a permit
to the applicant under the provisions of this section shall be to Council,
which may reverse such decision by a three-fourths vote of its members.
(Ord. 64-40. Passed 6-16-64.)
844.11   DURATION AND RELEASE OF BOND.
   The bond provided for in Section 844.07 shall be in full force and effect
during the entire drilling operation and until such time as the well is capped
and for at least thirty days thereafter. At that time or at any time
thereafter, to which date the bond shall continue in full force and effect, the
applicant may present his certificate of insurance to the Director of Public
Service and make written request that the bond provided be released and that in
lieu thereof the certificate of insurance be filed with the Director. The
insurance policy represented by the certificate of insurance shall cover the
applicant's liability for property damage in an amount not less than one
hundred thousand dollars ($100, 000), and the applicant's liability for
personal injury in an amount not less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,
000), which insurance policy must be maintained for such period of time as the
well is in operation or is producing oil or gas or is properly plugged and
abandoned. When the written request for release of the applicant's bond is
made, the Director shall make or cause to be made an examination of the
premises for which the bond is provided and if such examination discloses that
the applicant has complied with the terms of the bond the Director shall notify
the Mayor who, with the approval of the City Solicitor, shall execute a release
of the principal and surety. Thereafter the bond shall not be in effect and the
principal and surety thereon shall be released from all future liability on
such bond.
(Ord. 64-40. Passed 6-16-64.)
844.12   MAP OR BLUEPRINT REQUIRED.
   It shall be the duty of any person owning or leasing property for the
purpose of drilling for oil or gas thereon to provide a map or blueprint at the
time of making the application, showing the exact location where the proposed
well is to be drilled. In the event that a permit should be granted, the map or
blueprint shall remain on file in the office of the City Engineer for future
reference.
(Ord. 64-40. Passed 6-16-64.)
844.13   CONTROL GATE, CASING STIPULATION AND DRILLING.
   (a)   It shall be the duty of any person in the drilling of a well to
provide for a drilling control gate, which shall be so constructed as to
effectively cut off the flow of gas at the top of the well and which can be
operated at a point remote from the well.
   (b)   In any event all casing which is inserted into a gas or oil well shall
be so constructed as to withstand pressure of at least 2, 000 pounds per square
inch.
   (c)   The annular space between the casing and well wall shall be filled
from below the Big Injun sand to the surface with prepared clay, cement, rock
sediment or bentonite to prevent any migration of water. If bentonite is used,
the mixture shall be not less than two parts bentonite and one part ground fire
clay and shall be circulated under pressure to the top of the hole.
   (d)   The mixture provided for in subsection (c) hereof shall apply in the
mudding of the Berea grit casing.
(Ord. 64-40. Passed 6-16-64.)
844.14   ABANDONMENT OF WELL.
   In the event that a well is abandoned, it shall be the duty of the owner or
lessee to notify the Director of Public Service who shall then advise the City
Engineer of such abandonment, and the same shall be indicated on the map
provided at the time of the original application.
(Ord. 64-40. Passed 6-16-64.)
844.15   SEALING OF WELLS.
   It shall be the duty of the applicant to seal gas and oil wells to protect
fresh water wells from salt water pollution. To that end the applicant shall
notify the State Division of Mines of his intention to plug or abandon a well
and the mudding and plugging shall be done under the supervision of a
representative of the State Division of Mines, in one of the following methods:
   (a)   The Casing Method consists of setting a string of casing between the
potable water (Injun) and the sale water (Berea). This string of casing is to
remain in place during the life of the well, unless another approved method of
separation is used.
   (b)   The Casing Packer Method consists of setting a string of casing
through the sale water (Berea) with a packer between the potable water (Injun)
and the sale water (Berea). Prepared mud should be added on top of the packer
after completion. This string of casing is to remain in place during the life
of the well, unless some other approved method of separation is used.
   (c)   The Casing Bentonite-Clay Method consists of setting a string of
casing through the sale water (Berea) and filling outside the casing with
bentonite-clay by circulating under pressure, before further drilling is done.
This string of casing is to remain in place during the life of the well, unless
some other approved method of separation is used.
   (d)   If a well is found productive, the ten-inch casing set through the Big
Injun sand is withdrawn and replaced by an eight-inch string of casing with a
ten-inch Swage attached to the bottom. The annular space between the eight-inch
casing and the wall of the hole on top of ten-inch Swage shall be filled with
ground prepared Fire Clay to the surface.
   (e)   A bridge shall be set above the top water in the Big Lime and
sufficient fill made to support the setting of a lead plug between the top
water in the Big Lime and the top of the Big Lime. The hole immediately above
such lead plug shall be filled to 200 feet with prepared clay, rock sediment or
cement.
   (f)   The hole shall be filled from the top of the plug immediately above
the Berea sand to the surface with prepared clay, rock sediment or cement.
(Ord. 64-40. Passed 6-16-64.)
844.16   HAULING OF EXPLOSIVES.
   Except as otherwise provided in the General Offenses Code, in the Fire
Prevention Code or elsewhere in these Codified ordinances, no person shall
haul, cart, carry or convey any explosives in any manner over the streets or
other public ways of the City without first obtaining a permit therefor from
the Director of Public Service. The Director is hereby authorized to establish
routes over which such explosives may be conveyed. The person in charge of the
operation of the conveyance of explosives shall carry with him at all times,
while in the act of conveyance, the permit issued for such purpose, which
permit shall set forth the route and destination of the explosives.
(Ord. 64-40. Passed 6-16-64.)
844.17   HOURS FOR DRILLING.

888.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter shall be to levy a tax on transactions by which
lodging is to be furnished to transient guests within the corporate limits of
the City.
(Ord. 02-117.  Passed 10-15-02.)
888.02   DEFINITIONS.
   When used in this chapter and unless otherwise distinctly expressed, the
following words and phrases shall have the meanings set out herein:
   (a)   "Auditor" means the Auditor of the City of Greenville, Ohio.
   (b)   "Hotel" or "motel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained,
advertised or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered for a consideration to guests, in which one or more
rooms are used for the accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in
one or several structures.
   (c)   "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms, or space or portion thereof, to any hotel or
motel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or
right to use or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office
space, banquet or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space
shall not be considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless
the person exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or
possess all or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging
or sleeping purposes.
   (d)   "Operator" means the person who is the proprietor of the hotel or
motel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, licensee, mortgagee in
possession, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions
through a managing agent of any type or character, rather than an employee, the
managing agent shall be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and
shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with
the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent
shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   (e)   "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (f)   "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in money,
whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits
and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for which
the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (g)   "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than 30 consecutive days.
(Ord. 02-117.  Passed 10-15-02.)
888.03   RATE OF TAX.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the City for the use of the general fund of the City, there is hereby levied a
tax of three percent on all rents received by a hotel or motel for lodging
furnished to transient guests.
   (b)   Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the City,
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City,
or to the City.
   (c)   The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel or
motel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guest ceasing to occupy space in the hotel
or motel. If, for any reason, the tax due is not paid to the operator of the
hotel or motel, the Auditor may require that such tax shall be paid directly to
the Auditor.
(Ord. 02-117.  Passed 10-15-02.)
888.04   EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   No tax shall be imposed under this chapter:
      (1)   Upon rents not within the taxing power of the City under the
Constitution or laws of Ohio or the United States; or
      (2)   Upon rents paid by the State of Ohio or any of its political
subdivisions.
   (b)   No exemption claimed under divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section
shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is
collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the Auditor.
All claims of exemption shall be made in the manner prescribed by the Auditor.
(Ord. 02-117.  Passed 10-15-02.)
888.05   TAX-EXEMPT STATUS FALSIFIED.
   (a)   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as
required by this chapter, or present to the operator false evidence indicating
that the lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax.
   (b)   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest shall
furnish to the operator, and the operator shall obtain from the transient
guest, a certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject
to the tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax
applies.
(Ord. 02-117.  Passed 10-15-02.)
888.06   TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for such occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the City, and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (b)   No operator of a hotel or motel shall advertise or state in any
manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will
be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the
rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner
hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 02-117.  Passed 10-15-02.)
888.07   REGISTRATION.
   Within 30 days after the effective date of this chapter, or within 30 days
after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel or
motel renting lodging to transient guests shall register such hotel or motel
with the Auditor and obtain from him or her a "Transient Occupancy Registration
Certificate" to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.
Such certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
   (a)   The name of the operator;
   (b)   The address of the hotel or motel;
   (c)   The date upon which the certificate was issued; and
   (d)   That "this Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that
the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the
Hotel-Motel Tax Ordinance by registering with the Auditor of the City of
Greenville for the purpose of collecting from transient guests the hotel-motel
tax and remitting such tax to the Auditor. This certificate does not constitute
a permit."
(Ord. 02-117.  Passed 10-15-02.)
888.08   RECORDS; INSPECTION; DESTRUCTION.
   Each operator shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the
operator's records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale
was not exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction,
if exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be
opened during business hours to the inspection of the Auditor, and shall be
preserved for a period of four years, unless the Auditor, in writing, consents
to their destruction within that period, or by any orders requesting that such
records be kept for a longer period of time.
(Ord. 02-117.  Passed 10-15-02.)
888.09   REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   Each operator shall, on or before the tenth day of the month, for the
preceding month's business, or at the close of any longer reporting period
which may be established by the Auditor, make a return to the Auditor on forms
provided by him or her of the total rents charged and received and the amount
of tax collected by transient occupancies. All claims for exemption from tax
filed by occupants with the operator during the reporting period shall be filed
with the report. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax
collected shall be remitted to the Auditor. The Auditor may establish shorter
reporting periods for any certificate holder if he or she deems it necessary in
order to insure collection of the tax, and he or she may require further
information in the return, if such information is pertinent to the collection
of the tax. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business
for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall
be held in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to
the Auditor. All returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be
treated as confidential by the Auditor and shall not be released by him or her
except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or
agent of the United States, the State of Ohio, the County of Darke, or the City
for official use only.
(Ord. 02-117.  Passed 10-15-02.)
888.10   PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (a)   Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten
percent of the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)   Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittances on or before a period of 30 days following the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty equal
to ten  percent of the amount of the tax and previous penalty in addition to
the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed. An additional penalty equal
to ten percent of the total tax and penalty of the previous 30-day period shall
be added for each successive 30-day period that the account remains delinquent.
   (c)   Fraud.  If the Auditor determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to 25
percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the
penalties stated in divisions (a) and (b) of this section.
   (d)   Interest.
      (1)   In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator who
fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate
of one- half of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of
the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent until paid.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the imposition of the interest penalty referenced
in paragraph (d)(1) above, upon the joint recommendation of the City Auditor
and the City Law Director, for good cause shown, the collection of such
interest may be reduced in amount or waived in its entirety.
   (e)   Penalties During Pendency of Hearing or Appeal.  No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed ruling the pendency of any
hearing provided for herein, nor during the pendency of any appeal to the Board
of Tax Appeals provided for herein.
(Ord. 02-117.  Passed 10-15-02; Ord. 10-29.  Passed 5-4-10.)
888.11   FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF TAX BY AUDITOR.
   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect such tax and to make, within
the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Auditor shall proceed in such
manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to
base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Auditor shall procure
such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base
the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator
who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and
remittance, he or she shall proceed to determine and assess against such
operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case
such determination is made, the Auditor shall give a notice of the amount so
assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last
known place of business. Such operator may, within ten days after the serving
or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the Auditor for a
hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is
not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any,
determined by the Auditor shall become final and conclusive and immediately due
and payable. If such application is made, the Auditor shall give not less than
five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to
show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why such amount specified
therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such
hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax,
interest and penalties should not be fixed. After such hearing, the Auditor
shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written
notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and
the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due
shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section
888.12.
(Ord. 02-117.  Passed 10-15-02.)
888.12   APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Auditor with respect to the
amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the Board of
Tax Appeals by filing a notice of appeal with it within 15 days of the serving
or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Board shall fix a time and
place for hearing such appeal and shall give notice in writing to such operator
at his or her last known place of business. The findings of the Board shall be
final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner
prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due
shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 02-117.  Passed 10-15-02.)
888.13   ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the City.
Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the City shall
be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the City. Any person owing money to
the City under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action
brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 02-117.  Passed 10-15-02.)
888.14   REFUNDS.
   (a)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
divisions (b) and (c) of this section, provided a claim in writing therefor,
stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is
founded, is filed with the Auditor within three years of the date of payment.
The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Auditor.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Auditor that the person from whom the tax has been collected
was not a transient guest; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a
credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either
been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently payable
by the transient to the operator.
   (c)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by
filing of a claim in the manner provided in division (a) of this section, but
only when the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Auditor, or
when the transient guest having paid to the operator, establishes to the
satisfaction of the Auditor that the transient guest has been unable to obtain
a refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (d)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.
(Ord. 02-117.  Passed 10-15-02.)
888.15   MONEYS RECEIVED; WHERE CREDITED.
   The moneys received under the provisions of this chapter shall be credited
to the General Fund of the City.
(Ord. 02-117.  Passed 10-15-02.)
888.16   DISCRETION VESTED IN AUDITOR AND LAW DIRECTOR AS TO COLLECTION AND
ENFORCEMENT.
   The Auditor and Law Director of the City, working in concert with one
another, and upon their joint, unanimous determination, are vested with the
authority and discretion to waive enforcement of any of the provisions of this
chapter.
(Ord. 10-66.  Passed 9-21-10.)
888.99   PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or be imprisoned for a
period of not more than six months, or both.
   (b)   Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as
required herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or
refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the Auditor,
or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of a
misdemeanor, and is punishable as aforesaid. Any person required to make,
render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes a false or fraudulent
report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount
due required by this chapter to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is
punishable as aforesaid.

   (d)   (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Division (d) of this section was repealed by
Ordinance 93-172, passed November 2, 1993.)
   (e)   Public utilities and private contractors who or which reasonably
anticipate that each such utility or contractor shall be required to make more
than one street opening in a calendar year, may be relieved from the
responsibility of posting individual  maintenance guarantee bonds for each
street opening by doing the following:
      (1)   When, in the opinion of the Director of Public Safety and Service,
the cost of providing an individual guarantee bond for each street opening
would work an undue and unreasonable financial hardship to a private contractor
or public utility, the Director of Public Safety and Service may allow such
public utility or private contractor to post a single, annual maintenance
guarantee bond, or other suitable evidence of surety, as determined by the Law
Director, in lieu of an individual maintenance guarantee bond, said single,
annual guarantee to be in an amount as follows:
         A.   Public utilities: Forty thousand dollars ($40,000), which
guarantee shall constitute the required maintenance guarantee for not more than
20 surface restorations within a calendar year.
         B.   Private contractors:  Twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), which
guarantee shall constitute the required maintenance guarantee for not more than
ten surface restorations by each such private contractor within a 12-month
period.
      In the event that the actual number of surface restorations to be
performed by an individual public utility or private contractor exceeds the
aggregate annual limits of 20 for a public utility or ten for a private
contractor, the affected public utility or private contractor shall post an
individual maintenance guarantee bond, as provided herein, for each surface
restoration in excess of the applicable aggregate annual limit to be performed
during the balance of such year, or such public utility or private contractor
may post an additional annual maintenance guarantee bond in the amount set
forth in division (e)(1)A. and B. of this section, which additional one-year
maintenance guarantee bond shall, thereupon, constitute the required
maintenance guarantee for an additional amount of surface restorations for the
balance of the calendar year, as set forth in such divisions.
      No such maintenance guarantee bond or other surety required hereunder
shall be written so as to terminate sooner than 12 months after the date of the
completion of the final surface restoration anticipated by such maintenance
guarantee bond or other surety.
      In the event that the required surface restoration is not made by the
public utility or private contractor, in accordance with the provisions of
division (c) of this section, the City shall complete such surface restoration
and the cost thereof shall be charged to and paid by the public utility or
private contractor not later than 30 days after the surface restoration work
has been completed by the City. In the event such payment is not made by the
public utility or private contractor within the aforesaid 30-day period, the
surface restoration cost shall be charged against the guarantee bond or other
surety given by the public utility or private contractor. Whenever, as the
result of charges made against such bond or surety, the remaining balance of
such bond or other surety is 50% or less of its original amount, as above-
stated, such public utility or private contractor shall submit a renewal
guarantee bond or other surety in the maximum required amount of such guarantee
bond or other surety, as provided above.

      (2)   Nothing hereinbefore contained shall prohibit the Director of
Public Safety and Service from requiring the posting of bonding in excess of
the limits hereinbefore stated, when in the sole and absolute discretion and
determination of the said Director that the scope and circumstances involved in
a proposed opening shall warrant to posting of such additional bonding amount.
(Ord. 03-97. Passed 9-16-03; Ord. 07-92.  Passed 8-7-07.)
1020.03   NOTICE REQUIRED.
   Before commencing to open a public street or public ground, each applicant,
after obtaining the permit required pursuant to Section
1020.01, and posting all applicable bonds or letters of credit, shall have the
proposed area of opening examined by the Ohio Pubic Utilities Commission for
underground infrastructure.  Additionally, the applicant shall notify the City
Engineer not less than two working days in advance of such excavation.  Such

real emergency, such two days' prior notice may be dispensed with.  However, in
no event shall excavation be commenced without prior notice given to the City
Engineer.

herein unless another meaning is clearly apparent in the language or context.
      (1)   "Owner" means:
         A.   In the case of land, any person who is recorded on the tax

      (3)   "City of Greenville" means the Safety-Service Director or his/her

   (b)   Sidewalk Assessment Policy.
      (1)   In addition to the power conferred upon municipal corporations
under R.C. §727.01 to construct sidewalks, curbs, or gutters and levy an
assessment therefor, the legislative authority of a municipal corporation may
require the construction or repair of sidewalks, curbs, or gutters within the
municipal corporation by the owners of lots or lands abutting thereon, and upon
the failure of such owners to construct or repair such sidewalks, curbs, or
gutters within the time prescribed in the resolution adopted under R.C.
§729.02, may cause such sidewalks, curbs or gutters to be constructed or
repaired and assess the total cost thereof against the lots or lands abutting
thereon, notwithstanding the provisions of R.C. §§727.03 and 727.05.
      (2)   In order to provide a safe and ongoing environment for pedestrian
traffic throughout the City of Greenville, the following sidewalk assessment
policy shall be implemented according to the following procedures:
         A.   The City will evaluate existing sidewalk conditions throughout
designated areas as selected by City Council that needs to replace, repair or
install sidewalks. Curbs may or may not be taken under consideration depending
on individual situations.
            1.   A sidewalk section shall be replaced when the City determines
any of the following conditions are present:
               a.   Adjoining blocks or portions thereof whose edges differ
vertically by one-half inch or more.
               b.   Where a slab has pitted, spalled, scalled or deteriorated
twenty-five percent or more of its surface.
               c.   When adjacent to curb, any offset over one inch, other than
crosswalks.
               d.   Blocks having depressions, reverse cross-slopes, or below
curb grade.
               e.   Blocks that are settled due to underground utility
laterals.
               f.   Where a portion of the sidewalk or driveway apron is
missing.
               g.   Where a slab rocks or moves under the weight of a
pedestrian.
               h.   Where diagonal, transverse and longitudinal cracks
interconnect forming a series of polygons resembling an alligator skin.
            2.   A sidewalk section may be repaired via horizontal cutting when
adjoining blocks or portions thereof exceed one-quarter inch of vertical
separation. Such planar slopes shall not exceed 1:2 slope.
         B.   Once the targeted areas for the upcoming year are determined, the
City will notify the appropriate property owners of the intent and scope of the
proposed project and address the property owner's responsibility to perform the
sidewalk improvement and their right to appeal administrative decisions, by
serving written notice to the City within thirty days requesting review by the
Safety Committee of Council which decision shall be final.
         C.   The Safety/Service Director will present to Council the
recommendations for sidewalk improvement projects including the property owner
names, addresses, and estimates of assessment. If it is deemed necessary by
Council to construct or repair the sidewalks, as recommended pursuant to the
foregoing, Council shall cause plans, specifications and an estimate of cost of
the proposed construction or repair to be prepared, showing the location and
dimension of the sidewalks to be so repaired or constructed. Such plans,
specifications and estimate shall be filed with the office of the Clerk of
Council.
         D.   After filing the plans, specifications, and estimate of cost,
Council may adopt a resolution of necessity, declaring the necessity of the
construction or repair described in such plans. Such resolution shall:
            1.   Approve the plans, specifications, and estimate of cost;
            2.   Describe the lots and lands abutting the proposed sidewalks to
be constructed or repaired by the termini of the improvement or by street
address;
            3.   Set forth that such sidewalks shall be constructed or repaired
by the owners of the lots or lands abutting thereon in accordance with the
plans and specifications on file;
            4.   Set forth the time in which such work shall be completed by
such owners, in compliance with City of Greenville Standards, which time shall
not be less than thirty days of the passage of the resolution of necessity; and
            5.   State that if such sidewalks are not constructed or repaired
by the owners in accordance with such plans and specifications, and within such
time period, that the City shall so construct or repair the sidewalks and
shall, thereafter, assess the cost thereof against the abutting property.
         E.   Notice of the passage of the resolution of necessity shall be
served by the Clerk of Council upon the owner of the property abutting the
sidewalks to be constructed or repaired. Service of such notice shall be by one
of the following methods:
            1.   In the same manner as service of summons is accomplished in a
civil case;
            2.   By certified mail addressed to such owner at his or her last
known address or to the address to which the tax bills are sent; or
            3.   By a combination of the foregoing methods.
         If any such owner cannot be found by any of the above methods, such
owner shall be served by publication of the notice on the official City of
Greenville website.
         F.   The foregoing notice shall set forth the following:
            1.   Where the plans and specifications are on file;
            2.   The time within which an affected property owner may complete
such sidewalk construction or repair; and
            3.   State that if such owner does not construct or repair such
sidewalks in accordance with the plans and specifications, and within such
time, the City shall do so and shall, thereafter, assess the cost thereof
against the property of such owner.
         G.   After expiration of the time within which property owners may
construct or repair the sidewalks, the City shall cause the construction or
repair of the sidewalks which have not been constructed or repaired by the
abutting property owner.
         H.   Should the abutting owner not construct or repair the sidewalks
in accordance with the plans and specifications and within such time, after the
construction or repair of the sidewalks has been completed by the City, the
total cost of such construction or repair shall be ascertained and reported to
Council by the Clerk of Council.
         I.   Council shall thereupon cause a list of estimated assessments to
be prepared and placed on file for inspection in the office of the Clerk of
Council.
         J.   Council shall publish notice that the estimated assessments have
been made and that the same are on file in the office of the Clerk of Council
for inspection. Such notice shall be published on the City of Greenville
website for three consecutive weeks.
         K.   Any person who objects may file a written objection with the
Clerk of Council within two weeks after the expiration of the notice required
pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph.
         L.   After review of any objection(s) filed pursuant to the
immediately preceding paragraph, Council shall adopt an ordinance levying upon
the property enumerated in the list of estimated assessments, with such changes
as Council determines to be proper after consideration of any objection(s)
filed. The said ordinance shall state the following:
            1.   The number of annual installments, not exceeding ten over
which the assessments are payable;
            2.   The interest rate to be charged (generally, the same rate as
the bonds, if any, issued in anticipation of the collection thereof or the
average short-term interest rate earned by the City on its investments); and
            3.   Shall establish a period during which such assessments may be
paid in cash.
         M.   The levy of assessments shall be filed with the Darke County
Auditor within twenty days following the passage of the assessing ordinance
referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
         N.   Upon passage of the afore-referenced ordinance assessing
assessments, Council shall publish a notice of such passage and that such
assessment has been made and is on file in the office of the Clerk of Council
for public inspection. Such notice shall be published once in a newspaper of
general circulation within the City.

determined by the Mayor or other person as authorized in thus section, where
there exists insufficient or inadequate water supply or pressure to provide
safe and adequate water service to the City or portions thereof.
   (b)   Authorization. The Mayor or other person, as authorized in this
section, is hereby authorized to declare a water use restriction for the entire
City, or portions thereof, whenever the Mayor or such other person determines
that significant water supply or pressure problems exist within the City, or
portions thereof, to warrant such action. Such restriction shall exist from the
time it is formally announced until the time it is formally cancelled.
   (c)   Announcement by News Media. Whenever a water use restriction is
declared, the Mayor or other authorized person shall request the local news
media to announce the existence of the restriction, its time of operation and
the area in which it will apply. Cancellation shall be accomplished in the same
manner.
   (d)   Prohibitions on Water Use. Whenever a water use restriction is in
effect, all forms of nonessential water use, including lawn sprinkling, car
washing or uses specifically set forth by the Mayor or other authorized person,
within the water use restriction, shall be prohibited, except to the extent
that such water use comes from a private water supply.
   (e)   Absence or Inability of Mayor. In the absence or inability of the
Mayor to declare such water use restriction, the President of Council shall be
vested with all of the same rights, duties and obligations afforded to the
Mayor in this regard.
   (f)   Application of Prohibition. Once such a water use restriction is
declared, the prohibition set forth in this section shall apply to all persons
who receive water service as provided by the City, whether such person resides
within the City or resides outside of the City but receives City water service
through City-owned and maintained water lines.

1042.08   BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES.
   (a)   If, in the judgment of the Superintendent of Water Plant Distribution

safety of the public water system, the Superintendent will give notice to the
water user to install such an approved device.  The water user shall, at his or
her own expense, install such an approved device at a location and in a manner
approved by the Superintendent and shall have inspections and tests made of
such approved device as required by the Superintendent.
   (b)   No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established, or maintain or permit to be maintained, any connection whereby a
private, auxiliary, emergency or other water supply, other than the regular
public water supply of the City, may enter the supply or distribution system of
said City, unless such private, auxiliary, emergency or other water supply, and
the method of connection and use of such supply, shall have been approved by
the Superintendent.
   (c)   It shall be the duty of the Superintendent to cause surveys and
investigations to be made of industrial and other properties served by the
public water supply where actual or potential hazards to the public water
supply may exist.  Such surveys and investigations shall be made a matter of
public record and shall be repeated as often as the Superintendent shall deem
necessary.
   (d)   The Superintendent or his or her duly authorized representative shall
have the right to enter, at any reasonable time, any property served by a
connection to the public water supply or distribution system of the City for
the purpose of inspecting the piping system or systems thereof.  On demand, the
owner, lessees or occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the
Superintendent any information which he or she may request regarding the piping
system or systems or water use on such property.  The refusal of such
information, when demanded, shall, within the discretion of the Superintendent,
be deemed evidence of the presence of improper connections as provided in this
section.
   (e)   The Superintendent is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue,
after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service to any
property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions of this section
exists, and to take such other precautionary measures as he or she may deem
necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water supply. 
Water service to such property shall not be restored until such conditions
shall have been eliminated or corrected in compliance with the provisions of
this section.

Standard for control of toxic pollutants as designated in Section 307(a) of the
Federal Act for a particular industrial subcategory, the Federal Standard, if
more stringent than the limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in
that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under
this chapter, and such Federal Categorical Standards shall be met by industrial
users.  The Pretreatment Coordinator shall notify all users of the applicable
reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12.
      (2)   Where the City's wastewater treatment works achieves consistent
removal of pollutants limited by Federal Pretreatment Standards, the City may
apply to the State Approval Authority for modification of specific limits in
the Federal Pretreatment Standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean reduction
in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by
the wastewater treatment works to a less toxic or harmless state in the
effluent which is achieved by the system in ninety-five percent of the samples
taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in Section 403.7(c)
(2) and amendments thereto of (Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulation, Part
403) "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of
Pollution," promulgated pursuant to the Act. The City may modify pollution
discharge limits in the Federal Pretreatment Standards if the requirements
contained in 4 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the Approval
Authority is obtained.
      (3)   New sources shall install and have in operating condition, and
shall "startup" pollution control equipment required to meet applicable
pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge.  Within the shortest
feasible time (not to exceed ninety days), new sources must meet all applicable
pretreatment standards. New sources are required to include information on
pretreatment methods they intend to use, and provide data on production, flow
and amounts of regulated pollutants on a schedule as determined by the
Pretreatment Coordinator.
      (4)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in term of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may convert the limits to equivalent limitations
expressed either as equivalent mass per day or concentration limits for
purposes of calculation effluent limitations applicable to individual
industrial users.
      (5)   Equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with paragraphs CFR
403.6 (c)(3) and CFR 403.6 (c)(4) shall be deemed pretreatment standards for
the purposes of Section 307(d) of the Act and this chapter. Industrial user
will be required to comply with the equivalent limitations promulgated
categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
   (i)   State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any
case where they are more stringent than Federal requirements and limitations or
those in this chapter.
   (j)   Consistent with Federal regulations, the City reserves the right to
establish by or ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on
discharges to the wastewater disposal facility if deemed necessary to comply
with the objectives of this chapter.
   (k)   (1)   The limits of an industry's wastewater discharge will be
stipulated in wastewater discharge permits issued by the District to an
industry following submittal by the industry of an application to use the
District's sanitary sewer system for the discharge of its industrial waste,
such applications and permits being subject to the provisions of this chapter.
Such limits shall be established by the Pretreatment Coordinator for each
industry in a manner for each industry in a manner to assure that the
concentrations of those wastes will not exceed the limits stipulated in this
chapter or any other applicable State and Federal standards.
      (2)   The discharge of industrial wastes with concentrations exceeding
the "normal strength" limitations may be permitted when, in the opinion of the
Pretreatment Coordinator, it is determined that such wastes can be
satisfactorily treated without adverse effects to the collection and/or
treatment systems, and such extra strength waste allowance does not violate
applicable Federal standards.
      (3)   The discharge of such wastes exceeding "normal strength" shall be
subject to and require a surcharge to compensate the District for all costs
associated with the collection, conveyance, treatment and final disposal for
all excess concentrations as hereinafter provided in Section
1045.07(h).
   (l)   Where any private pretreatment facilities are provided for any waters
or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactorily and
effective operation by the user of such treatment facilities at his or her
expense. The operation of such pretreatment facilities shall be in accordance
with the Federal Environmental Protection Agency Pretreatment Standards as may
be in effect.
   In addition, the Pretreatment Coordinator may establish Best Management
Practices (BMPs) for particular groups of users. These BMPs may include, but
are not limited to types or methods of pretreatment technology to be used,
methods of source control, minimum maintenance requirements, dragout prevention
practices, spill prevention practices, or other requirements as deemed
necessary.
   (m)   Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable
pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase
the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as
a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance
with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The Pretreatment Coordinator may
impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases where the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
   (n)   (1)   The Pretreatment Coordinator shall evaluate whether each SIU
needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan at least once during the term
of each significant industrial user's industrial wastewater discharge permit or
applicable control document or within one year of being identified a
significant industrial user.  The Pretreatment Coordinator may require any user
to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan. Where
deemed necessary by the Pretreatment Coordinator, facilities to prevent
accidental discharge or slug discharges of pollutants shall be provided and
maintained at the user's cost and expense.
      (2)   An accidental discharge/slug control plan showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
Pretreatment Coordinator for review and approval before implementation. The
Pretreatment Coordinator shall determine which user is required to develop a
plan and require said plan to be submitted within ninety days after
notification by the Pretreatment Coordinator. Each user shall implement its
accidental discharge/slug control plan as submitted or as modified after such
plan has been reviewed and approved by the Pretreatment Coordinator.  Review
and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the Pretreatment
Coordinator shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify and
operate its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this section.
Each industrial user required to implement an accidental discharge/slug control
plan shall notify the City of any significant changes to the user's operations
or systems that might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at
least ninety days prior to the change.
      (3)   Any user required to develop and implement an accidental discharge/
slug control plan shall submit a plan that addresses, at a minimum, the
following:
         A.   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
         B.   Description of stored chemicals;
         C.   Procedures for immediately notifying the WWTP of any accidental
or slug discharge. Such notification shall also be given for any discharge that
would violate any of the standards in this chapter; and
         D.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
      (4)   Users shall notify the City WWTP immediately upon the occurrence of
a "slug" or "accidental discharge" of substances regulated by the chapter.
Users shall notify the Pretreatment Coordinator or personnel on duty at the
WWTP by telephone immediately upon the occurrence of a slug load or accidental
discharge, or bypass or substances prohibited or limited by this chapter.  The
notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type
of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. Any affected user
shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the WWTP, in addition to
the amount of any assessments or penalties imposed on the City on account
thereof under State or Federal law.
      (5)   Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall
submit to the Pretreatment Coordinator a detailed written report describing the
cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. The user shall document and maintain sufficient
records so as to reflect fairly and accurately any such discharge, including,
but not limited to, bypasses of pretreatment facilities. Such notification
shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability
that may be incurred as a result of damage to the WWTP, fish kills, or any
other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the
user of any assessments, civil penalties, or other liability that may be
imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
      (6)   Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the
user's premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or
accidental discharge.  Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or
discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures.
   (o)   (1)   Any removal and hauling of captured material not performed by
the user's personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste disposal
firms. All such materials, plus any prohibited wastes, must be transported to a
State approved disposal site.
      (2)   No user shall discharge or cause to be discharged, directly or
indirectly, any trucked or hauled pollutants, including septage and industrial
waste, except at locations and times designated by the WWTP.
   (p)   (1)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the District and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the District for treatment, subject to the proper payment
therefore by the industrial concern, and provided that such agreement does not
violate applicable Federal standards.
      (2)   Any agreement entered into under the provisions of this section
shall stipulate the type and amount of pollutant and/or conditions permitted
thereunder, the conditions of permitting such discharges and the amount of
surcharge in addition to applicable user and industrial cost recovery charges
that will adequately compensate the District for all costs associated with
collecting, pumping, treating and disposing of such discharges.

Coordinator to ensure compliance with this chapter.
   (e)   Permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed
five years. A permit may be issued for any time period of one year or more but
less than five years, or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The permit
holder shall apply for permit reissuance not less than ninety days prior to the
expiration of the existing permit. The Pretreatment Coordinator shall not be
required to reissue any permit for the same length of time as the original
period which the reissued permit replaces.
   (f)   Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a
specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or
transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises or a new or
changed operation without the prior written approval of the Pretreatment
Coordinator. Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and
conditions of the existing permit.
   (g)   (1)   The Pretreatment Coordinator may require industrial users to
submit periodic discharge reports, including, but not limited to,
questionnaires, technical reports, sampling reports, test analyses and reports
of wastewater discharged.
      (2)   When a report filed by an industrial user pursuant to this section
is not adequate in the judgment of the Pretreatment Coordinator, he or she may
require the user to supply such additional information as is necessary.
      (3)   All industrial users shall promptly notify the Pretreatment
Coordinator in advance of any substantial changes in the volume or character of
pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous
wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under
40 CFR 403.12(p).
      (4)   As a minimum, the Pretreatment Coordinator may require industrial
users having an average monthly water use greater than 500 cubic feet to
complete and file an industrial wastewater survey form. An industrial user,
determined to be a major contributing industry as defined herein, shall be
required to file and submit periodic reports on the characteristics and volume
of its discharge as required by the Federal and State EPA. If there has been no
change in the volume or characteristics of the wastewater, the form may be
filed indicating no change.
      (5)   All reports required as a result of these regulations shall contain
the results of sampling and analysis of the industrial discharge, including the
flow and the nature and concentration or production and mass, where requested
by the Pretreatment Coordinator, of pollutants contained therein which are
limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. If sampling performed by an
industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the Pretreatment
Coordinator within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation. The
industrial user shall submit the results of the repeat analysis to the
Pretreatment Coordinator within thirty days after becoming aware of the
violation.
   (h)   Significant major industries and other industrial users designated by
the Pretreatment Coordinator are required to maintain plant records relating to
wastewater discharge, as specified by the Pretreatment Coordinator, and to
afford the Pretreatment Coordinator or any person authorized to represent him
or her access to these records immediately when so requested by the
Pretreatment Coordinator or his or her authorized representative during normal
business hours. Records shall be retained for at least three years.
   (i)   Industrial users subject to categorical standards will submit baseline
reports, pretreatment compliance schedules, compliance reports, compliance
deadline reports and periodic compliance reports as required in 40 CFR 403.12.
   The Pretreatment Coordinator shall require reporting by users with
applicable standards that require compliance with a BMP or a pollution
prevention alternative to provide documentation to determine compliance with
the standard when submitting their periodic report on continued compliance.
   (j)   (1)   When required by the Pretreatment Coordinator, industrial users
shall install a suitable control manhole(s), together with necessary samplers,
meters, recorders and other appurtenances to adequately sample and measure the
wastes discharged.
      (2)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.
The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
      (3)   In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the
District to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
      (4)   Whether constructed on pubic or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the District's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety days following
written notification by the Director.
   (k)   (1)   For baseline monitoring and compliance reporting purposes, a
minimum of four grab samples shall be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil
and grease, sulfide, and/or volatile organics. For periodic report on continued
compliance reporting purposes, single grab samples shall be used for pH,
hexavalent chromium, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and/or
volatile organics. Except for those pollutants that are required to be measured
by grab samples (referenced above), all other pollutants will be measured by
flow-proportional sampling unless justification for an alternate sampling type,
representative of the discharge, is documented in the industrial user file.
Multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis as follows: for hexavalent chromium, cyanide,
total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or
in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be
composited in the laboratory. Protocols (including appropriate preservation)
specified in 40 CFR 136 and appropriate U.S. EPA guidance must be followed. For
all other pollutants, twenty-four hour composite samples shall be obtained
through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques. The City may require
an industrial user to install flow monitoring facilities, instruments, and
recording devices to enable accurate measurement of flows as determined to be
necessary. The Pretreatment Coordinator may waive flow-proportional composite
sampling for any user that demonstrates that flow-proportional is not feasible.
In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite
sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent
being discharged. Industrial users with applicable standards that require
compliance with a BMP or a pollution prevention alternative shall submit
documentation to determine compliance with the standard when submitting
baseline or periodic compliance reports.
      (2)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated or
manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists or as determined by the
Pretreatment Coordinator and/or contained in the user's wastewater discharge
permit. For categorical users, if other wastewaters are mixed with the
regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user shall measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40
CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the Applicable Categorical
Pretreatment Standards. For other SIUs, for which the City has adjusted its
local limits to factor out dilution flows, the user shall measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment
standard(s).
      (3)   All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges from the user. If sampling and analyses are performed more
frequently than required for any parameters required by the user's industrial
waste permit, using test procedures prescribed by 40 CFR Part 136 or amendments
thereto, or otherwise approved by EPA or as specified in the user's permit, at
the designated sample location(s) - then the results shall be reported to the
Pretreatment Coordinator.
      (4)   If at any time, industrial user self-monitoring sampling data
indicates a violation of permit limitations, the industrial user must notify
the Pretreatment Coordinator within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the
violation. If a violation is detected through sampling and analysis conducted
by the City in lieu of the industrial user, the City shall perform the repeat
sampling and analysis within thirty days of becoming aware of the violation. 
The City may notify the industrial user of the violation and may require the
industrial user to perform the repeat sampling and analysis.
      (5)   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136,
unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard.
If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by the Pretreatment Coordinator. Sampling methods,
locations, times, duration, and frequencies are to be determines on an
individual basis subject to approval by the Pretreatment Coordinator. Users
cannot use samples taken by the City to fulfill self-monitoring requirements.
      (6)   When self-monitoring analyses are required of a user, the user,
upon approval of the Pretreatment Coordinator, make arrangements with a
laboratory, including that of the user, to perform such analyses. The
measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of wastewater required
by the section shall be performed by a laboratory acceptable to the
Pretreatment Coordinator.
   (l)   All industrial users shall promptly notify the Pretreatment
Coordinator in advance of any substantial changes in the volume or character of
pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous
wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under
40 CFR 403.12(p). All required reports shall contain the following
certification statement:
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gathered and evaluate the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage
the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine
and imprisonment for knowing violations".
   All reports required herein shall be signed as follows:
      (1)   By a responsible corporate officer if the industrial user
submitting the reports required herein is a corporation. For the purpose of
this paragraph, a responsible corporate officer means:
         A.   A president, secretary, treasurer or vice-president of the
corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who
performs similar policy or decision-making functions for the corporation; or
         B.   The manager of one or more manufacturing, production or operating
facilities employing more than 250 persons or having gross annual sales or
expenditures exceeding twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) (in second
quarter 1980 dollars), if authority to sign documents has been assigned or
delegated to the manager in accordance with corporate procedures.
      (2)   By a general partner or proprietor if the industrial user
submitting the required reports is a partnership or sole proprietorship,
respectively.
      (3)   By a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in
paragraph (l)(1)A. or (l)(1)B. hereof if:
         A.   The authorization is made in writing by the individual described
in paragraph (l)(1)A. or (l)(1)B. hereof;
         B.   The authorization specified either an individual or a position
having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility from which the
industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager or a
position of equivalent responsibility, or having overall responsibility for
environmental matters for the company; and
         C.   The written authorization is submitted to the Pretreatment
Coordinator.
      (4)   If an authorization under paragraph (l)(3) hereof is no longer
accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the
overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental
matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of
paragraph (l)(3) hereof must be submitted to the Pretreatment Coordinator prior
to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
   (m)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standard if the requirements of
this subsection are met. An industrial user who wishes to establish the
affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the specific
cause(s) of the upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
      (3)   The industrial user has submitted the following information to the
Pretreatment Coordinator within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the
upset (if this information is provided orally, written submission must be
provided within five days):
         A.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         B.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue;
         C.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of any upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   In the usual exercise of prosecutorial discretion, City enforcement
personnel may review any claims that non-compliance was caused by an upset. No
determinations made in the course of the review constitute final action subject
to judicial review. Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
      (6)   The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to
the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the
facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary
source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
      (7)   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the Pretreatment Coordinator, if possible at least
ten days before the date of the bypass.
      An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass
that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the Pretreatment Coordinator
or duly authorized agent of the City within twenty-four hours from the time the
industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall contain
a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and the steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the bypass. The Pretreatment
Coordinator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within twenty-four hours.
      Bypass is prohibited, and the Pretreatment Coordinator may take
enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless all of the
following are true:
         A.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage.
         B.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance.
         C.   The industrial user submitted notices as required in this
chapter. The Pretreatment Coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Pretreatment Coordinator determines
that it will meet the conditions listed in this section.
   (n)   (1)   The Pretreatment Coordinator and other duly authorized agents of
the City bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to
enter all properties for the purpose of inspection, examination and copying of
records, observation, measurement, sampling and testing in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. The Pretreatment Coordinator or his or her

to herein, the Pretreatment Coordinator or duly authorized representative of
the City shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established
by the company and the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to
the City employees and the City shall indemnify the company against loss or
damage to its property by City agents and against liability claims and demands
for personal injury or property damage asserted against the company and growing
out of the gauging and sampling operation, except as such may be caused by
negligence or failure of the company to maintain safe conditions as required in
subsection (j) hereof.
      (3)   The Pretreatment Coordinator or his or her duly authorized
representative bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted
to enter all private properties through which the City holds a duly negotiated
easement for the purpose of. but not limited to, inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of sewerage works
lying within such easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on such
easement.
      All entry and subsequent work, if any, on such easement, pertaining to
the private property involved.
   (o)   (1)   Any industrial user who disagrees with the results of metering
and/or monitoring of its industrial wastes may make a written appeal to the
Pretreatment Coordinator. Any such written appeal shall include the owner's
name, the location of the industrial site and the nature of the appeal. The
Pretreatment Coordinator shall review or cause to be reviewed any such appeal.
The Pretreatment Coordinator may then accept any evidence that testing
conducted by qualified persons of the appellant's choice and at the sole
expense of the appellant.
      (2)   Such independent tests shall be conducted as nearly as possible to
the same date and time as similar tests are conducted by the District. The
results of the two tests shall be compared and a mutual settlement reached. In
the event mutual agreement is not made, the matter shall be referred to the
Safety/Service Director who shall make a final ruling in such dispute.
   (p)   (1)   When requested by the industrial user furnishing a report,
permit application or questionnaire, the portions of the report or other
document which might disclose information advantageous to competitors shall not
be made available for inspection by the public, provided, however, that such

1045.07  SEWER SERVICE CHARGE AND OTHER SEWERAGE SYSTEM CHARGES.
   (a)   Every person, firm, or corporation whose premises are served by a
sewer connection which discharges sanitary wastewater, industrial wastes, water
or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into wastewater facilities
under the jurisdiction of the District, will be charged for the use of such
facilities and for the treatment of such wastewater and wastes.  The user
charge shall be applied to each and every premise discharging into the sewerage
works.
   (b)   The sewer service charge will consist of a minimum charge and a usage
charge. The minimum charge shall be based on the size of the water meter(s)
used at the premises served.  The usage charge shall be based upon the quantity
of water used, as measured by the water meter(s).  The meter(s) shall be
acceptable in design and type to the District.
   (c)   When a premise is served by more than one water meter a minimum and
usage charge will be made for each meter.
   (d)   When a premise is supplied in whole or part with water from wells or
any source other than the public water supply, and which discharges to
wastewater facilities under the jurisdiction of the District, such wells or
other source shall be approved by the WWTP Superintendent.  The owner of the
premises shall install and maintain at his expense a meter or meters acceptable
to the City and the quantity of water used shall determine sewer service
charges as measure by the meter(s).  The meter size shall determine tap-in
charges and usage estimates may be made for faulty meters.
   (e)   The WWTP Superintendent shall make and enforce such additional rules
and regulations as he or she deem necessary for the enforcement of the
provisions hereof, for the proper determination and collection of the rates and
charges herein provided and for the safe, efficient and economical management
of the system.  Such rules and regulations, when not repugnant to existing laws
of the State and/or United States Environmental Protection Agency rules and
regulations, shall have the same force and effect as if they were a part
hereof.
   (f)   Each year the Safety/Service Director and the Utility Committee shall
review service charges. This review shall be in accordance with the following.
      (1)   The service charges shall cause distribution of the costs of
operation, maintenance, replacement, and improvement of the wastewater system
within the City's jurisdiction to each user class in proportion to the user's
contribution to the total wastewater loading of the wastewater system. Factors
such as strength, volume and delivery, and flow rate characteristics shall be
considered and included as the basis for the user's contribution to ensure
proportional distribution of operation, maintenance, replacement, improvement,
and other authorized costs to each user class.
      (2)   The service charges shall be reviewed annually and revised
periodically to reflect actual wastewater system operation, maintenance, and
other authorized costs.
   (g)   Because a District sewer is available to any lot, parcel of land,
building or premises which is improved, it is a conclusive presumption that
wastewater from said lot, parcel of land or premises which is improved is
discharged into such sewer, and the premises or property shall be billed for
wastewater service charges as provided herein. Any lot, parcel of land or
premises abutting a street, alley or easement in which there is a District
sewer shall be deemed to have available access to a District sewer. In
conformance with the provisions of Sections
1045.02 and
1045.05, all users required to make connection with District sewers shall
obtain a street opening and applicable bonding permit. The Engineering
Department may assess users for the following application, permit, inspection
and connection fees as necessary:
      (1)   A permit fee shall be charged to all users making application for a
sanitary sewer permit.  The fee for such permits may be changed whenever
necessary as determined by the Utility Committee and approved by the City
Council.
      (2)   All sewer connections shall be in conformance with standards set
forth in this chapter. All costs and expense incident to the inspection,
installation and connection of the lateral shall be borne by the owner as
provided in Section
1045.04(c) and (d). Any required connection charges or tap-in fees shall be
paid in full before a sewer application is approved or a sewer permit is
issued. The amount of such sewer connection charges shall be determined by the
Utility Committee and approved by the City Council. The amount of such
connection charges or tap-in fees shall not be less than the amount assessed
for similar properties and shall be in addition to any permit fees or other
fees required.
      (3)   Industrial wastewater discharge permit applications shall be in
conformance with the requirements of Section
1045.06(b) and other provisions of this chapter. The Pretreatment Coordinator
may assess applicants for additional costs related to plan review, waste
analysis and related matters, as applicable.
   (h)   The Pretreatment Coordinator shall assess users for any additional
fees, costs and expenses as may be necessary due to enforcement actions and
legal fees, costs and damages from slug discharges and accidental spill, any
special, nonroutine pretreatment compliance monitoring surveillance, analysis
and review and/or other just cause allocable to an individual user. 
(Ord. 91-130. Passed 11-5-91.)

      (2)   Computation of sewer use surcharge.
         A.   A sewer use surcharge shall be assessed for extra strength
wastewater for which the concentration for BOD, suspended solids or other
pollutants in normal strength wastewater.
         Surcharges shall also be assessed for the City's cost of consistently
removing toxic pollutants subject to Federal Categorical Standards at the
City's wastewater treatment facilities.
         Wastewater pollutant concentrations shall be determined from the
industrial monitoring program and any necessary special surveillance, user's
self-monitoring data and/or EPA compliance monitoring data.
         Surcharges shall be added to a user's sewer use charges and shall
remain in effect as long as normal strength wastewater values are exceeded.
         B.   Surcharges shall be computed in accordance with the model below:
            Cs = K(BcB + ScS + PcP) Vu
            Where:
               Cs =    surcharge for extra strength waste.
               K =   concentration to mass loading conversion factor equal to
0.00626.
               Bc =   unit operating cost for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
in $/pound.
               B =    concentration (mg/l) of BOD from a user above 250 mg/l
(normal strength wastewater).
               Sc =   unit operating cost for suspended solids (nonfilterable
residue) in $/pound.
               S =    concentration (mg/l) of suspended solids from a user
above 250 mg/l (normal strength wastewater).
               Pc =   unit operating cost of any pollutant in $/pound.
               P =   concentration (mg/l) of any pollutant from a user above
normal strength wastewater concentration.
               Vu =   a user's total water usage or wastewater discharge in 100
cubic feet per unit of time.
         C.   The unit sewer use surcharges shall be as follows:
            BOD surcharge (Bc) effective July 1, 1991, and thereafter = $0.29/
pound.
            SS surcharge (Sc) effective July 1, 1991, and thereafter = $0.24/
pound.
            Other pollutant unit surcharges (Pc) shall be developed at the time
the need for a surcharge arises.
         D.   Basis for charge; minimum.  For lots, parcels of land, buildings
or premises using water exclusively supplied by the District, the sewer service
charge or rental shall be based upon the quantity of water used thereon or
therein, as measured by the District water meters installed or approved by the
Superintendent, and shall be at the rate as provided in this section for each
100 cubic feet of water consumed. However, in no event shall such sewer sendee
charge or rental be less than sixty-five dollars and thirty-eight cents
($65.38) per annum effective July 1, 1991, and thereafter, for each connection
with the system, which charges are hereby declared to be minimum charges.
(Ord. 90-66. Passed 6-19-90.)
      (3)   Computation of special capital recovery district surcharges.
         A.   A special Capital Recovery District surcharge shall be imposed
for recovery of total debt service costs (including principal, interest, paying
agent and bond registrar costs, and all costs relating to the issuance of bonds
and notes in anticipation thereof, all of which debt service costs are herein
referred to as "debt costs") for the total construction and nonconstruction
costs of providing District sewer services to the previously unsewered area, to
all users in the Special Capital Recovery District.
         B.   Sewer use Special Capital Recovery District surcharges shall be
computed in accordance with the model below:
            SDd = (SDa/SDt)SDu
            Where:
               SDs = a user's Special Capital Recovery District surcharge.
               SDa = Special Capital Recovery District debt costs.
               SDt = total Special Recovery District volume contribution per
unit of time.
               SDu = a user's total water or wastewater discharge in 100 cubic
feet (cf) per unit of time.
               SDa/SDt = unit Special Capital Recovery District surcharge.
         C.   This Special Recovery District surcharge shall expire and
collection of the same shall cease, as applicable to each individual Special
Capital Recovery District, when settlement funds have been collected from all
users in the Special Capital Recovery District to offset total debt costs
relating to the construction and nonconstruction costs for providing the
District sewer services in and for the Special Capital Recovery District.
         D.   A Special Capital Recovery District may be established by the
City only at the written request of all property owners within the area
directly encompassed by the Special Capital Recovery District. The Special
Capital Recovery District shall be defined by a legal metes and bounds
description and drawing to accompany said request. The Safety/Service Director
shall act upon such request to establish a Special Capital Recovery District
with a recommendation to City Council.  The Special Capital Recovery District
shall be effective from the date so established by City Council and shall
remain in full force and effect and applicable to all properties therein until
its expiration as set forth in paragraph (h)(4)C. hereof.
(Ord. 92-98. Passed 7-7-92.)
         E.   The Safety/Service Director with approval of City Council is
hereby authorized and directed to designate the boundaries of the Capital Cost
Recovery Districts which are, from time to time, formed within the City limits
pursuant to this section.
(Ord. 93-150. Passed 9-7-93.)
   (l)   For lots, parcels of land, buildings or premises using water
exclusively supplied by the District, such sewerage service charge or rental
shall be based upon the quantity of water used thereon or therein, as measured
by the District water meters installed or approved by the Superintendent, and
shall be at the rate as provided in subsection (k) hereof.
   (m)   For lots, parcels of land, buildings or premises using water supplied
either in whole or in part from sources other than the waterworks system of the
District, the Superintendent may require the owner or other interested party to
install water meters or other meters satisfactory to the Superintendent finds
it is not practical to measure by meter any water supplied from sources other
than the waterworks system of the District, he or she shall measure the same in
such manner and by such method as he or she may find practical in the light of
the conditions and attending circumstances of the case, provided, further, that
such methods are in accordance with accepted engineering practices. The amount
of water consumed and measured as provided in this subsection, shall then
constitute the base for application of the sewerage service charge or rental
provided in subsection (k) hereof.
   (n)   In the event it can be shown to the satisfaction of the
Superintendent, with respect to any lots, parcels of land, buildings or
premises, that a portion of the water, from any source, consumed on the
premises does not and cannot enter the system, then in each such case the owner
or other interested party may, at his or her expense, install and maintain
separate metering devices which shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Superintendent that portion of the water so consumed on the lots, parcels of
land, buildings or premises which is discharged into the system, and such
portion shall then constitute the base for application of the sewerage service
charge or rental provided in subsection (k) hereof for these lots, parcels of
land, buildings or premises.
   (o)   Bills and notices relating to the conduct of the business of the
District will be mailed to the user at the address listed on the application,
unless a change of address has been filed in writing at the business office of
the District. The District shall not otherwise be responsible for delivery of
any bill or notice, nor will the customer be excused from nonpayment of a bill
or from any performance required in said notice.
   (p)   (1)   Bills for sewer service are due and payable at the business
office of the District, or any designated agent, on their date of issue. The
past due date shall be the sixteenth day of the month after the period of
service. Bills will be dated and mailed each quarter.
      (2)   All bills not paid on or before the past due date shall be deemed
delinquent, and the District shall serve on the user a written final notice of
said delinquency.  If a delinquent bill is not paid within thirty days after
the date due it will be subject to being certified as State law will allow.
   (q)   Where a user is delinquent in the payment of services the District
reserves the right to request a nominal sum to be placed on deposit with the
District for the purpose of establishing and maintaining any customer's credit.
   (r)   The District shall make all reasonable efforts to eliminate
interruption of service, and when such interruption occurs will endeavor to re-
establish service with the shortest possible delay.  Whenever the service is
interrupted for the purpose of working on the collection system or the
treatment equipment, all consumers affected by such interruption will be
notified in advance whenever it is possible to do so.

   (a)   Whenever the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that any user has violated
or is violating any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit,
or any prohibition, limitation of requirement contained herein, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may serve upon such person a written notice stating
the nature of the violation. Within thirty days of the date of the notice, a
plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the
Pretreatment Coordinator by the user.
   (b)   If any discharge to the District sewer violates any provision of this
chapter, the Pretreatment Coordinator may:
      (1)   Require the discharger to demonstrate that in-plant modifications
will reduce or eliminate the objectionable characteristics, or require that
pretreatment and/or flow equalization facilities be provided such that the
discharge will not be in violation;
      (2)   Require the discharger to pay any added cost of handling and
treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes and sewer charges;
      (3)   Take other such remedial action as may be deemed necessary to
achieve the purpose of this chapter; and/or

written notice, etc.
   (c)   Where unsatisfactory response is received upon notification of
violation, or where response is not received within the time limits specified
in subsection (a) hereof, the Pretreatment Coordinator shall order any user who
causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to show cause before an
Administrative Hearing Board, hereinafter called the "Board," composed of the
Safety/Service Director, the Director of Law and the Pretreatment Coordinator,
why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be
served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the
Board regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken and
the proposed enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause before
the Board why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail

1450.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of
The City of Greenville, State of Ohio, does ordain this chapter as follows.
(Ord. 11-69.  Passed 7-7-11.)
1450.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Greenville has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 11-69.  Passed 7-7-11.)
1450.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects:
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 11-69.  Passed 7-7-11.)
1450.04  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 11-69.  Passed 7-7-11.)
1450.05  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Greenville as identified in Section
1450.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City of Greenville.
(Ord. 11-69.  Passed 7-7-11.)
1450.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (a)   Flood Insurance Study Darke County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Darke County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective July 18, 2011.
   (b)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
   (c)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Greenville as required by Section
1450.27 Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City Engineering Office, 100 Public Square,
Greenville, Ohio.
(Ord. 11-69.  Passed 7-7-11.)

these regulations.
(Ord. 11-69.  Passed 7-7-11.)
1450.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Greenville, any officer
or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 11-69.  Passed 7-7-11.)
1450.10  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the

flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject

the flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base
flood elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway

letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary
and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of map amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of map revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.

other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home” a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park” means, as specified in the Ohio
Administrative Code 3701-27-01, any tract of land upon which three or more
manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or
for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle,
or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or
rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National flood insurance program (NFIP)” is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction” means structures for which the “start of
construction” commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of
Greenville Flood Insurance Rate Map, July 18, 1985, and includes any subsequent

111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a

professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered professional surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special Flood Hazard Area” also known as “areas of special flood
hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood
insurance studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary
maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.

condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   (kk)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.

and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and / or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and /or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections
1450.34 through
1450.38, Appeals and Variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 11-69.  Passed 7-7-11.)
1450.23  SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including flood,
tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the Floodplain
Administrator shall:
   (a)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
   (b)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
   (c)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with increased cost of
compliance insurance claims.

   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1450.21(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Mayor of The City of Greenville and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (b)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1450.33(a)(2), items A. and C. through E.
   (c)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of “bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with The
City of Greenville specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1450.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on the
matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file, within
thirty days of the date of such notice and order, or other official action, a
brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any
item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such
appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 11-69.  Passed 7-7-11.)
1450.36  VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (b)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (c)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1450.36(b)(1) to (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 11-69.  Passed 7-7-11.)
1450.37  PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.

INTRODUCTION
1470.01  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.
   The City of Greenville, Ohio (Darke County) is required to submit a storm
water management program (SWMP) in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part 122.32 and
Ohio law. This document contains that program, which will be executed during
the five years of coverage under Ohio's general permit. The goals of our
program are to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent
practicable, to protect water quality, and to satisfy the appropriate
requirements of the Clean Water Act in accordance with the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System and Ohio EPA's Phase II Storm Water program. The
SWMP addresses the six minimum control measures as required by Federal and
State regulations. The Notice of Intent (NOI) and SWMP will be submitted on
January 19, 2007.
(Ord. 07-04.  Passed 1-23-07.)
1470.02  STATEMENT OF AUTHORITY.
   The City of Greenville has the legal authority to perform all of the
activities for which we claim responsibility in this Storm Water Management
Program. These activities include but are not limited to adopting ordinances,
performing inspections, and reviewing planning information. Where we do not
have legal authority, we have assigned that responsibility to another body
possessing the necessary authority to proceed in the manner described. The City
of Greenville has agreed to allow and authorize the Miami Conservancy District
(MCD) to perform certain activities on behalf of Greenville.
(Ord. 07-04.  Passed 1-23-07.)
1470.03  PERMIT COVERAGE AREA.
   The storm water management program covers the area within Greenville
identified by the U.S. census as part of the urbanized area. Greenville has a
population of 13,400 residents, 75.45 miles of roadways and an unknown number
of storm water outfalls of various sizes discharging to the waters of the
State.
(Ord. 07-04.  Passed 1-23-07.)
1470.04  REPORTING.
   Greenville's storm water management program (SWMP) covers the area within
the City corporation limit, as it may from time to time change due to
annexations, etc. Annual reports will be submitted in accordance with permit
requirements. The report will include the status of compliance with the permit
conditions, an assessment of the appropriateness of the BMPs (best management
practices) and progress towards achieving the measurable goals for each of the
six minimum control measures. The report will be a summary of the activities to
be undertaken during the next reporting cycle, including an implementation
schedule. The report will also include any changes to BMPs or measurable goals
and results of information collected and analyzed, if any, during the reporting
period. The report will also contain proposed changes to our SWMP, including
changes to any BMPs or any identified measurable goals that apply to the
program elements. The report will include notice of where we are relying on
another entity to satisfy some of our permit obligations, if applicable.
(Ord. 07-04.  Passed 1-23-07.)
1470.05  STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.
   (a)   The plan outlines the six minimum control measures that are expected
to result in significant reductions in pollutants discharged by Greenville.
   (b)   The six minimum controls are:
      (1)   Public education and outreach on storm water impacts
      (2)   Public involvement/participation
      (3)   Illicit discharge detection and elimination
      (4)   Construction site storm water runoff control
      (5)   Post-construction storm water management in new development and
redevelopment
      (6)   Pollution prevention/good housekeeping for municipal operations
   (c)   Each measure will be addressed separately below. Please note that in
some cases, the “start” and “end” dates have been listed as “permit coverage
date +            months”, or “PCD +          months”. Because the City of
Greenville does not know when permit coverage will be officially conveyed by
Ohio EPA, listing dates in such a manner will allow Greenville the full time
period it believes is required to implement the BMP covered.

(Ord. 07-04.  Passed 1-23-07.)
1470.11  DECISION PROCESS.
   Through research and several watershed-based meetings, the Great Miami River
Watershed Community chose a multi-faceted approach. One of the strongest groups
working on this issue has been a subcommittee on Public Education, Outreach and
Involvement organized under Miami Valley Regional Planning Commission's
watershed group: Lower Miami River Basin Council Watershed Enhancement Program.
This group established a Phase II Storm Water Working Group, which then created
subcommittees to make recommendations for compliance with specific measures of
the storm water regulations. Research the group performed included examinations
of products and programs available from the Huron River Watershed Council, the
Center for Watershed Protection, and River Network. We also examined social
behavior research conducted by the National Geographic Society and Ohio
University. As a result, we have chosen the following strategy to effect change
in the attitudes and behaviors of residents. Details about our plan's
measurable goals, timeline, responsible party, and rationale for choosing those
goals are contained within the program overview chart above.
(Ord. 07-04.  Passed 1-23-07.)
1470.12  RATIONALE STATEMENT.
   (a)   Informing Individuals about Reducing Storm Water Pollution 3.2.1.2.1. 
Our media campaign targets individuals and households regarding the connection
between their personal habits and the health of local streams.
   (b)   Informing Individuals and Groups about Becoming Involved in the Storm
Water Program 3.2.1.2.2.  Our public education component targets individuals
and households regarding the connection between their personal habits and the
quality and health of local streams and rivers. Using multiple means of
communication, it is hoped a renewed interest in water quality will lead to
positive changes in personal habits and behavior.
   (c)   Target Audiences 3.2.1.2.3.
      (1)   This control measure will target homeowners, the general public,
developers, and construction site designers. An informed and knowledgeable
community is crucial to the success of the Storm Water Management Program. As
the public becomes aware of the personal responsibilities expected of them and
others in the community, including the individual actions they can take to
protect or improve the quality of area waters, a greater compliance with the
storm water program will result. The program includes watershed-based efforts
to inform and motivate the public.
      (2)   The public education program will use a variety of strategies in
which to reach a diverse audience. The media campaign will use a mix of media,
in English and Spanish, to reach more citizens than English alone. Training
events target various professional, political and private audiences.
   (d)   Target Pollutant Sources 3.2.1.2.4.  Miami Conservancy District has
chosen a mix of BMPs to address appropriate pollutants in the Great Miami River
Watershed. In addition to raising awareness about watershed function, various
programs will promote proper hazardous waste disposal, sediment and erosion
control, and nutrient reduction.
   (e)   Outreach Strategy 3.2.1.2.5.
      (1)   Media campaign.  In a recent national survey, 67% of Americans did
not know how their everyday actions create water pollution, but most are
willing to change simple behaviors once they are informed. Specific issues
include but are not limited to lawn care, household hazardous waste disposal,
and vehicle maintenance. Through this campaign, we expect to reach 2,000 people
annually or 10,000 people through the permit term.
      (2)   Training events.  Miami Conservancy will coordinate a series of
training events for specific targeted audiences. These events will empower each
audience to protect water resources and reduce storm water pollution. Audiences
to be addressed are: construction site designers, developers, public employees
and youth. The types of events will include but not be limited to interactive
technical workshops and tours of storm water BMPs. Technical workshops and
storm water tours will promote sediment and erosion control as well as
conservation development and the reduction of storm water quantity leaving
construction sites during and following project completion. Through the
training events and tours, we expect to reach 25 professionals annually, or 125
people throughout the permit term.
      (3)   The City of Greenville will initiate the presentation of local
water festivals. These events will target children and create an atmosphere
where learning about protecting water is fun, relevant, and effective. Through
the water festivals, we expect to reach 100 children annually or 500 throughout
the permit term.
   (f)   Responsible Party 3.2.1.2.6.  Miami Conservancy District and the City
of Greenville will be responsible for each of the BMPs within this subchapter
on behalf of Greenville.
   (g)   Evaluation Procedure 3.2.1.2.7.  Miami Conservancy District has
conducted baseline data via a phone survey prior to the beginning of the media
campaign and they will conduct some similar research at the end of the five-
year permit period to determine if public awareness and behaviors have changed
during that time. For the training sessions and tours, success will be
determined by the numbers of people attending and by qualitative data gathered
via program feedback forms.

1470.31  DECISION PROCESS.
   Working groups of staff and public officials met repeatedly over several
months to determine the best possible plan for developing a program to detect
and eliminate illicit discharges in their own communities. A cafeteria list of
options has been presented and we will be choosing the most logical and
effective set of BMPs to suit our own needs. A comparison of the requirements
and the capacity of most jurisdictions by Miami Conservancy District's (MCD)
staff prompted the organization to make a commitment to assist all
collaborating communities by locating these communities' outfalls and
identifying their receiving streams. Details about our plan's measurable goals,
timeline, responsible party, and rationale for choosing those goals are
contained within the program overview chart above.
(Ord. 07-04.  Passed 1-23-07.)
1470.32  RATIONALE STATEMENT.
   (a)   Storm Sewer Map Development Process 3.2.3.2.1.  Greenville maintains
an undetermined number of miles of storm water lines and dozens of catch
basins. Greenville plans on updating its mapping capabilities within the next
several years.
   (b)   Regulatory Mechanism Development 3.2.3.2.2.  Greenville currently has
ordinances that prohibit the discharge of certain pollutants to the MS4.
Greenville will review these ordinances to ensure prohibited discharges listed
in the general NPDES permit are regulated.
   (c)   Enforcement and Implementation 3.2.3.2.3.  Our program will ensure
appropriate enforcement procedures and actions so that implementation of the
illicit discharge detection and elimination program will be effective to the
maximum extent practicable.
   (d)   Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination 3.2.3.2.4.  Greenville
staff will physically inspect storm water outfalls during dry periods of
weather. If water is witnessed during these times, additional investigation of
possible sources of discharge draining to each location will occur. Inspections
of businesses and industries will occur to fully investigate possible sources.
(*See permit additional requirements)
   (e)   Methods of Informing Various Audiences about the Hazards Associated
with Illegal Discharges 3.2.3.2.5.  Greenville will provide education to
various audiences about the hazards of illicit discharges through public
meetings and public service announcements on Greenville Public Access
Television.
   (f)   Responsible Party 3.2.3.2.6.  The responsible party for overall
management and implementation of our storm water illicit discharge detection
and elimination program and the responsible party for each of the BMPs are
defined in the table included above.
   (g)   Evaluation 3.2.3.2.7.  Success will be measured by meeting the
deadlines we have set for our work in developing this program for detecting and
eliminating illicit discharges.

1470.41  DECISION PROCESS.
   As a community involved in the collaborative effort for the Great Miami
River Watershed, we will have the option of meeting with other communities to
create a cohesive and somewhat uniform program for sediment and erosion
control. The benefits of such a joint effort are many and include: the
reduction of the variety of requirements currently in place, simplification of
process for developers in complying with different requirements based on
jurisdictional lines, and sharing of knowledge from neighboring communities.
Though joint program development is available and encouraged, final
responsibility for development and implementation lies with each jurisdiction.
Details about our plan's measurable goals, timeline, responsible party, and
rationale for choosing those goals are contained within the program overview

   (a)   Regulatory Mechanism Development 3.2.4.2.1.  Greenville currently has
ordinances that limit the maximum allowed discharge rate of storm water from
new developments for all but the largest rain events. These ordinances will be
reviewed and updated if necessary.
   (b)   Enforcement 3.2.4.2.2.  Greenville currently has ordinances that
require construction site debris and trash be controlled and properly disposed.

1470.52  RATIONALE STATEMENT.
   (a)   Program and Priority Areas 3.2.5.2.1.  Greenville requires erosion
control measures to be installed prior to soil movement on construction sites.
Routine inspections of these erosion controls practices are required.
Greenville will develop standardized inspection procedures and tracking
documents to ensure adequate inspections occur.
   (b)   Program and Community 3.2.5.2.2.  This program will be tailored to the
local community by minimizing water quality impacts through maintaining pre-
development runoff conditions.
   (c)   Non-structural BMPs as Appropriate 3.2.5.2.3.  Greenville requires
minimum types of structural and non-structural measures to minimize erosion and
sedimentation during construction operations. Greenville will review its list
of approved BMPs and amend the list if warranted to improve BMP adequacy.
   (d)   Structural BMPs as Appropriate 3.2.5.2.4.  As determined practicable
by our community, we will incorporate structural BMPs such as detention/wet
ponds, filtration via grassed swales, bio-retention cells, sand filters, filter
strips, and infiltration basins/ trenches into the program.
   (e)   Regulatory Mechanisms 3.2.5.2.5.  Greenville has adopted and enforces
ordinances voted on by City Council. Greenville believes its current ordinances
are adequate to allow the SWMP to be initially implemented. On-going review of
ordinances will be required.
   (f)   Long-Term Operation and Maintenance 3.2.5.2.6.  O&M will entail
routine review of procedures used to enact BMPs. Through regional meetings with
other MS4 representatives, we will amend our BMPs in a goal to enact “best in
practice” procedures where appropriate.

1470.61  DECISION PROCESS.
   We have established a working group of municipal employees and other
stakeholders to create this section of our Storm Water Management Plan that
addresses pollution prevention and good housekeeping for municipal operations.
Details about our plan's measurable goals, timeline, responsible party, and
rationale for choosing those goals are contained within the program overview
chart above.
(Ord. 07-04.  Passed 1-23-07.)
1470.62  RATIONALE STATEMENT.
   (a)   Operation and Maintenance Program 3.2.6.2.1.  Greenville has one
street sweeper that is used year-round (weather permitting) to remove debris
from curb lines, thus preventing their discharge into the MS4. Greenville plans
on maintaining this vehicle and using it to help remove debris.
   (b)   Government Employee Training Program 3.2.6.2.2.  Annual training of
key employees that routinely operate heavy equipment/vehicles will occur to
provide standardized spill control procedures. It will be the goal to minimize/
prevent the migration of leaks/spills of vehicle fluids into the MS4. Training
in the proper use and disposal of absorbent materials will be provided.
   (c)   Program Description 3.2.6.2.3.  Our program will include maintenance
activities and schedules and long-term inspection procedures to reduce
floatables and pollutants to the MS4. It will provide controls for reducing or
eliminating the discharge of pollutants from streets, roads, highways,
municipal parking lots, maintenance and storage yards, waste transfer stations,
fleet or maintenance shops with outdoor storage areas, and salt/ sand storage
locations and snow disposal areas. Procedures for proper disposal of waste
removed from MS4 and municipal operations will be implemented, including dredge
spoil, accumulated sediments, floatables and other debris. New flood management
projects will assess impacts on water quality and we will assess existing
projects for additional water quality protection devices or practices that
could be added.
   (d)   Responsible Party 3.2,6.2.4.  The responsible party for overall
management and implementation of the storm water post-construction runoff
control program and the responsible party for each of the BMPs are defined in
the table in the program overview chart above.
   (e)   Evaluation 3.2.6.2.5.  Success will be measured by meeting the
deadlines we have set for our work in developing this program for construction
site storm water runoff control.
(Ord. 07-04.  Passed 1-23-07.)

(Ord. 09-14.  Passed 2-17-09.)
1482.05  PROPERTY MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   Title.  These regulations shall be known specifically as the Property
Maintenance Regulations of City of Greenville hereinafter referred to as "this
regulation."
   (b)   Scope.  This regulation is enacted to protect the public health,
safety and welfare in all existing structures, residential and nonresidential,
and on all existing premises by establishing minimum requirements and standards
for premises, structures, equipment, and facilities for light, ventilation,
space, heating, sanitation, protection from the elements, life safety, safety
from fire and other hazards, and for safe and sanitary maintenance; fixing the
responsibility of owners, operators and occupants; regulating the occupancy of
existing structures and premises, and providing for administration, enforcement
and penalties.
   (c)   Intent.  This regulation shall be construed to secure its expressed
intent, which is to ensure public health, safety and welfare insofar as they
are affected by the continued occupancy and maintenance of structures and
premises. Existing structures and premises that do not comply with these
provisions shall be altered or repaired to provide a minimum level of health
and safety as required herein.
   (d)   Application of Other Regulations.  Any repairs, additions or
alterations to a structure, or changes of occupancy, shall be done in
accordance with the procedures and provisions of the building, plumbing and
mechanical regulations of the State of Ohio.
   (e)   Maintenance.  Required: All equipment, systems, devices and safeguards
required by this regulation or a previous statute or regulation for the
structure or premises when erected or altered shall be maintained in good
working order. The requirements of this regulation are not intended to provide
the basis for removal or abrogation of tire protection and safety systems and
devices in existing structures.
      (1)   Duties and powers of the inspecting official.
         A.   General.  An inspecting official shall enforce all of the
provision of this regulation. For purposes of this regulation an "inspecting
official" shall be that person or persons designated by the Chief of the
Greenville Fire Department to conduct property maintenance services within the
City.
         B.   Notices and orders. The inspecting official shall issue all
necessary notices or orders to ensure compliance with this regulation.
         C.   Right of entry. The inspecting official is authorized to enter
the structure or premises at reasonable times to inspect subject to
constitutional restrictions on unreasonable searches and seizures. If entry is
refused or not obtained, the inspecting official is authorized to pursue
recourse as provided by law.
      (2)   Notices and orders.
         A.   Notice to owner or to person or persons responsible.  Whenever
the inspecting official determines that there has been a violation of this
regulation or has grounds to believe that a violation has occurred, notice
shall be given to the owner or the person or persons responsible therefore in
the manner prescribed herein.
      (3)   Unsafe structures and equipment.
         A.   General.  When a structure or equipment is found by the
inspecting official to be unsafe, or when a structure is found unfit for human
occupancy, or is found unlawful, such structure shall be condemned pursuant to
the provisions of this regulation.
            1.   Unsafe structure.  An unsafe structure is one that is found to
be dangerous to the life, health, property or safety of the public or the
occupants of the structure by not providing minimum safeguards to protect or
warn occupants in the event of fire, or because such structure contains unsafe
equipment or is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe, or of
such faulty construction or unstable foundation, that partial or complete
collapse is likely.
            2.   Unsafe equipment.  Unsafe equipment includes any boiler,
heating equipment, elevator, moving stairway, electrical wiring or device,
flammable liquid containers or other equipment on the premises or within the
structure which is in such disrepair or condition that such equipment is a
hazard to life, health, property or safety of the public or occupants of the
premises or structure.
            3.   Structure unfit for human occupancy.  A structure is unfit for
human occupancy whenever the inspecting official finds that such structure is
unsafe, unlawful, or, because of the degree to which the structure is in
disrepair or lacks maintenance, is unsanitary, vermin or rat infested, contains
filth and contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary or
heating facilities or other essential equipment required by this regulation, or
because the location of the structure constitutes a hazard to the occupants of
the structure or to the public.
            4.   Unlawful structure.  An unlawful structure is one found in
whole or in part to be occupied by more persons than permitted under this
regulation, or was erected, altered or occupied contrary to law.
         B.   Closing of vacant structures.  If the structure is vacant and
unfit for human habitation and occupancy, and is not in danger of structural
collapse, the inspecting official is authorized to post a placard of
condemnation on the premises and order the structure closed up so as not to be
an attractive nuisance. Upon failure of the owner to close up the premises
within the time specified in the order, the inspecting official shall cause the
premises to be closed through any available public agency or by contract or
arrangement by private persons and the cost thereof shall be assessed against
the real estate upon which the structure is located and shall be a lien upon
such real estate.
         C.   Notice.  Whenever the inspecting official has condemned a
structure or equipment under the provisions of this section, notice shall be
posted in a conspicuous place in or about the structure affected by such notice
and served on the owner or the person or persons responsible for the structure
or equipment in accordance with Section
1482.04. The notice shall be in the form prescribed in Section
1482.06.
      (4)   Emergency measures.
         A.   Imminent danger.  When, in the opinion of the inspecting
official, there is imminent danger of failure or collapse of a building or
structure which endangers life, or when any structure or part of a structure
has fallen and life is endangered by the occupation of the structure, or when
there is actual or potential danger to the building occupants or those in the
proximity of any structure because of explosives, explosive fumes or vapors or
the presence of toxic fumes, gases or materials, or operation of defective or
dangerous equipment, the inspecting official is hereby authorized and empowered
to order and require the occupants to vacate the premises forthwith. The
inspecting official shall cause to be posted at not less than one entrance to
such structure a notice reading as follows: "This Structure is Unsafe and its
Occupancy has been Prohibited by the Inspecting Official." It shall be unlawful
for any person to enter such structure except for the purpose of securing the
structure, making the required repairs, removing the hazardous condition, or of
demolishing the same.
         B.   Temporary safeguards.  Notwithstanding other provisions of this
regulation, whenever, in the opinion of the inspecting official, there is
imminent danger due to an unsafe condition, the inspecting official shall order
the necessary work to be done, including the boarding-up of openings, to render
such structure temporarily safe whether or not the legal procedure herein
described has been instituted; and shall cause such other action to be taken as
the inspecting official deems necessary to meet such emergency.
         C.   Closing streets.  When necessary for the public safety, the
inspecting official shall temporarily close structures and close, or order the
authority having jurisdiction to close, sidewalks, streets, public ways and
places adjacent to unsafe structures, and prohibit the same from being
utilized.
         D.   Emergency repairs.  For the purpose of this section, the
inspecting official shall employ the necessary labor and materials to perform
the required work as expeditiously as possible.
         E.   Costs of emergency repairs.  Costs and expenses incurred in the
performance of emergency work shall be paid expended upon authorization of the
inspecting official. The Law Director shall undertake appropriate collection
action against the owner of the premises where the unsafe structure is or was
located for the recovery of such costs and expenses.
      (5)   Demolition.
         A.   General.  The inspecting official shall order the owner of any
premises upon which is located any structure, which in the inspecting
official's judgment is so old, dilapidated or has become so out of repair as to
be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human habitation or
occupancy, and such that it is unreasonable to repair the structure, to raze
and remove such structure; or if such structure is capable of being made safe
by repairs, to repair and make safe and sanitary or to raze and remove at the
owner's option; or where there has been a cessation of normal construction of
any structure for a period of more than two years, to raze and remove such
structure.
         B.   Order. All notices and orders shall comply with Section
1482.06.
         C.   Failure to comply.  If the owner of a premises fails to comply
with a demolition order within the time prescribed, the inspecting official
shall cause the structure to be razed and removed, either through an available
public agency or by contract or arrangement with private persons, and the cost
of such razing and removal shall be charged against the real estate upon which
the structure is located and shall be a lien upon such real estate.
         D.   Salvage materials.  When any structure has been ordered razed and
removed, the inspecting official shall have the right to sell the salvage and
valuable materials at the highest price obtainable, pursuant to applicable Ohio
law.  The net proceeds of such sale, after deducting the expenses of such
razing and removal, shall be promptly remitted with a report of such sale or
transaction, including the items of expense and the amounts deducted, for the
person who is entitled thereto, subject to any order of a court.  If such a
surplus does not remain to be turned over, the report shall so state.

APPEALS AND VARIANCES
Section 6.01 Appeals
Appeals to the Planning and Zoning Commission concerning
interpretation or administration of this Ordinance may be taken by any owner of
property with a substantial interest in the matter who is adversely affected, or by
a governmental officer, department, Commission, or bureau. Such appeal shall
be taken within twenty (20) days after the date of the decision, by filing with the
Zoning Enforcement Officer or with the Planning and Zoning Commission a
notice of appeal specifying the decision of the Zoning Enforcement Officer from
which the appeal is being taken.
Section 6.02 Variances
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have the power to authorize,
upon appeal in specific cases, filed as hereinafter provided, such variances from
the provisions or requirements of the Ordinance as will not be contrary to the
public interest. Such variances shall be granted only in cases of exceptional
conditions, involving irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots, or other
exceptional physical conditions of the land, whereby strict application of such
provisions or requirements would result in practical difficulty and unnecessary
hardship that would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land and
buildings involved. No variance from strict application of any provision of this
Ordinance shall be granted by the Commission unless it finds that all the
following facts and conditions exist:
A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot
size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions specific to the land or building for
which the variance is sought, and such conditions do not
apply generally to land or building in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located.
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the
property.
C. That such unreasonable and unnecessary hardship has not
been created by the appellant.
D. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair
the appropriate use or development of adjacent property,
nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
2-14
E. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the
minimum variance that will afford relief and will represent
the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.
Under no circumstances shall the Planning and Zoning Commission grant an
appeal or variance that would allow a use not permissable under this Ordinance
in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the
terms of this Ordinance in said district.
Section 6.03 Application for Variance and Appeals
Any person owning or having an interest in property, after being denied a
zoning permit, may file an application to obtain a variance or appeal from the

violation of this Ordinance and punishable under Section 3.11 of this
Ordinance.
2-15
Section 6.05 Public Hearing by the Commission
The Commission shall hold a public hearing for consideration of an appeal
from a decision of the Zoning Enforcement Officer or variance unless a

Before holding the public hearing pursuant to Section 6.05, notice of such
hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers of general circulation in

supplementary conditions as specified in Section 6.04, or disapprove the
request for appeal or variance. If the application is approved, or approved with
supplementary conditions, the Commission shall make a finding that the
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance that will
make possible a reasonable use of the land, building or structure. If the request
for appeal or variance is denied, the reasons for such denial shall be noted in
writing. The Commission shall transmit a written copy of its decision and
findings to the Zoning Enforcement Officer, who shall forward such copy to the
applicant by first class mail, or in person.

Commission by the aggrieved party within seven (7) days from the date of
filing of the appeal.

B.
c.
D.
E.
F.
Section 7 .04
The use is in fact a conditional use as established under the
district regulations.

maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate with
the existing or intended character of the general vicinity

adjacent uses.
The use will be served adequately by essential public
facilities and services such as highways, streets, police and
fire protection, drainage structures, refuse disposal, water

Zoning Ordinance.
Supplementary Conditions

NONCONFORMITIES
Section 8.01 Intent
Within the districts established by this Ordinance, or amendments
hereinafter adopted, there may exist lots, structures, uses of land and structure
which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended, but which
would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or
future amendments. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed and to permit reasonable
extensions as allowed by law.

Section 8.03
When Permitted
Existing Land or Buildings
Any use of land or buildings existing on the effective date
of this Ordinance may be continued, even though such use
does not conform to the provisions herein, so long as such
use was in conformity with the zoning ordinance in effect
in the Municipality at the time that the use or structure was
established. No nonconforming building, structure, or use
shall be moved, extended, enlarged, reconstructed, or
structurally altered, except as specifically provided in this
Ordinance.
Construction Commenced
Any property purchased or acquired in good faith for any
nonconforming use prior to the adoption of this Ordinance,
upon which property the work of changing, remodeling or
construction of such nonconforming use has been legally
commenced at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, may
be used for the nonconforming use for which such
changing, remodeling or construction was undertaken,
provided that such work is completed within two (2) years
from the date of adoption of this Ordinance or amendment
thereto making said use nonconforming.
Substitution
The Planning and Zoning Commission may allow the nonconforming use
of a building or structure to be changed to another nonconforming use of the
same or of a more restricted classification, provided no structural alterations
except those required by law or ordinance are made. No additional signs or
sign area intended to be viewed from off the premises shall be allowed for any
nonconforming business use existing in a district where single-family homes
are a permitted use.

structurally altered, except as follows:
A.
B.

building containing a nonconforming use to be enlarged to
an extent not exceeding fifty percent (50%) of the ground
floor area of the existing building or structure devoted to a
nonconforming use at the time of enactment of this
Ordinance or at the time of its amendment making the use
nonconforming. The Commission, except under
conditions of a variance pursuant to Article VI above,
shall not authorize an extension which would result in a
violation of the provision of this Ordinance with respect to
any adjoining premises, or which would occupy ground
space required for meeting the yard or other requirements
of this Ordinance.
No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in
whole or in part to any other location unless such building
or structure and the yard and other open spaces provided
are made to conform to all of the regulations of the district
in which such building or structure is to be located.
Any residential structure which is nonconforming due to
the fact of its being in a non-residential zoning district may
be enlarged, extended, reconstructed or structurally altered
provided it meets the requirements of the adjacent or most
proximate R-District.
Any structure which is nonconforming due to its location
or configuration on the lot, resulting in lot coverage or
yards inconsistent with the requirements of the zoning
district where it is located, may be enlarged, extended or
structurally altered in a manner that decreases or maintains
its existing degree of nonconformity, but in no case shall
such structure be enlarged, extended or structurally altered
in a manner that increases its degree of nonconformity.
Discontinuance
A nonconforming use which has been abandoned shall not thereafter be
returned to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall be considered
abandoned whenever any one of the following conditions exist:
A. When the use has been voluntarily discontinued for a
period of two (2) years.
B. When the nonconforming use has been replaced by a
conforming use.
2-21
Section 8.06 Damage and/or Destruction of a Nonconforming
Building or Use
When a building or structure, the use of which does not conform to the
provisions of this Ordinance, is damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or the
public enemy, it may be restored or rebuilt and continued in such
nonconforming use, provided that the restoration or rebuilding is commenced
within six (6) months of the time of damage, that construction is completed
within one (1) year, and that such restoration or rebuilding would not extend or
expand the existing use. If the restoration or rebuilding of the structure
involves extension or expansion of the use, then the provisions of Section 8.04
shall apply.
Section 8.07 Maintenance and Repair
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance
and repair of a building or structure containing a nonconforming use. Structural
alterations may be made to a building or structure containing a nonconforming
use as follows:
A .
B.
C.
Section 8.08
When required by law.
To convert to a conforming use.
A building or structure containing residential
nonconforming uses may be so altered as to improve
interior livability. However, no structural alterations shall
be made which exceed the area or height requirements or
which would extend into any yard required in the district in
which such building is located.
Nonconforming Lots of Record
In any district where dwellings are permitted, a one-family detached
dwelling or accessory building if the lot is already occupied by a one-family
residence, may be erected on any lot of official record on the effective date of
this Ordinance, even though such lot does not comply with the lot area and
width requirements of the district in which it is located, provided said lot has
minimum area of 3,000 square feet and at least twenty-five (25) feet of lot width
with frontage on a public street; and further provided the following conditions
are complied with:
A. If the owner of such lot does not own adjacent property
and did not own adjacent property at the time this
Ordinance became effective:
1. In any district where dwellings are permitted, two
(2) inches may be deducted from the required
minimum width of each side yard and four (4)
inches from the required minimum width of both
side yards for each foot that the lot is narrower than
the required width for the district. In no case,
however, shall any side yard be narrower than
three (3) feet.
2-22
2. For lots having a depth of less than 110 feet, the
depth of the rear yard need not exceed 25 percent
of the total depth of the lot, but shall not be less
than twenty (20) feet.
B. If the owner of such lot owns adjacent property, or owned
such property at the time th.i3 Ordinance became effective,
the modification of lot area and yard dimensions as set
forth hereinbefore shall not apply, except as follows: In
order to erect a dwelling or dwellings thereon, the owner
of two (2) or more adjacent lots fronting on the same street
shall redivide the lots in such a manner that they conform
with the lot area and yard requirements for a single-family
dwelling in that district where the lots are located.
However, if the average width of the lots resulting from
such redivision would exceed the required lot width for a
single family dwelling by more than fifteen (15) feet, such
redivision, if any, may be made so as to provide one (1)
more building lot than would otherwise be permitted. In
such case, the provisions of Section 8.08A. relating to the
reduction of side and rear yards shall apply.

Listed uses are to be defined by their customary name or
identification, except as specifically defined or limited in this
Ordinance.
10.02.02 Permitted Uses
A. Only a use designated as permitted shall be allowed as· a
matter of right in any zoning district, and any use not so
designated shall be prohibited unless:
1. A permitted use may be added to a zoning district
by formal amendment, in conformance with Article
V of this Ordinance.
2. An unlisted use may be determined by the Planning
and Zoning Commission to be a similar use,
pursuant to Sections 10.02.05 of this Article.
B. In no case shall there be more than one (1) principal
building used for single-family residential purposes on
any individual zoning lot.

clearly incidental and secondary to the principal permitted
building or use, and located on the same lot with such
principal building or use. Accessory uses or structures shall
be allowed in accordance with the specific district regulations,
and the requirements of Article XXXII of this Ordinance.
10.02.04 Conditional Uses
A use designated as a conditional use shall be allowed in the

10.02.05
To this end, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall, in
addition to the development standards for the specific district,
set forth additional requirements as will render the conditional
use compatible with existing and future use of adjacent lots in
the vicinity, in accordance with Article V of this Ordinance.
Similar Uses
Determination as to whether a use is similar to uses permitted
by right shall be considered as an expansion of use regulations
of the district and not as a variance applying to a particular
situation. An use found similar shall thereafter be considered
as a permitted use in that district.
Applications for zoning permits for uses not specifically listed
in the permitted building or use classifications of the zoning
district, which the applicant feels qualify as a similar use under
the provisions of this Section, shall be submitted to
Planning and Zoning Commission.
Within sixty (60) days after such submittal, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall determine whether the requested use
is similar to those uses permitted in the specific district. In

no offensive noise, vibration, dust, hear, smoke, odor,
glare, or other objectionable influences, and does not
create traffic congestion to an extent greater than
normally resulting from uses listed in the classification to
which it is to be added.

for uses permitted in that district. If development standards
are in conflict with requirements of any other lawfully adopted
rule, regulation, or law, the most restrictive standard shall
govern.

For particular uses in specific districts, a Development Plan
will be cited as required. In such cases, the Development Plan
shall be submitted by the applicant at the time of the application
for a zoning permit. The Development Plan shall contain a site
plan for the property, drawn to approximate scale, showing all
3-2
property lines and building outlines, access drives, parking
areas, and other notable physical features. The Development
Plan shall also show the size, design, materials and location of
all signage proposed for the development. The Development
Plan shall contain a narrative description of the proposed use,
and how such use will impact adjacent residential property.

This District provides for residential developments containing a
mixture of single and multiple family use, at a variety of housing
densities.
3-48
Section 27 .03 Definition
"Planned Unit Development'', or PUD, shall mean an area of land in
which a variety of housing types and subordinate commercial facilities are
accommodated in a planned environment under more flexible standards, such as
lot sizes and setbacks, than those restrictions that would normally apply under
these regulations. The approval cf such development contains requirements in
addition to those of the standard zoning districts, such as building design
principles, and landscaping plans.
Section 27.04 Permitted and Conditional Uses
Permitted uses within the SR, AR, MH-R, NB, LIC and SU Districts
may be combined in the PUD District, provided that the proposed location of
non-residential uses are compatible with the design of the overall tract, will not
adversely impact adjacent property, and that the location of such uses are
specified in the preliminary and final development plans. Permitted uses within
the SR and AR Districts may be combined in the PUD-R District.
The amount of land devoted to non-residential uses in a planned unit
development combining residential and non-residential components shall require
approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
Section 27.05 Project Area
The gross area of a tract of land proposed to be developed in a single PUD
or PUD-R District shall be a minimum of ten (10) acres. This requirement may
be waived by the Planning and Zoning Commission if all property abutting the
subject tract is platted and/or developed.
Section 27 .06 Common Open Space
A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the gross land area developed in
any planned unit development project shall be reserved for common open space
and/or recreational facilities. Such common open space shall be:
A. dedicated to a homeowner's association who shall have title to the
land which shall be retained as common open space. The legal

and egress points, in order to reduce traffic congestion and mitigate potential
conflict points. Planting screens or fences shall be provided on the perimeter of
the such areas where they are adjacent to residential areas. Parking areas shall
be designed so as to discourage single, large, unbroken paved lots, and shall
encourage smaller defined parking areas within the total parking system. Such
defined parking areas should be delineated and accented by landscaped areas.

such other features and facilities as may be necessary to make the project
attractive and efficient from the standpoint of the adjoining and surrounding
areas.
Section 27.09 Residential Density
The City of Greenville is prepared to accept a higher density in
undeveloped areas than that reflected by current zoning, provided the developer
can utilize planned unit development techniques to demonstrate that any
increment of public cost clearly attributable to increased densities will be
compensated for by the private amenities and public benefits to be achieved by
the plan of development.
The maximum density of the residential portions of the entire planned unit
development shall not exceed ten (10) dwelling units per acre. The calculation
of such density shall be based on the number of proposed dwelling units
divided by the area of the site designated for residential use, excluding streets
and common areas.

including but not limited to, building height, massing and proportion,
roof shape and slope, landscaping design and plant materials,
lighting, vehicular and pedestrian circulation and signage.
B. The distinguishing original qualities or character of a historic building,
structure, site and/or its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural or environment features should be avoided when
possible.
C. All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of
their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which
seek to create an earlier appearance inconsistent or inappropriate to
the original integrity of the building shall be discouraged.
D. Whereas changes which may have taken place in the course of time
are evidence of the history and development of a building structure or
site and its environment, if these changes are deemed to have
acquired significance, then this significance shall be recognized and
respected.
E. Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
F. Significant architectural features which have deteriorated shall be
repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event
replacement is necessary, the new material should match the
material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and
other visual qualities. Repair or placement of architectural features
should be based on accurate duplication of the feature, and if
possible, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence
