adjoining property, applicable building and code requirements and such
other issues that may be appropriate based on the facts presented. The

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
§ 210-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1, et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and Council of the Borough of
Edgewater of Bergen County, New Jersey does ordain as follows.
§ 210-2. Findings of fact.
§ 210-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. The flood hazard areas of the Borough of Edgewater are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
§ 204-24 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 210-3

§ 210-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
§ 210-5. Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common
usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
AH ZONE  Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one
and three feet. Base flood elevations (BFEs) derived from detailed hydraulic
analyses are shown in this zone.
AO ZONE  Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet.
APPEAL  A request for a review of the Construction Official interpretation
of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO or AH Zone on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map with a 1% annual or greater chance
of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined
channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by
ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  Land in the floodplain within a
community subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE)  The flood elevation shown on a
published Flood Insurance Study (FIS) including the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM). For Zones AE, AH, AO, and A1-30 the elevation represents
the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a 1% or greater
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. For Zones VE and
V1-30 the elevation represents the stillwater elevation (SWEL) plus wave
effect (BFE = SWEL + wave effect) resulting from a flood that has a 1% or
greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

portion of the building or supporting foundation system.
COASTAL A ZONE  The portion of the special flood hazard area (SFHA)
starting from a Velocity (V) Zone and extending up to the landward limit
of the moderate wave action delineation. Where no V Zone is mapped, the
Coastal A Zone is the portion between the open coast and the landward limit
of the moderate wave action delineation. Coastal A Zones may be subject to
wave effects, velocity flows, erosion, scour, or a combination of these forces.
Construction and development in Coastal A Zones is to be regulated the
same as V Zones/coastal high hazard areas.
COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREA  An area of special flood hazard
extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along
an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from
storms or seismic sources.

storage of equipment or materials located within the area of special flood
hazard.
ELEVATED BUILDING  A nonbasement building built, in the case of a
building in an area of special flood hazard, to have the top of the elevated
floor or, in the case of a building in a coastal high-hazard area or Coastal
A Zone, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of
the elevated floor, elevated above the base flood elevation plus freeboard
by means of piling, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the
flow of the water, and adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural
integrity of the building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base
flood. In an area of special flood hazard "elevated building" also includes a
building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with
openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In
areas of coastal high hazard and Coastal A Zones "elevated building" also
includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building"
even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls.
EROSION  The process of gradual wearing away of land masses.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION  A
manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to

In all areas of special flood hazards, compliance with the applicable
requirements of the Uniform Construction Code (N.J.A.C. 5:23) and the
following standards, whichever is more restrictive, is required:
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing § 210-15D(1) through
(11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as
a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
C. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
D. Variances shall only be issued upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public as identified in § 210-15D, or conflict
with existing local laws or ordinances.
E. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
A. Anchoring.
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure.
(2) All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement.

impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
and
(4) For all new construction and substantial improvements the
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding.
D. Subdivision proposals.
(1) All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development
shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
(2) All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development
shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize
flood damage;
(3) All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
damage; and
(4) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed new development which contain at
least 50 lots or five acres (whichever is less).
E. Enclosure openings. All new construction and substantial
improvements having fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that
are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in
an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall

of the Borough in adopting this chapter to organize and codify all such
powers of land use management into one comprehensive cohesive
system in order to facilitate the administration of land use procedure,
while providing maximum protection of the public health, safety and
general welfare in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-2
et seq.

(1) Encourage action to guide the appropriate use or development of
all lands in the Borough of Edgewater in a manner which will
promote the public health, safety, morals and general welfare.
(2) Secure safety from fire, flood, panic and other natural and manmade
disasters.
(3) Provide adequate light, air and open space.

concentrations that will contribute to the well-being of persons,
neighborhoods and the entire municipality as well as the
preservation of the environment.
(6) Encourage the appropriate and efficient expenditure of public
funds by the coordination of public development with land use
policies.

member unless there be amongst the Class IV or alternate members
both a member of the Zoning Board or Historic Preservation

the expiration of such terms shall be distributed evenly over the first
four years after their appointment, as determined by resolution of the
governing body; provided, however, that no term of any member shall
exceed four years, and further provided that nothing herein shall affect
the terms of any present members of the Planning Board, all of whom

on a matter due to the member's personal or financial interests therein,

proceedings but may not vote except in the absence or disqualification
of a regular member of any class. A vote shall not be delayed in order

subdivision of more than 10 lots, the Planning Board shall grant or deny

to carry into effect the provisions and purposes of this chapter. In the

to:
(1) Hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that
there is error in any order, requirement, decision or refusal made
§ 240-21 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-26
1:332
by an administrative official or agency based on or made in the
enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance.
(2) Hear and decide requests for interpretation of the Zoning Map97 or
Zoning Ordinance or for decisions upon other special questions
upon which such Board is authorized by the Zoning Ordinance to
pass.
(3) Granting of variances.
(a) Where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or
shape of a specific piece of property, or by reason of
exceptional topographic conditions, or by reason of other
extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such
piece of property, the strict application of any regulation in the
Zoning Ordinance would result in peculiar and exceptional
practical difficulties to or exceptional and undue hardship upon
the owner of such property, a variance from such strict
application may be granted, so as to relieve such difficulties or
hardship; provided, however, that no variance shall be granted
under this subsection to allow a structure or use in a district
restricted against such structure or use, and further provided
that the proposed development does not require approval by
the Planning Board of a subdivision, site plan or conditional
use approval.
(b) In particular cases and for special reasons, grant a variance to
allow a principal use or structure in a district restricted against
such use or principal structure; an expansion of a
nonconforming use; a deviation from a specification or
standard pertaining solely to a conditional use; an increase in
the permitted floor area ratio; an increase in the permitted
density, except as applied to the required lot area for a lot or
lots for detached one- or two-family dwelling unit buildings,
which lot or lots are either an isolated undeveloped sized lot or
lots resulting from a minor subdivision; or a height of a
principal structure which exceeds by 10 feet or 10% the
maximum height permitted in the district for a principal
structure, but only by the affirmative vote of five members of
the Board.
B. No variance or other relief may be granted under the provisions of this
section unless such variance or other relief can be granted without
substantial detriment to the public good and will not substantially
impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and the Zoning
Ordinance. Any application under any subsection of this section may be
referred to any appropriate person or agency, including the Planning
Board, for its report, provided that such reference shall not extend the
period of time within which the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall act.

voucher an opportunity to be heard concerning the reasonableness
of said voucher.
(5) If no hearing is requested as outlined above, or if the Borough
agency finds in favor of the professional, payment shall be made
pursuant to the voucher.
(6) If approved by the Borough agency, the voucher shall be directed to
the Borough Finance Director for reimbursement to the
professional for services rendered.
A. Before execution of the final subdivision plat, as a condition of final site
plan approval, or as a condition to the granting of a development
approval pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq., the applicant shall have
§ 240-47 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-48
1:349
installed all improvements required by the Planning Board, except
that the Borough Council may require and shall accept in accordance
with the standards adopted herein for the purpose of assuring the
installation and maintenance of on-tract improvements the following:
(1) The furnishing of a performance guarantee in favor of the Borough
in an amount not to exceed 120% of the cost of installation for all
improvements not installed prior to final approval.
(2) A maximum of 10% of the total guarantee required shall be in cash.
All of the improvements shall be subject to inspection and approval
by the Borough Engineer, who shall be notified by the developer at
least 48 hours prior to the start of the construction. No
underground installations shall be covered until inspected and
approved.
B. Provision for a maintenance guarantee to be posted with the Borough
Council for a period not to exceed two years after final acceptance of
the improvements, in an amount not to exceed 15% of the cost of the
improvement.
C. The time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the
performance guarantee has been provided may be extended by the
Borough Council by resolution. As a condition or as part of any such
extension, the amount of any performance guarantee shall be increased
or reduced, as the case may be, to an amount not to exceed 120% of the
cost of installation, as determined as of the time of the passage of the
resolution.
D. If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guarantee, the obligor and surety, if
any, shall be liable thereon to the Borough for the reasonable cost of the
improvements not completed or corrected, and the Borough may either
prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof complete such
improvements.
E. Incomplete or unsatisfactory improvements.
(1) Upon substantial completion of all required street improvements
(except for the top course) and appurtenant utility improvements
and the connection of same to the public system, the obligor may
request of the Borough Council, in writing, by certified mail, that
the Borough Engineer prepare, in accordance with the itemized
cost estimate prepared by the Borough Engineer and appended to
the performance guarantee pursuant to Subsection A of this section
a list of all uncompleted or unsatisfactory completed
improvements. A copy of the request shall be sent to the Borough
Engineer. The request shall indicate which improvements have
been completed and which improvements remain uncompleted in
the judgment of the obligor. Thereupon the Borough Engineer shall
inspect all improvements covered by the request and shall file a
written list and report with the Borough Council, with a copy to the
§ 240-48 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-48
1:350
obligor, not later than 45 days after the receipt of the obligor's
request.
(2) The list prepared by the Borough Engineer shall state, in detail,
with respect to each improvement determined to be incomplete or
unsatisfactory, the nature and extent of the incompleteness of each
incomplete improvement or the nature and extent of, and remedy
for, the unsatisfactory state of each completed improvement
determined to be unsatisfactory, or the nature and extent of, and
remedy for, the unsatisfactory state of each completed
improvement determined to be unsatisfactory. The report shall also
identify each improvement determined to be complete and
satisfactory together with a recommendation as to the amount of
reduction to be made in the performance guarantee relating to the
completed and satisfactory improvement, in accordance with the
itemized cost estimate prepared by the Borough Engineer and
appended to the performance guarantee pursuant to Subsection A
of this section.
F. Reduction in performance guarantee.
(1) The Borough Council, by resolution, shall either approve the
improvements determined to be complete and satisfactory by the
Borough Engineer, or reject any or all of these improvements and
shall approve and authorize the amount of reduction to be made in
the performance guarantee relating to the improvements accepted,
in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the
Borough Engineer. This resolution shall be adopted not later than
45 days after receipt of the list and report prepared by the Borough
Engineer. Upon adoption of the resolution by the Borough Council,
the obligor shall be released from all liability pursuant to its
performance guarantee, with respect to those approved
improvements, except for that portion adequately sufficient to
secure completion or correction of the improvements not yet
approved, provided that 30% of the amount of the performance
guarantee posted may be retained to ensure completion and
acceptability of all improvements.
(2) In the event that the obligor has made a cash deposit with the
Borough or approving authority as part of the performance
guarantee, then any partial reduction granted in the performance
guarantee pursuant to this subsection shall be applied to the case
deposit in the same proportion as the original cash deposit bears to
the full amount of the performance guarantee.
G. If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the approving
authority may require the obligor to complete or correct such
improvements and, upon completion or correction, the same procedure
of notification, as set forth in this section, shall be followed.
§ 240-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-48
1:351
H. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the
obligor to contest by legal proceedings any determination or lack of a
determination of the Borough Council or the Borough Engineer.
I. The obligor shall reimburse the Borough for all reasonable inspection
fees paid to the Borough Engineer for the foregoing inspection of
improvements; provided that the Borough may require of the developer
a deposit for the inspection fees in an amount not to exceed, except for
extraordinary circumstances, the greater of $500 or 5% of the cost of
improvements, which cost shall be determined pursuant to Section 15
of P.L. 1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4). For those developments for
which the reasonably anticipated fees are less than $10,000, fees may,
at the option of the developer, be paid in two installments. The initial
amount deposited by a developer shall be 50% of the reasonably
anticipated fees. When the balance on deposit drops to 10% of the
reasonably anticipated fees because the amount deposited by the
developer has been reduced by the amount paid to the Borough
Engineer for inspection, the developer shall deposit the remaining 50%
of the anticipated inspection fees. For those developments for which the
reasonably anticipated fees are $10,000 or greater, fees may, at the
option of the developer, be paid in four installments. The initial amount
deposited by a developer shall be 25% of the reasonably anticipated
fees. When the balance on deposit drops to 10% of the reasonably
anticipated fees because the amount deposited by the developer has
been reduced by the amount paid to the Borough Engineer for
inspection, the developer shall make additional deposits of 25% of the
reasonably anticipated fees. The Borough Engineer shall not perform
any inspection if sufficient funds to pay for those inspections are not on
deposit.
J. In the event that final approval is by stages or sections of development
pursuant to Subsection A of Section 29 of P.L. 1975, c. 291 (N.J.S.A.
40:55D-38), the provisions of this section shall be applied by stage or
section.
K. To the extent that any of the improvements have been dedicated to the
Borough on the subdivision plat or site plan, the Borough Council shall
be deemed, upon the release of any performance guarantee required
pursuant to Subsection A of this section, to accept dedication for public
use of streets or roads and any other improvements made thereon
according to site plans and subdivision plats approved by the approving
authority, provided that such improvements have been inspected and
have received final approval by the Borough Engineer.
L. Building permits in a subdivision or site plan or approved subsection
thereof, except for model buildings in the first subsection, will be issued
only when all improvements, with the exception of the following, shall
have been installed to serve all lots and structures within the
subdivision or site plan or approved subsection thereof and approved by
the Borough Engineer:
§ 240-48 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-48
1:352
§ 240-49. Developer's agreement.
§ 240-50. Off-tract improvements other than sanitary sewer and
water improvements.
(1) The final bituminous surface course of streets;
(2) Street signs;
(3) Dry wells and swales as may be required;
(4) Monuments;
(5) Shade trees;
(6) Sidewalks; and
(7) In the case of site plans only, landscaping.
M. Permits for model buildings in the front subsection or 10% of the total
number to be built in said subsection, whichever is less, not to exceed
six, may be issued on commencement of construction of improvements.
N. Installation of sidewalks and/or walkways on a lot shall be completed
prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for that lot.
O. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, upon
completion of all improvements but prior to acceptance by the Borough
Council of such improvements and prior to the release of any
performance guarantee which may have been posted, deeds must be
received, free and clear of all mortgages and encumbrances, for all fee
and other property interests and improvements to be conveyed to the
Borough.
P. A site plan bond shall be posted prior to earth disturbance.
A. Within 60 days of the adoption of a resolution granting either final
subdivision approval or final site plan approval and prior to the
execution of the final subdivision plat, there shall be an agreement
submitted to the Zoning Officer by the approving board attorney.
B. The Zoning Officer then distributes copies of the agreement to the
Mayor and Council, board members, board professional experts,
developer and any other agency deemed necessary.
C. All comments from the individuals listed above shall be submitted to the
approving board attorney prior to the next scheduled board meeting.
After review by the board, the board forwards its comments to the
Mayor and Council.
D. The agreement shall be executed by the Mayor and Council and then
forwarded to the county to be filed.
§ 240-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-50
1:353
A. Pursuant to the powers established in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-42, the following
standards are hereby promulgated with respect to determining the
proportionate or pro rata share of an applicant for a required off-tract
improvement. Prior to the granting of final approval of a site plan or
subdivision, the applicant shall have installed or made cash payments in
the manner provided for below with respect to the immediate or
ultimate installation of any required off-tract improvement:
(1) Allocation of costs; criteria in determining allocation. The
allocation or costs for off-tract improvements as between the
applicant, other property owners and the Borough, or any one or
more of the foregoing, shall be determined by the Planning Board
with the assistance of the appropriate Borough agencies on the
basis of the total cost of the off-tract improvements, the increase in
market values of property affected and any other benefits
conferred, the needs created by the application, population and
land use projections for the general area of the applicant's property
and other areas to be served by the off-tract improvements, the
estimated time of construction of the off-tract improvements and
the condition and periods of usefulness, which periods may be
based upon the criteria of N.J.S.A. 40A:22-2. The following criteria
may also be considered as well as any other reasonable criteria
which would aid in said determination:
(a) Street, curb, gutter, sidewalk, shade trees, streetlights, street
signs and traffic light improvements may also be based upon
the anticipated increase of traffic generated by the application
and the anticipated benefit thereto.
(b) Drainage facilities may also be based upon or be determined by
the drainage created by or affected by any particular land use,
considering the percentage relationship between the acreage
of the application and the acreage of the total drainage basin;
the use of a particular site and the amount of area to be
covered by impervious surfaces on the site itself; and the use,
condition or status of the remaining area of the drainage basin.
(2) Improvements to be constructed at the sole expense of the
applicant. In cases where reasonable and necessary need for an offtract
improvement or improvements is necessitated or required by
the proposed development application and where no other property
owners receive a special benefit thereby, the Board may require the
applicant, as a condition of approval, at the applicant's expense, to
provide for and construct such improvements as if such were ontract
improvements in the manner provided hereafter and as
otherwise provided by law.
(3) Payment of allocated costs. In the event that the improvement
required shall be constructed as a general or a local improvement,
the estimated cost of the off-tract improvement allocated to the
applicant shall be deposited with the municipality in the form of
§ 240-50 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-50
1:354
cash. Said deposit shall be paid by the subdivider to the Borough
Treasurer, who shall provide a suitable depository therefor, and
such funds shall be used only for the off-tract improvements for
which they are deposited or shall be refunded to the subdivider as
hereinafter set forth.
(4) Deposit of funds. All funds paid by an applicant pursuant to this
chapter shall be used only for the improvements for which they are
deposited or improvements serving the same purpose.
(5) Redetermination of assessment upon completion of improvements.
Upon completion of off-tract improvements required pursuant to
this chapter, the applicant's liability hereunder shall be
recalculated in accordance with the actual as compared with the
estimated cost of the improvements. To the extent that such
recalculation shall increase or decrease the amount of any cash
deposit made by the applicant hereunder, the applicant shall
forthwith either pay the amount of such increase to the
municipality, or the municipality shall forthwith refund the amount
of such decrease to the applicant.
B. Omissions. Omissions from the bond of any improvement will in no way
be construed as to relieve the developer from his legal obligation to
conform to the required improvements as provided for in this chapter.
C. Certification. Prior to the final acceptance of any of the required
improvements by the Borough, the subdivision owner or owners shall
have submitted satisfactory affidavits certifying that no unpaid bills,
liabilities or liens against such improvements and installations are
outstanding.

ARTICLE VI
Development Review Procedures
§ 240-51. General procedures for site plan and subdivision review.
A. Purpose. Such regulations are deemed necessary to achieve the
following purposes.
(1) Promote orderly development: to protect the character and to
maintain the stability of all areas within the community and to
promote the orderly and beneficial development of such areas.
(2) Promulgate rules and regulations: to provide rules, regulations and
procedures, where applicable and to the extent the same have not
been otherwise promulgated by ordinance in the Borough of
Edgewater, which will guide the appropriate development of lands
within the Borough in a manner which will promote the public
health, safety, morals and general welfare.
(3) To protect against hazards and danger: to secure safety from fire,
flood, panic and other natural and man-made disasters.
(4) Design standards: to encourage the design and location of streets
which will promote the free flow of traffic while discouraging the
location of such facilities and routes which will result in congestion.
(5) Creative development techniques: to promote a desirable physical
environment through creative development techniques, design and
arrangement.
(6) Open spaces: to promote the conservation of open space and to
protect the natural resources and to prevent overcrowding through
improper land use.
B. Exceptions to design and performance standards. The approving
authority, when acting upon applications, shall have the power to grant
such exceptions from the subdivision and site plan requirements of this
chapter as may be reasonable and within the general purpose and
intent of the provisions for subdivisions, plat, site plan review and
approval, if the literal enforcement of one or more provisions of this
chapter is impracticable or will exact undue hardship because of
peculiar conditions pertaining to land in question.
C. Submission of concept plan for informal review.
(1) An informal review of a concept plan is optional. At the request of
the developer, the Planning Board shall grant an informal review of
a concept plan for a development for which the developer intends
to prepare and submit an application for development. The purpose
will be to review concepts to assist the applicant in the preparation
of subsequent plans. Other than classification, no decisions will be
made, no hearings held and no formal action taken. Neither the
§ 240-51 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-51
1:357
§ 240-52. Preliminary plats required.
Preliminary plats are required for all site plans and subdivisions.
developer nor the approving authority shall be bound by this
informal review.
(2) Filing procedure and information for concept review.
(a) The developer shall file with the secretary, at least 15 days
prior to the meeting of the approving authority, 16 copies of the
concept plan and five copies of the completed application form.
(b) The concept plan is considered a sketch or general plan neither
fully engineered nor surveyed. Information used to prepare the
concept plan can be available from secondary source
information such as the Soil Conservation Survey Map or
United States Geodetic Survey Maps, but should be sufficiently
detailed to allow the Planning Board to make suggestions on
general site design and layout for circulation, stormwater
management, location of open space and buffers and building
arrangements and to determine how the Land Use Code affects
the proposal.
A. Filing procedure.
(1) The following must be submitted to the office of the Zoning Officer:
16 copies of the application, all plot plans, maps and other papers
required by virtue of any provision of this chapter, as well as the
applicable fee and certification by the Tax Collector that all taxes
are paid to date. The applicant must include envelopes addressed
to the Board professionals, experts and Board members in order to
expedite the mailings.
(2) A corporation or partnership applying for permission to subdivide a
parcel of land or for a site plan or variances shall list the names and
addresses of all stockholders or individual partners owning at least
10% of its stock of any class or at least 10% of the interest in the
partnership, as the case may be. If a corporation or partnership
owns 10% or more of the stock of a corporation, or a ten-percent or
greater interest in a partnership, subject to the above disclosure,
that corporation or partnership shall list the names and addresses
of its stockholders holding 10% or more of its stock or a ten-percent
or greater interest in the partnership, as the case may be, and this
requirement shall be followed by every corporate stockholder or
partner in a partnership until the names and addresses of the
noncorporate stockholders and individual partners exceeding the
ten-percent ownership criterion established in this subsection have
been listed. No Planning Board, Board of Adjustment or municipal
governing body shall approve the application of any corporation or
partnership which does not comply with this requirement of
§ 240-51 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-52
1:358
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-48.1. The penalty for concealment by a corporation
or a partnership shall be as outlined in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-48.1.
(3) Simultaneously with filing the application, copies of the plans shall
be forwarded by the office of the Zoning Officer to the following
persons:
(a) The Borough Engineer.
(b) The planning consultant.
(c) The Fire Prevention Bureau (site plans only).
(d) The Chief of Police and/or Police Director (site plans only).
[Amended 3-20-2017 by Ord. No. 1541-2017]
B. Action by approving authority.
(1) The approving authority shall review the submission for its
completeness and take action on accepting or rejecting the
submission as a complete application. If rejected, the applicant
shall be notified, in writing, within 45 days of submission in
accordance with § 240-14.
(2) Public hearing. If accepted as an application, a public hearing date
shall be set by the approving authority and notice given.
(3) Upon submission of an application, the administrative officer shall
submit one copy of the plat and supporting data to the above
named experts listed in Subsection A(3) for review and action. Each
shall have not more than 30 days from receipt of the plan to report
to the approving authority. In the event of a recommendation of
disapproval, such report shall state the reasons therefor.
(4) The approving authority shall grant or deny preliminary
subdivision approval within the following time periods unless some
further time has been consented to by the developer. Otherwise,
the approving authority shall be deemed to have granted
preliminary approval of the subdivision.
(a) A subdivision of 10 or fewer lots: within 45 days of the date of a
complete submission.
(b) A subdivision with more than 10 lots: within 95 days of the date
of a complete submission.
(5) The approving authority shall grant or deny preliminary site plan
approval within the following time periods unless some further
time has been consented to by the developer. Otherwise, the
approving authority shall be deemed to have granted preliminary
approval of the site plan.

1:359
(b) A site plan which involves more than 10 acres or more than 10
dwelling units: within 95 days of the date of a complete
submission.
(6) If the approving authority required any substantial amendment in
the layout of improvements in either a site plan or subdivision, and
that plan had been the subject of a hearing, an amended
application shall be submitted and proceeded upon as in the case of
the original application for development. The approving authority
shall, if the proposed development complies with this chapter,
grant preliminary approval.
(7) The approving authority may approve, disapprove or approve with
conditions the application. The decision shall be in writing and
shall be sent to the applicant and the newspaper as required by
§ 240-39. If the approving authority grants preliminary approval,
its chairman and secretary, or the vice chairman or assistant
secretary in their absence, respectively, and the Municipal
Engineer shall sign each page of the plat indicating the approval. If
the plat is conditionally approved, it shall not be signed until all
conditions are corrected on the plat. If the corrections are not
completed within 90 days of the conditional approval, the
conditional approval shall lapse, unless the applicant requests an
extension.
(8) Preliminary approval shall confer upon the applicant the following
rights for a three-year period from the date of the preliminary
approval; otherwise the approval shall be void:
(a) That the general terms and conditions on which preliminary
approval was granted shall not be changed, including but not
limited to use requirements; layout and design standards for
streets, curbs and sidewalks; lot size; yard dimensions; offtract
improvements; and any requirements peculiar to site plan
approval, except that nothing herein shall be construed to
prevent the Borough from modifying, by ordinance, such
general terms and conditions of preliminary approval as relate
to public health and safety.
(b) That the applicant may submit for final approval on or before
the expiration date of preliminary approval the whole or a
section or sections of the preliminary plat.
(c) That the applicant may apply for, and the approving authority

additional periods of at least one year but not to exceed a total
extension of two years.
(9) In the case of a development for an area of 50 acres or more, the
approving authority may grant the rights referred to in Subsection
B(8)(a), (b) and (c) above for such period of time longer than three
years as shall be determined by the approving authority to be
§ 240-52 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-52
1:360
§ 240-53. Submission of final subdivision plat.
reasonable taking into consideration the number of dwelling units
and nonresidential floor area permissible under preliminary
approval, the potential number of dwelling units and nonresidential
floor area of the section(s) awaiting final approval, economic
conditions and the comprehensiveness of the development,
provided that, if the design standards have been revised, such
revised standards may govern.
A. Filing procedure.
(1) Prior to the expiration of preliminary plat approval, the developer
shall file with the Zoning Officer, at least 15 days prior to the
meeting of the approving authority, two translucent tracing cloth or
Mylar copies; nine black-on-white paper prints of the plat; two
completed copies of the application form and final plat checklist;
the performance guaranty approved by the governing body,
including off-tract improvements, if any; any maintenance
guaranties; the applicable fee; certification by the Tax Collector
that all taxes are paid to date; certification by the Soil Conservation
District pursuant to the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act,
Chapter 251 of the Laws of 1975 (N.J.S.A. 4-24-39 et seq.) and, if
common open space lot or lots are included in the application, a
separate map showing the individual lot or lots that are to be
designated as common open space, which map shall have shown
thereon the data listed on the Application Checklist in Appendix
A.100
(2) Where utility services are to be extended to the development, the
final plat shall be accompanied by letters directed to the chairman
of the approving authority and signed by a responsible officer of the
water company, sewer authority and utility which provides gas,
telephone and electricity that has jurisdiction in the area. Such
letters shall approve each proposed utility installation design and
state who will construct the facility.
(3) The final plat shall be accompanied by a statement by the
Municipal Engineer that he is in receipt of a map showing all
utilities and other improvements (both in the development and offtract
improvements) in exact location and elevation; that he has
examined the street drainage, erosion, stormwater control and
excavation plans and found that the interests of the Borough and of
nearby properties are fully protected and identifying those portions
of any improvements already installed; and that the developer has
either:
100. Editor's Note: Appendix A is on file in the Borough offices.
§ 240-52 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-53
1:361
(a) Installed all improvements in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter and the preliminary plat approval,
with a maintenance guaranty accompanying the final plat; or
(b) Posted a performance guaranty that has been approved by the
governing body.
B. Action by approving authority of final subdivision plat.
(1) The approving authority shall review the submission for its
completeness and take action on accepting or rejecting the
submission as a complete application. If rejected, the applicant
shall be notified within 45 days of submission. (See § 240-14.) If
accepted as a complete application, the approving authority shall
grant final approval if the detailed drawings, specifications and
estimates conform to the standards established by this chapter, the
conditions of previous reviews, the changes and/or conditions of
previous reviews, the changes and/or conditions required on the
informal plat in cases where there has been no preliminary plat,
and the standards prescribed by the Map Filing Law, N.J.S.A.
46:23-9.9 et seq. In the case of a minor or exempt subdivision or
minor or exempt site plan where there has been no previous
submission of an informal or preliminary plat, the approving
authority may waive the required notices and hearing. In the case
of a planned development, the approving authority may permit
minimal deviations from the conditions of preliminary plat approval
necessitated by a change of conditions beyond the control of the
developer since the date of preliminary approval. Minimal
deviations shall not require the developer to submit another
application for preliminary approval.
(2) Final approval shall be granted or denied within 45 days after
submission of a complete application to the administrative officer
or within such further time as may be consented to by the
applicant. An approved final plat shall be signed by the chairman
and secretary of the approving authority, or the vice chairman or
assistant secretary in their absence, respectively. Failure of the
approving authority to act within the period prescribed shall
constitute final approval, and a certificate of the Zoning Officer as
to the failure of the approving authority to act shall be issued on
request of the applicant. Such certificate shall be sufficient in lieu
of the written endorsement or other evidence of approval herein
required and shall be so accepted by the County Recording Officer
for purposes of filing subdivision plats.
(3) Whenever review or approval of the application by the County
Planning Board is required by N.J.S.A. 40:27-6.3 or 40:27-6.6, the
approving authority shall condition any approval that it grants
upon timely receipt of a favorable report from the County Planning
Board or upon its failure to submit a report within the required
time period.
§ 240-53 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-53
1:362
(4) Final approval of a minor subdivision shall expire 190 days from the
date of municipal approval unless a plat in conformity with such
approval, including any conditions imposed by the approving
authority, and in conformity with the provisions of the Map Filing
Law (N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.), or a deed clearly describing the
approved minor subdivision is filed by the developer with the
County Recording Officer, the Municipal Engineer and the Borough
Tax Assessor. Such plat or deed accepted for such filing shall have
been signed by the chairman and secretary of the approving
authority or the vice chairman or assistant secretary in their
absence, respectively. In reviewing the application for development
for a proposed minor subdivision, the approving authority may
accept a plat not in conformity with the Map Filing Law, provided
that, if the developer chooses to file the minor subdivision by plat
rather than deed, such plat shall conform to the provisions of said
law.
(5) Final approval of a major subdivision shall expire 95 days from the
date of signing of the plat unless within such a period the plat shall
have been duly filed by the developer with the County Recording
Officer. The approving authority may for good cause shown extend
the period for recording for an additional period not to exceed 190
days from the date of the signing of the plat. No subdivision plat
shall be accepted for filing by the County Recording Officer until it
has been approved by the approving authority as indicated on the
instrument by the signature of the chairman and secretary of the
approving authority, or the vice chairman or assistant secretary in
their absence, respectively, or a certificate has been issued as to
the failure of the approving authority to act within the required
time. The signatures of the chairman and secretary shall not be
affixed until the developer has posted the required guaranties. If
the County Recording Officer records any plat without such
approval, such recording shall be deemed null and void, and, upon
request of the municipality, the plat shall be expunged from the
official records. It shall be the duty of the County Recording Officer
to notify the Planning Board, in writing, within seven days of the
filing of any plat, identifying such instrument by its title, date of
filing and official number.
(6) Provided that the approved final subdivision plat has been filed
with the County Recording Officer, the zoning requirements
applicable to the preliminary approval first granted to a site plan or
a major subdivision and all other rights conferred upon the
developer pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law (N.J.S.A.
40:55D-1 et seq.), whether conditionally or otherwise, shall not be
changed for a period of two years after the date of final approval. If
the developer has followed the standards prescribed for final
approval, the approving authority may extend such period of
protection for extensions of one year, but not to exceed three
extensions. Upon granting of final approval, the rights conferred
§ 240-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-53
1:363
§ 240-54. Submission of final site plan.
upon the applicant by the granting of preliminary approval shall be
terminated upon final approval.
(7) Provided that the approved final plat of a minor subdivision has
been filed with the County Recording Officer, the zoning
requirements and general terms and conditions, whether
conditional or otherwise, upon which minor subdivision approval
was granted shall not be changed for a period of two years after the
date of minor subdivision approval.
(8) In the case of a subdivision or site plan for a planned development
of 50 acres or more or a conventional subdivision or site plan of 150
acres or more, the approving authority may grant the rights
referred to in Subsection B(6) and (7) above for such period of time
longer than two years, as shall be determined by the approving
authority to be reasonable, taking into consideration the number of
dwelling units and nonresidential floor area permissible under final
approval, economic conditions and the comprehensiveness of the
development. The developer may apply for and the approving
authority may thereafter grant an extension of final approval for
such additional period of time as shall be determined by the
approving authority to be reasonable taking into consideration the
number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area permissible
under final approval, the number of dwelling units and
nonresidential floor area remaining to be developed, economic
conditions and the comprehensiveness of the development.
(9) The developer shall supply sufficient copies of the approved final
plat so the administrative officer can distribute one copy to each of
the following: Borough Clerk, Construction Official, Tax Assessor,
County Planning Board, Borough Planning Board and any other
agency or person directed by the approving authority and shall
supply one translucent cloth or Mylar copy to the Municipal
Engineer.
A. Filing procedure.
(1) The site plan and an application for final approval shall be
submitted to the Zoning Officer with the required fee. If there have
been no changes in the approved preliminary site plan, the same
plan may be used in connection with the application for final
approval and no further final plan shall be required for approval.
Ten white prints (blue or black-on-white) of the site plan shall
accompany the application. Ten completed copies of the application
form and final plat checklist must be submitted along with the
prints. The performance guaranty approved by the governing body,
including off-tract improvements, if any; any maintenance
guaranties; the applicable fee; certification by the Tax Collector
that all taxes are paid to date; certification by the Soil Conservation

1:364
District pursuant to the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act,
Chapter 251 of the Laws of 1975(N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.).
(2) Where utility services are to be extended to the development, the
final site plan shall be accompanied by letters directed to the
chairman of the approving authority and signed by a responsible
officer of the water company, sewer authority and utility which
provides gas, telephone and electricity that has jurisdiction in the
area. Such letters shall approve each proposed utility installation
design and state who will construct the facility.
(3) The final site plan shall be accompanied by a statement by the
Municipal Engineer that he is in receipt of a map showing all
utilities and other improvements (both in the development and offtract
improvements) in exact location and elevation; that he has
examined the street drainage, erosion, stormwater control and
excavation plans and found that the interests of the Borough and of
nearby properties are fully protected and identifying those portions
of any improvements already installed; and that the developer has
either:
(a) Installed all improvements in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter and the preliminary plat approval,
with a maintenance guaranty accompanying the final plat; or
(b) Posted a performance guaranty that has been approved by the
governing body.
B. Action by approving authority on final site plan.
(1) The approving authority shall review the submission for its
completeness and take action on accepting or rejecting the
submission as a complete application. If rejected, the applicant
shall be notified within 45 days of submission. (See § 240-14.) If
accepted as a complete application, the approving authority shall
grant final approval if the detailed drawings, specifications and
estimates conform to the standards established by this chapter, the
conditions of previous reviews, the changes and/or conditions of
previous reviews, the changes and/or conditions required on the
informal plat in cases where there has been no preliminary plat and
the standards prescribed by the Map Filing Law, N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9
et seq. In the case of a minor or exempt subdivision or minor or
exempt site plan where there has been no previous submission of
an informal or preliminary plat, the approving authority may waive
the required notices and hearing. In the case of a planned
development, the approving authority may permit minimal
deviations from the conditions of preliminary plat approval
necessitated by a change of conditions beyond the control of the
developer since the date of preliminary approval. Minimal
deviations shall not require the developer to submit another
application for preliminary approval.

1:365
§ 240-55. As-built plans; certification of completed improvements.
(2) Final approval shall be granted or denied within 45 days after
submission of a complete application to the administrative officer
or within such further time as may be consented to by the
applicant. An approved final plat shall be signed by the chairman
and secretary of the approving authority, or the vice chairman or
assistant secretary in their absence, respectively. Failure of the
approving authority to act within the period prescribed shall
constitute final approval, and a certificate of the administrative
officer as to the failure of the approving authority to act shall be
issued on request of the applicant. Such certificate shall be
sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or other evidence of
approval herein required and shall be so accepted by the County
Recording Officer for purposes of filing subdivision plats.
(3) The zoning requirements applicable to the preliminary approval
first granted to a site plan and all other rights conferred upon the
developer pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law, whether
conditionally or otherwise, shall not be changed for a period of two
years after the date of final approval. If the developer has followed
the standards prescribed for final approval, the approving authority
may extend such period of protection for extensions of one year, but
not to exceed three extensions. Upon granting of final approval, the
rights conferred upon the applicant by the granting of preliminary
approval shall be terminated upon final approval.
(4) Upon final approval by the approving board, a copy of the plat shall
be filed with each of the following: the Zoning Officer, Engineer of
the Board, Borough Clerk, Construction Official, Borough Planner,
Tax Assessor and any other agency or person directed by the
approving authority.

§ 240-56. General statement.
§ 240-57. Existing permits, approvals and variances.
Nothing in this chapter shall require any changes in a building permit, site
plan or zoning variance which was approved before the enactment of this
chapter, provided that construction shall have been started within one year
from the effective date of this chapter and the project shall be continuously
pursued to completion; otherwise said approvals and permits shall be void.
§ 240-58. Streets.
All developments shall be served by paved streets. The arrangement of
streets not shown on the Master Plan or Official Map shall provide for the
appropriate extension of existing streets, conform to the topography, as far

except when shown at a greater width on the Master Plan or Official
Map of the Borough of Edgewater or when said street constitutes an
extension of an existing street with a greater width than 50 feet.
E. Substandard street right-of-way and pavement width. In connection
with subdivisions that adjoin or include existing streets that do not
conform to widths as shown on the Master Plan or Official Map, or the
street width requirements of this chapter, the applicant shall dedicate
additional right-of-way or pavement width along either one or both
sides of said road. If the subdivision is along one side only, 1/2 of the
required extra width shall be dedicated.
F. Street grades. Grades of arterial and collector streets shall not exceed
6%. Grades on other streets shall not exceed 10%. Maximum grades on
any streets within 100 feet of an intersection shall be 3%. No street
shall have a minimum grade of less than 1/2%. Road cross sections
(crown) shall range between 2% and 3%.
G. Street intersections. No local streets shall be part of a four-way
intersection. Intersecting street center lines shall be as nearly at right
angles as possible, and in no case shall they be less than 60° at the point
of intersection. The block corners at intersections shall be rounded at
the curbline with a curve having a radius of not less than 20 feet.
Curblines shall be parallel to the center line. Approaches to all
intersections shall follow a straight line for at least 100 feet measured
from the curbline of the intersecting streets to the beginning of the
curve. No more than two street center lines shall meet or intersect at
any one point. Collector and/or arterial streets intersecting another
street from opposite sides shall either be directly opposite each other
without offset or shall have at least 250 feet offset distance between
center lines. Street jogs with center-line offsets on local streets of less
than 125 feet shall be prohibited. Any development abutting an existing
street which is classified as an arterial or collector street shall adhere
as closely as possible to having no more than one new street every 800
feet on the same side of the street.
H. Reverse curve tangents. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be
introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
I. Street line deflection. When connecting street lines deflect from each
other at any one point by more than 10° and not more than 45°, they
shall be connected by a curve with a radius of not less than 100 feet, for
minor streets, and 300 feet, for arterial and collector streets.
J. Change in grade. All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical
curves of sufficient degree of curvature to provide a smooth transition
and proper sight distance.
K. Cul-de-sac streets. Cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed a length of 600
feet. A turnaround shall be provided at the end of the cul-de-sac with a
right-of-way radius of not less than 50 feet and a curbline radius of not
less than 40 feet. The center point for the radius shall be on the center

unless, as a result of data submitted prior to the preliminary plat, the
approving authority shall have waived or modified certain portions of
these requirements:
(1) A description of the development specifying what is to be done
during construction and operation, how it is to be done and
practical alternate plans to achieve the objective(s), all with the
intent of minimizing environmental impacts.
(2) An inventory of the following on-site environmental conditions and
an assessment of the probable impact of the development upon
them: water supply; water quality; air quality; geology; soils; rock
and properties thereof, including erosion capabilities and
limitations; floodplain protection; sewage disposal; topography,
including slopes in excess of 15%; vegetation protection; wetlands;
noise characteristics and levels; land use; site aesthetics; and
historic landmarks. Air and water quality shall be described with
reference to standards of the Department of Environmental
Protection of the State of New Jersey, and soils shall be described
with reference to Natural Resources Conservation Service
categories and characteristics as they relate to such things as

(9) Circumstances or conditions that are peculiar to the site or the
application under consideration that are not generally applicable to
sites or applications in the same general locality and that would
result in the imposition of undue burden on the applicant if an
environmental impact report were required.
§ 240-69 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-70
1:377
improvements: street improvements, water system, sewerage, drainage
facilities and easements therefor.
A. Essential off-site and off-tract improvements may be required to be
installed or a performance guaranty furnished in lieu thereof, with the
total cost borne by the developer.
(1) Where a development has no direct access to an improved street or
public or private central water supply or central sanitary sewer and
does not qualify for individual sewage disposal systems, the
approving authority may nevertheless grant final approval if the
developer shall acquire and improve such street between the
development and an existing improved street and, in the case of
water/sewer system(s), if the developer shall acquire and improve
such water and sanitary sewer connections between the
development and existing facilities as approved by the approving
authority, governing body and serving utility company.
(2) Where drainage waters are diverted from the development into
other drainage systems or onto other lands or streets and they are
not adequate to accommodate the additional waters, the approving
authority may grant final approval if the developer shall acquire,
improve and dedicate to the Borough such enlarged, additional or
new drainage facilities as approved by the approving authority and
governing body.
(3) Such off-site and off-tract improvements shall be subject to the
design standards of this chapter. In lieu of the developer
performing such off-site and off-tract work, the developer may
request and the governing body may enter into an agreement for
such work to be performed by the Borough or its contractors at the
cost of the developer.
(4) Where the approving authority determines that off-site and off-tract
improvements are essential to the development and the developer
does not consent to the improvements, the application shall be
denied, without prejudice, to a future application at such time as
the conditions no longer apply.
B. Advisable off-site and off-tract improvements. Where the approving
authority determines that off-site and off-tract improvements would be
advisable, although not essential, and the improvements would promote
the objectives of this chapter and can be most appropriately
accomplished in connection with the development, and particularly
where the off-site and off-tract improvements would be required to be
made as a local improvement by the Borough with the costs thereof to
be assessed against all properties specially benefitted thereby,
including the property of the developer, the following provisions shall
apply:
§ 240-70 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-70
1:378
(1) During the processing of the application, the approving authority
shall refer its recommendations for off-site and off-tract
improvements to the governing body.
(2) If the governing body concurs, the Municipal Engineer or other
authority retained by the Borough shall determine the nature of the
off-site and off-tract improvements, including:
(a) The needs created by the applicant's proposed development.
(b) The then-existing needs in the area notwithstanding any work
of the applicant.
(3) The Municipal Engineer or other authority shall estimate and
report the costs of such work, including all costs to be in any local
improvement ordinance and those to be assessed to the developer,
and including costs for construction, engineering, any easement or
right-of-way acquisition, legal work, advertising, contingencies,
bonding and assessments.
(4) Based upon the above report and the recommendations of the
approving authority, the governing body shall determine whether
to undertake such off-site and off-tract improvements as a local
improvement.
(5) If the governing body will not adopt such ordinance, the final
development shall be designed accordingly, and the approving
authority shall proceed on that basis.
(6) If the determination shall be to adopt such local improvements
ordinance, the governing body shall proceed in the following
manner:
(a) If sufficient funds are available for the initial appropriation, the
governing body may appropriate such funds and adopt such
ordinance. All subsequent proceedings for the making and
assessment of the cost of the off-site and off-tract
improvements shall be in accordance with such ordinance.
(b) If sufficient funds are not available for the initial appropriation,
the governing body may determine the anticipated amount that
the lands of the applicant would be expected to be assessed.
[1] The amount determined by the governing body shall then
be deposited by the applicant with the Borough Treasurer
prior to final approval and prior introduction of such local
improvement ordinance.
[2] Such deposit shall be made concurrent with an agreement
between the applicant and the Borough concerning the
uses of the deposit, which shall include the following
stipulations: that said funds shall be used by the Borough
solely for the construction of such off-site and off-tract
§ 240-70 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-70
1:379
improvements as specified in said agreement and for the
other expenses incidental thereto and the acquisition of
any easements or rights-of-way in connection therewith;
that such deposit may be appropriated by the Borough,
with other funds of the Borough, toward the
accomplishment of such purposes and may be co-mingled
with other appropriated funds and expended by the
Borough within a specified time agreed upon by the
applicant, said funds shall be returned to the applicant;
that, upon completion of the work by the Borough or its
contractors, the properties specially benefitted by such
improvements shall be assessed as provided by law,
including the property of applicant; and that the
applicant's deposit shall be credited against the
assessment made upon the applicant's property, whether
or not the applicant is then the owner thereof, and if
such deposit was less than the amount ultimately assessed
against such property, then the owner(s) of said property
shall pay the difference between the deposit, the amount
assessed, and the excess shall be refunded to the applicant
without interest.
[3] Where said off-site and off-tract improvements are found
by the approving authority to be advisable and important
to the sound development of the site, although the off-site
and off-tract improvements may not be found to be the
type of essential off-site and off-tract improvements as
defined above, but the developer is unwilling to make such
deposit as specified above, then there shall be no final
approval until funds become available for the initial
appropriation required to adopt the local improvement
ordinance.
(7) The determination of the governing body whether or not to proceed
toward the adoption of a local improvement ordinance shall be
made within 30 days after the referral by the approving authority
unless such time shall be extended with the consent of the
applicant. If the determination is not made within the designated
period, the approving authority may proceed as if the governing
body had determined that it would not adopt such local
improvement ordinance.

sunset. Any adjacent residential zone or use shall be shielded from the
glare of illumination from site lighting and automobile headlights.
D. The light intensity at ground level shall average 0.5 footcandle;
however, variations are permitted depending upon the intensity of the
use. The light intensity shall not exceed 0.3 footcandle along any
property line and shall be so arranged and shielded to reflect the light
away from adjoining streets or properties.
E. The lighting plan shall indicate the proposed light intensity (including
existing fixtures to remain) at ground level where 0.5 footcandle occur.
Manufacturer's lighting detail and specifications, including footcandle
distributions, shall be provided. All lights shall be concealed-source

A. Essential off-site and off-tract improvements may be required to be
installed or a performance guaranty furnished in lieu thereof, with the
total cost borne by the developer.
(1) Where a development has no direct access to an improved street or
public or private central water supply or central sanitary sewer and
does not qualify for individual sewage disposal systems, the
approving authority may nevertheless grant final approval if the
developer shall acquire and improve such street between the
development and an existing improved street and, in the case of
water/sewer system(s), if the developer shall acquire and improve
such water and sanitary sewer connections between the
development and existing facilities as approved by the approving
authority, governing body and serving utility company.
(2) Where drainage waters are diverted from the development into
other drainage systems or onto other lands or streets and they are
not adequate to accommodate the additional waters, the approving
authority may grant final approval if the developer shall acquire,
improve and dedicate to the Borough such enlarged, additional or
new drainage facilities as approved by the approving authority and
governing body.
(3) Such off-site and off-tract improvements shall be subject to the

toward the adoption of a local improvement ordinance shall be
made within 30 days after the referral by the approving authority
unless such time shall be extended with the consent of the
applicant. If the determination is not made within the designated
period, the approving authority may proceed as if the governing
body had determined that it would not adopt such local
improvement ordinance.
A. The distribution supply lines and service connections shall be installed
underground, except that lots which abut streets with existing
overhead electric or telephone distribution supply lines and service
connections may be supplied with electric and telephone service from
those overhead lines, but the service connections shall be installed
underground. In the case of existing overhead utilities, should a road
widening or an extension of service or other such condition occur as a
result of the development and necessitate the replacement, relocation
or extension of such utilities, such replacement, relocation or extension
shall be underground.
B. The developer shall submit to the approving authority, prior to final
approval, a written instrument from each serving utility indicating full
compliance or intended full compliance with the provisions of this

C. Where natural foliage is not sufficient to provide year-round screening
of any utility apparatus appearing above the surface of the ground,
other than utility poles, the applicant shall provide sufficient live
screening to conceal such apparatus year round.
D. On any lot where soil conditions, rock formations, woods or other
special conditions exist and the applicant deems it a hardship to comply
with the provisions of this section, the applicant may apply to the
approving authority for an exception from the terms of this section.
Where overhead lines are permitted as the exception, the alignments
and pole locations shall be routed to avoid locations along horizons,
avoid the clearing of swaths through treed areas by selective cutting
and a staggered alignment, by planting trees in open areas at key
locations to minimize the views of the poles and alignments, by
following rear lot lines and other interior locations, and similar design
and location considerations to lessen the visual impact of overhead. The
Borough shall make the determination as to the location of utility poles.

or driveway or lower than eight feet above their center lines, excluding
street name signs and official traffic regulation signs. Where any street or
driveway intersection involves earth banks or vegetation, including trees,
the developer shall trim and grade to provide the sight triangle. The sight
triangle is that area outside the right-of-way bounded by the intersecting
street lines and a straight line which connects sight points located on
each of the two intersecting street center lines: arterial streets at 300
feet, collector streets at 200 feet and local streets at 90 feet. Where the
intersecting streets are both arterial and collector, two overlapping sight
triangles shall be required, formed by connecting the sight points noted
above with a sight point 90 feet on the intersecting street. Any development
requiring site plan approval shall provide sight triangles at each driveway,
with the driveway classified as a local street for purposes of establishing
distances. The classifications of existing and proposed streets shall be those
shown on the adopted Master Plan or as designated by the approving
authority where a new street is not included on the Master Plan. A sight
triangle easement shall be expressed on the plat as follows: "Sight triangle
easement subject to grading, planting and construction restrictions as
provided for in the Edgewater Land Use and Development Regulations
Ordinance." Portions of a lot set aside for the sight triangle may be
calculated in determining the lot area and minimum setbacks required by
the zoning provisions.

All development applications shall comply with the regulations set forth in
the Edgewater Soil Removal Ordinance, Chapter 362.
§ 240-87. Stormwater runoff.
A. All developments shall incorporate on-site stormwater facilities that
will encourage the recharging of underground aquifers and/or the
slowing down of the rate stormwater leaves the site.
B. Where the amount of runoff determined by the Municipal Engineer is
sufficient to justify detention of peak flow, one or more detention basins
shall be required. Each detention basin shall have a capacity to accept
all surface water directed to it from a one-hundred-year storm event
with outlets to permit complete draining of the maximum capacity of
the detention basin in not more than 36 hours.
C. Developments may incorporate other on-site stormwater detention or
impoundment facilities in the following manner:
(1) Swales to retard water runoff. Water velocity shall not exceed three
feet per second. The water may be directed to impact-still basins to
evaporate and percolate. The swales shall be seeded and
maintained in lawn area, as appropriate.
(2) Impoundment/detention basins along streams that maintain steady
flows of water may be constructed, provided that they meet the

front yard setback or front lot line, as follows:
(1) In cases of irregularly shaped lots whose sides are not parallel and
the lot width is measured at the required front yard setback, the
street frontage shall not be less than 60% of the minimum lot width
required, provided that the lot width measured at the front yard
setback line shall conform to the minimum width specified in the
zoning schedule for the district in which the lot is contained.
(2) In cases of irregularly shaped lots whose sides are not parallel, the
lot width may be measured at the front lot line, provided that the
width of the lot measured at the required front yard setback line
shall not be less that 85% of the required lot width measured at the
front lot line.
C. Within any sight triangle, no grade, vegetation, sign or other object
shall be allowed to exceed a height of 30 inches above the adjacent
roadway or be placed in such manner as to limit or obstruct the sight
distance of motorists entering or leaving the intersection. Said triangle
shall be formed by the street lines of such lot and a line drawn between
points along such street lines 25 feet distant from their point of
intersection.
D. Where a single lot under individual ownership extends from one street
to another, defined herein as a "through lot," both frontages shall be
subject to the front yard requirements of this chapter.
A. No yard or other open space provided about any building for the
purpose of complying with the provisions of this chapter shall be
considered as providing a yard or open space for any other building.
B. The sketch maps in the Appendix illustrate the delineation of the yards

NOTES:
* Except for permitted one- and two-family residences in an R-3 Zone,
where no buffer is required.
A. The landscape area shall provide a year-round visual screen to
minimize adverse impacts from the site on adjacent properties.
B. If the landscape area is less than 10 feet wide, the applicant may be
required to erect and landscape a six-foot-high stockade fence within
the buffer area parallel to the lot line of the abutting residential lot.
C. The landscape areas shall be maintained and kept clean of all debris,
rubbish, weeds and tall grass. Any screen planting shall be maintained
permanently, and any plant material which does not live shall be
replaced within one year or one growing season.
D. No structure, activity, storage of materials, driveways or parking of
vehicles shall be permitted in the landscape area, except permitted
signs as specified in the district regulations. Driveways may be
permitted to bisect the landscape area only to provide direct vehicular
access from the street into the lot.
E. Requirements for planting in landscape area.
(1) A solid and continuous landscaped screen shall be planted and
maintained to conceal the parking and loading areas, eliminate the
glare of vehicle lights throughout the year and camouflage the
building from the abutting residential areas. The landscaped
screen shall consist of evergreen trees, such as hemlock, Douglas
fir, Norway spruce, etc. Evergreen trees shall not be less than eight
feet high when planted, and the lowest branches shall be not more
than one floor above the ground. In the event that the existing
evergreen trees do not cover the required area from the ground,
§ 240-115 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-115
1:403
§ 240-116. Protection of steep slope areas. [Added 4-18-2011 by
Ord. No. 1452-2011106]
said landscaping screen shall be supplemented with evergreen
shrubbery.
(2) In addition to the landscaped screen, shade trees shall be planted
by the applicant at a distance of not more than 40 feet from each
other.
(3) If the landscape area includes existing growth of evergreen and
deciduous trees and shrubbery, but not enough to provide a
suitable screen as required above, existing trees and shrubbery
may remain and shall be supplemented by additional evergreen
plantings to provide the required landscaped screen. In the event
that the approving authority finds that additional plantings of
evergreens will not grow satisfactorily in said buffer areas, a
stockade fence(s) six feet high shall be erected in the buffer area.
F. The approving authority shall have the power to waive any of the
requirements or details specified above if it determines an adequate
buffer can be provided in less than the required width while
maintaining the purposes of this section. The approving authority, when
considering waiving any of the buffer requirements, shall review the
proposed plat and the standards and purposes of this chapter and, to
these ends, shall consider the location of buildings, parking areas,
outdoor illumination and topographic features of the area, and existing
features, such as trees and streams; the efficiency, adequacy and safety
of the proposed layout of driveways, streets, sidewalks and paths; the
adequacy and location of screening and parking areas, structures and
uses; and such other matters as may be found to have a material
bearing on the above standards and objectives.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the intensity of use in
areas of steeply sloping terrain in order to limit soil loss, erosion,
excessive stormwater runoff, the degradation of surface water and to
maintain the natural topography and drainage patterns of land.
B. Background. Disturbance of steep slopes results in accelerated erosion
processes from stormwater runoff and the subsequent sedimentation of
waterbodies with the associated degradation of water quality and loss
of aquatic life support. Related effects include soil loss, changes in
natural topography and drainage patterns, increased flooding potential,
further fragmentation of forest and habitat areas, and compromised
aesthetic values. It has become widely recognized that disturbance of
steep slopes should be restricted or prevented based on the impact
disturbance of steep slopes can have on water quality and quantity, and
the environmental integrity of landscapes.

areas.
§ 240-115 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-116
1:404
C. Applicability. This section shall be applicable to new development or
land disturbance on a steep slope within Edgewater.
D. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
DISTURBANCE  The placement of impervious surface, the exposure
of movement of soil or bedrock, or the clearing, cutting, or removing of
vegetation.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE  Any structure, surface, or improvement that
reduces or prevents absorption of stormwater into land, and includes
porous paving, paver blocks, gravel crushed stone, decks, patios,
elevated structures, and other similar structures, surfaces, or
improvements.
REDEVELOPMENT  The construction of structures or improvements
on areas which previously contained structures or other improvements.
STEEP SLOPES  Any slope equal to or greater than 20% as measured
over any minimum run of 10 feet. Steep slopes are determined based
on contour intervals of two feet or less.
E. Designation of areas. The percent of slope (rise in feet per horizontal
distance) shall be established by measurement of distance
perpendicular to the contour of the slope. The percent of slope shall be
calculated for each two-foot contour interval. For example, any location
on the site where there is a one-foot rise over a ten-foot horizontal run
constitutes a ten-percent slope; a one-and-one-half-foot rise over a tenfoot
horizontal run constitutes a fifteen-percent slope; a two-foot rise
over a ten-foot horizontal run constitutes a twenty-percent slope.
F. Steep slope limits.
(1) For steep slopes, any disturbance shall be prohibited except as
provided below:
(a) Redevelopment within the limits of existing impervious
surfaces; and
(b) New disturbance necessary to protect public health, safety or
welfare, such as necessary linear development with no feasible
alternative; to provide an environmental benefit, such as
remediation of a contaminated site; to prevent extraordinary
hardship on the property owner peculiar to the property; or to
prevent extraordinary hardship, provided the hardship was not
created by the property owner, that would not permit a
minimum economically viable use of the property based upon
reasonable investment. For example, redevelopment within the
footprint of existing impervious cover should be allowed to
support efforts to revitalize development that has fallen into
disrepair.
(2) Conditions on permitted disturbances.
§ 240-116 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-116
1:405
(a) Any permitted excavation, soil removal or disturbance of soil
shall be consistent with the intent of this article and shall be
executed in a manner that will not cause excessive erosion or
other unstable conditions.
(b) Provision shall be made for any structures or protective
measures that may be required for the protection of the public
safety, including but not limited to retaining walls, headwalls,
and fences.
(c) Provision shall be made for the proper disposition of surface
water runoff so that it will not create unstable conditions.
Appropriate storm drainage facilities shall be constructed as
deemed necessary and adequate protective measures shall be
provided for downstream properties.
(d) The applicant shall demonstrate through site plans depicting
proposed development and topography that new disturbance is
not located in areas with a twenty-percent-or-greater slope.
G. Conflicts and severability.
(1) Conflicts: All other ordinances, parts of ordinances, or other local
requirements that are inconsistent or in conflict with this section
are hereby superseded to the extent of any inconsistency or
conflict, and the provisions of this section apply.
(2) Severability and interpretation:
(a) Interpretation: This section shall be so construed as not to
conflict with any provision of New Jersey or Federal law.
(b) Notwithstanding that any provision of this section is held to be
invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
all remaining provisions of Ordinance shall continue to be of
full force and effect.
(3) The provisions of this section shall be cumulative with, and not in
substitution for, all other applicable zoning, planning and land use
regulations.
H. Enforcement, violation and penalties. A prompt investigation shall be
made by the appropriate personnel of Edgewater of any persons or
entity believed to be in violation hereof. If, upon inspection, a condition
which is in violation of this section is discovered, a civil action may be
brought in the Special Part of the Superior Court, or in the Superior
Court, if the primary relief sought is injunctive or if penalties may
exceed the jurisdictional limit of the Special Civil Part, by the filing and
serving of appropriate process. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to preclude the right of Edgewater, pursuant to N.J.S.A.
26:3A2-25, to initiate legal proceedings hereunder in Municipal Court.
The violation of any subsection of this section shall constitute a

§ 240-118. Pedestrian protection at construction sites. [Added
9-16-2008 by Ord. No. 1393-2008]
A. Temporary construction fence.
(1) Prior to the commencement of any site clearance, demolition,
excavation or other construction activity, a developer shall erect a
temporary construction fence along the entire boundary of the
construction site. Wherever it is safe and practical to do so, the
fence shall be located on the side of any existing sidewalk
("walkway") closest to the construction site, so as to preserve said
walkway for public use during the period of construction activity.
(2) The temporary construction fence shall be eight feet in height and
shall be constructed of nonclimbable, chain-link material.
(3) The temporary construction fence shall provide for gated access to
the construction site, which gate shall remain closed except during
working hours when construction activity is actively taking place,
and the gate shall be padlocked at the close of the workday.
(4) The temporary construction fence shall be maintained in good
condition until construction activity at the site is completed, at
which time the fence shall be removed. A certificate of occupancy
shall not be issued prior to removal of the construction fence.
(5) The temporary construction fence is authorized under this section
for reasons of public safety, and the provisions in Chapter 240 of
the Borough Code, § 240-137, Fences and walls, shall otherwise
remain in full force and effect.
B. Pedestrian walkways.
(1) Wherever safe and feasible, all existing pedestrian walkways shall
be preserved for continued public use during site clearance,
demolition, excavation or other construction activity. The developer
shall ensure that all pedestrian walkways in use are restored to
good repair along the entire length of the construction site prior to
commencement of any site clearance, demolition, excavation or
other construction activity.
(2) Where there is no existing walkway along a property boundary
which abuts a public is roadway, the developer shall install a
walkway along the entire length of the construction site prior to
commencement of any site clearance, demolition, excavation or
other construction activity.
(3) The developer shall ensure that all pedestrian walkways measure
at least four feet in width, are composed of a durable walking
surface and otherwise conform to § 240-74 of the Borough Code,
entitled "Sidewalks."
§ 240-118 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-118
1:417
(4) The developer shall maintain all walkways in good repair
throughout the course of construction. A certificate of occupancy
shall not issue if a walkway is not in good repair at the time of the
application.
C. Development review procedure.
(1) All applications for site plan approval and subdivision review shall
provide that the requirements in this section regarding temporary
construction fences and pedestrian walkways have been or will be
complied with, as the case may be. Final approval of plans shall not
be granted unless said plans contain drawings and provisions for a
temporary construction fence and walkway(s) in accordance with
this section.
(2) The Code section and title of this section shall be recited in every
developer's agreement after the effective date of this section and
the terms hereof incorporated therein and made a part thereof.
(3) The provisions of this section shall be applicable to every
construction site in the Borough in which a certificate of occupancy
has not been issued as of the effective date of this section, except as
otherwise provided herein.
D. Enforcement. The Code Officer for the Borough shall issue a cease and
desist order at any construction site failing to abide by the foregoing
provisions for a temporary construction fence or a walkway until such
time as there is full compliance with this section.

ARTICLE XII
Nonconforming Uses, Structures or Lots
§ 240-119. Continuation.
A lawful use of land, buildings or structures existing at the effective date
of this chapter may be continued on the lot or in the structure although it
may not conform to this chapter, and any such structure may be restored
or repaired in the event of partial destruction thereof; provided, however,
that none shall be enlarged, extended, relocated, converted to another
use or altered except in conformity with this chapter, except as permitted
below. Land on which a nonconforming use or structure is located and
any nonconforming lot shall not be subdivided so as to be made more
nonconforming.
§ 240-120. Abandonment.
A nonconforming use shall be considered abandoned if it is terminated by
the owner, if a nonconforming use involving a structure is discontinued
for 12 consecutive months, or if a nonconforming use of land without
structure(s) ceases for a period of six months. The subsequent use of the
abandoned building, structure and/or land shall be in conformity with this
chapter.
§ 240-121. Maintenance.
Maintenance may be made to a nonconforming use, structure or lot,
provided that the maintenance work does not change the use, expand the
building or the functional use of the building, increase the area of a lot used
for a nonconforming purpose or increase the nonconformity in any manner.
§ 240-122. Restoration and repairs.
A. Any nonconforming building, structure or use which has been
condemned or damaged by fire, explosion, flood, windstorm or act of
God shall be examined by the following three people: the Borough
Engineer, the owner or an architect or engineer selected by the owner,
and a third person agreed to by the Borough Engineer and the owner. If
the value of repairing the condition is greater than 50% of the value of
replacing the entire structure, it shall be considered completely
destroyed and may be rebuilt to the original specifications only upon
approval of a use variance as provided by state statutes.

I. General design standards.
(1) Building form and mass. All buildings should relate harmoniously to
the site's natural features and other on-site buildings, as well as
other structures in the vicinity that have a visual relationship and
orientation to the proposed buildings. Such features should be
incorporated into the design of building form and mass and assist
in the determination of building orientation in order to preserve
visual access to natural or man-made community focal points.
(2) Large horizontal buildings, i.e., buildings with a linear dimension of
more than 250 feet, should be broken into segments having vertical
orientation. A visual and/or physical break should be provided
minimally every 100 linear feet. Offsets consisting of a break in the
linear plan of the building of a minimum 2 1/2 feet shall be
required. Related architectural elements which preclude a
continuous uninterrupted facade building length may also be
utilized to achieve a break in the linear dimension of the building
walls in place of an offset if determined by the approving authority
to achieve the same purpose. All building foundations shall be
appropriately landscaped.
§ 240-123 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-123
1:424
(3) Buildings with expansive blank walls are prohibited. Appropriate
facade treatments should be imposed to ensure that such buildings
are integrated with the rest of the development.
(4) New buildings are encouraged to incorporate such building
elements as entrances, corners, graphic panels, display windows,
etc., as a means to provide a visually attractive environment.
(5) Cornices, awnings, canopies, flagpoles, signage and other
ornamental features should be encouraged as a means to enhance
the visual environment. Such features may be permitted to project
over pedestrian sidewalks, with a minimum vertical clearance of
8.5 feet, to within three feet of a curb.
J. Facade treatment.
(1) A human scale of development should be achieved at grade and
along street frontages through the use of such elements as
windows, doors, columns, awnings and canopies.
(2) Multitenant buildings shall provide varied storefronts and such
elements as noted above for all ground-floor tenants. Upper floors
shall be coordinated with ground floors through common materials
and colors.
(3) Design emphasis should be placed on primary building entrances.
They should be vertical in character, particularly when there is the
need to provide contrast with a long linear building footprint, and
such details as piers, columns and framing should be utilized to
reinforce verticality.
(4) Side and rear elevations should receive architectural treatments
comparable to front facades when public access or public parking
is provided next to the buildings.
(5) Rhythms which carry through a block, such as storefront patterns,
window spacing, entrances, canopies or awnings, etc., should be
incorporated into facades.
(6) The facade elevations of the parking deck shall receive
architectural treatment which complements the buildings located
on the deck's rooftop. For example, window cut-outs, framing and
other architectural vernacular detailing should be used to reinforce
the complementary appearance of the parking deck, integrating its
design into the overall project.
K. Material and texture.
(1) A variety of materials may be appropriate. Masonry, which works
well at the base of a building, can vary in size, color and texture and
enables the provision of a decorative pattern or band. Above 12
feet, it can be substituted with other suitable materials.
§ 240-123 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-123
1:425
(2) The use of fabric or metal canopies is to be encouraged, especially
over storefronts, at entrances or over display windows.
(3) Integration of large-scale graphics, where appropriate, into the
facade is encouraged.
L. Lighting.
(1) The use of creative lighting schemes to highlight building facades
and related areas of a site shall be encouraged. The use of
traditional-style lanterns and similar fixtures also shall be
encouraged. Exterior neon lights and lighting generating glare and
unnecessary nightglow impacts shall be prohibited.
(2) Whenever possible, light poles should be integrated into
landscaped islands.
M. Streetscape design.
(1) The use of street furniture (benches, tables, trash receptacles, etc.)
shall be encouraged throughout the development, provided that the
materials used are consistent with the overall concept of the
building design.
(2) Sidewalks should have a width of at least 10 feet along main
pedestrian streets where active pedestrian corridors are located
and active pedestrian movements are encouraged and located
along building frontages so as to tie the various buildings together.
Wider sidewalks may be designed for special places such as plazas
or courts.
N. Landscape.
(1) A hierarchy of landscape features should be established for the
site. The main entrance road should include street trees on each
side of the roadway, and such trees should be different than the
trees used in parking areas. Spacing between trees shall be a
maximum 40 feet unless another vertical element, such as a
decorative light fixture or blade sign, is used between the trees, in
which case a maximum of 60 feet shall be permitted. Trees along
primary streets should be in a formal arrangement, while informal
planting may be provided along access roads.
(2) Street trees and other plant material should be provided at the
ends of parking bays. Landscaped islands should be at least six feet
in width. This section does not apply to parking spaces in parking
garages.
(3) Trees should be a two-and-five-tenths- to three-inch caliper.
(4) Parking rows longer than 20 parking spaces should have a six-footwide
landscaped island to break the pavement. This section does
not apply to parking spaces in parking garages.

planted along the parking deck walls to break up the extended
building wall. Particular focus should be on the River Road corridor,
consistent with the Borough Master Plan recommendations.
O. Submittal requirements.
(1) An applicant for development in the Mixed-Use Commercial/
Residential Development Zone must submit a site plan indicating
the manner in which the entire fifteen-acre (plus or minus) tract is
to be developed. Said plan shall include all the data required for
site plan review and clearly indicate the distribution of use and
intensity of use of land within the tract. This zone-wide approach to
development in the MCRD Zone is mandated to ensure that the
zone tract is developed within the framework of a comprehensive,
integrated design and not in a piecemeal fashion.
(2) The submittal shall contain, in addition to the site plan submittal
provisions, a report detailing the following:
(a) An indication of the total number of dwellings units, by
bedroom count, and amount of nonresidential floor area and
the land area to be devoted to residential and each
nonresidential use, by use. The density and intensity of use of
the entire planned development shall be noted.
(b) A traffic and circulation plan, regarding vehicular and
pedestrian movements, addressing the goals and policy

1:432
(4) Cornices, awnings, canopies, flagpoles, signage and other
ornamental features should be encouraged as a means to enhance
the visual environment. Such features may be permitted to project
over pedestrian sidewalks, with a minimum vertical clearance of
8.5 feet, to within three feet of a curb.
(5) A variety of building materials may be appropriate. Masonry, which
works well at the base of a building, can vary in size, color and
texture and enables the provision of a decorative pattern or band.
Above 12 feet, it can be substituted with other complementary
materials.
(6) The use of fabric or metal canopies is to be encouraged, especially
over storefronts, at entrances or over display windows.

§ 240-147 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-147
1:457
H. To provide assurances that low- and moderate-income units are created
with controls on affordability over time and that low- and moderateincome
households occupy these units, Edgewater will designate an
administrative agency or municipal authority with the responsibility of
ensuring affordability of sales and rental units over time. The
administrative agency or municipal authority will be responsible for
those activities detailed in N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.1(a).
(1) In addition, the administrative or municipal authority will be
responsible for utilizing the verification and certification
procedures outlined in N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.1(b) in placing households in
low- and moderate-income units;

§ 240-147 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-147
1:458
§ 240-148. Affirmative marketing of inclusionary developments.
The affirmative marketing plan is a regional marketing strategy designed to
attract buyers and/or renters of all majority and minority groups, regardless
of sex, age or number of children, to housing units which are being
marketed by a developer/sponsor, municipality and/or designated
administrative agency of affordable housing. The plan will address the
requirements of N.J.A.C. 5:93-11. In addition, the plan prohibits
discrimination in the sale, rental, financing or other services related to
housing on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, handicap, age, familial
status/size or national origin. The Borough of Edgewater is in the housing
region consisting of Bergen, Passaic, Hudson and Sussex Counties. The
affirmative marketing program is a continuing program and will meet the
following requirements:
except if the alternative living arrangement is to receive a rental
bonus credit pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:93-5.13, then the controls on
affordability will extend for 30 years.
K. Section 14(b) of the Fair Housing Act, N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et seq.,
incorporates the need to eliminate unnecessary cost-generating
features from Edgewater's land use ordinances. Accordingly,
Edgewater will eliminate development standards that are not essential
to protect the public welfare and to expedite or fast track municipal
approvals/denials on inclusionary development applications. The
Borough of Edgewater will adhere to the components of N.J.A.C.
5:93-10.1 through 5:93-10.3.
L. Fees associated with the marketing and qualification of inclusionary
units shall be assigned to the developer of each inclusionary
development.
A. All newspaper articles, announcements and requests for applications
for low- and moderate-income units will appear in the following
newspapers/publications: The Record.
B. The primary marketing will take the form of at least one press release
sent to the above publications and a paid display advertisement in each
of the above newspapers. Additional advertising and publicity will be on
an as-needed basis.
C. The advertisement will include a description of the street address of
units, direction to housing units, number of bedrooms per unit, range of
prices/rents, size of units, income information, and location of
applications, including business hours and where/how applications may
be obtained.
D. All newspaper articles, announcements and requests for applications
for low- and moderate-income housing will appear in publications such
as neighborhood-oriented weekly newspapers, religious publications
§ 240-147 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-148
1:459
and organizational newsletters within the region. Regional radio and/or
cable television station(s) will also be used.
E. The following are the locations of applications, brochure(s), sign(s) and/
or poster(s) used as part of the affirmative marketing program,
including specific employment centers within the region: posting of
notices in the Borough Hall and delivery of notices to the municipal
clerks of all municipalities in the region.
F. The following is a listing of community contact persons and/or
organizations in Edgewater that will administer the program and will
aid in the affirmative marketing program with particular emphasis on
contacts that will reach out to groups that are least likely to apply for
housing within the region: Zoning Officer, County Housing Office and
houses of worship.
G. Quarterly flyers and applications will be sent to each of the following
agencies for publication in their journals and for circulation among
their members: Board of Realtors in Bergen, Hudson, Passaic and
Sussex Counties.
H. Applications will be mailed to prospective applicants upon request.
I. Additionally, quarterly informational circulars and applications will be
sent to the chief administrative employees of each of the following
agencies in the counties within Edgewater's region: welfare or social
service board, rental assistance office (local office of DCA), office on
aging, libraries and housing agency or authority in each of the counties
within Edgewater's housing region.
J. A random-selection method will be used to select occupants of low- and
moderate-income housing.
K. The Borough has retained Affordable Housing Management Services
(AHMS) to administer the affirmative marketing program. AHMS has
the responsibility to income-qualify low- and moderate-income
households; to place income-eligible households in low- and moderateincome
units upon initial occupancy; to provide for the initial occupancy
of low- and moderate-income units with income-qualified households; to
continue to qualify households for reoccupancy of units as they become
vacant during the period of affordability controls; to assist with
advertising and outreach to low- and moderate-income households; and
to enforce the terms of the deed restriction and mortgage loan as per
N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.1.
L. Households with residents who live or work in the COAH-established
housing region may be given preference for sales and rental units
constructed within that housing region. Applicants living outside the
housing region will have an equal opportunity for units after regional
applicants have been initially serviced. The Borough of Edgewater
intends to comply with N.J.A.C. 5:93-11.7.
§ 240-148 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-148
1:460
M. All developers of low- and moderate-income housing units will be
required to assist in the marketing of the affordable units in their
respective developments.
N. The marketing program will commence at least 120 days before the
issuance of either temporary or permanent certificates of occupancy.
The marketing program will continue until all low- and moderateincome
housing units are initially occupied and for as long as affordable
units are deed restricted and occupancy or reoccupancy of units
continues to be necessary.
O. AHMS (Affordable Housing Management Services) will comply with
monitoring and reporting requirements as per N.J.A.C. 5:93-11.6 and
5:93-12.1.

ARTICLE XVII
Growth Share
[Added 11-13-2006 by Ord. No. 1348-2006]
§ 240-149. Applicability.
This article of the land use regulations of the Borough of Edgewater sets
forth the mechanisms by which developers shall provide for a fair share
of affordable housing based on growth that is associated with development
taking place within the Borough of Edgewater.
§ 240-150. Exemptions.
The following exemptions are permitted under this article: all developments
that received preliminary or final approval from the Planning Board and/or
Board of Adjustment prior to the effective date of this article.
§ 240-151. Residential growth share provisions.
A. Residential development. Except as exempted in § 240-150, all
residential development in all zones that results in the construction of
new market-rate dwelling units in accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:94-1 et
seq., shall be subject to the growth share provisions of this article.
B. Nonresidential development. Except as exempted in § 240-150, all
nonresidential development in all zones that results in an increase in
gross floor area of any existing nonresidential structure or the
construction of a new nonresidential structure in accordance with
N.J.A.C. 5:94-1 et seq., shall be subject to the growth share provisions of
this article.
(1) This article applies to nonresidential development resulting in a net
increase in square footage. To calculate the net increase, any
square footage that is demolished is subtracted from new square
footage that is proposed for development, by use group.
(2) Nonresidential development resulting in the generation of fewer
than 25 jobs is subject to development fees rather than this article.
A. All residential development which results in the construction of new
market-rate dwelling units in the Borough of Edgewater, exclusive of
those exempted in § 240-150, shall provide one affordable unit for every
eight market-rate units constructed.
B. For residential developments that result in a number of market-rate
units not evenly divisible by eight, the developer may construct the
additional affordable unit on site, off site or make a payment in lieu of
constructing the additional affordable unit. If the developer seeks
payment in lieu, the amount of said payment will be established by
subtracting any whole multiples of eight from the total number of
market-rate residential units being created, dividing any remaining
§ 240-149 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-151
1:463
§ 240-152. Nonresidential growth share provisions.
number of units by eight and multiplying the resulting fraction by
$200,000.
C. All residential development consisting of less than eight residential
units may provide one affordable unit on site or make a payment in lieu
of constructing the proportionate fraction of the affordable housing
required. If the developer selects the latter option, the amount of said
payment shall be established by dividing the number of market-rate
units by eight and multiplying the resulting fraction by $200,000.
D. As an alternative to fulfilling the affordable housing requirements set
forth in § 240-151C above, developers of residential units in the
Borough of Edgewater may elect to construct an affordable housing
unit elsewhere in the Borough of Edgewater or purchase an existing
residential unit in the Borough of Edgewater, provided the unit is
identified at the time of site plan submission and the applicant sets
forth the manner in which the unit shall be acquired, the timing of the
acquisition, and the manner in which, and the timing of the conversion
of the units to an affordable unit, all pursuant to the applicable COAH
rules at N.J.A.C. 5:94-1 et seq.
A. All nonresidential development that results in an increase in gross floor
area of any existing nonresidential building or the construction of a new
nonresidential building in the Borough of Edgewater shall provide one
affordable unit for every 25 jobs that results from the application of
standards adopted by COAH (presently found in Appendix E of N.J.A.C.
5:94-1 et seq.) and based on use groups, as defined by the International
Building Code (IBC), which has been incorporated by reference into the
Uniform Construction Code (UCC).113
B. All nonresidential development shall provide one unit of affordable
housing for every 25 jobs created by new or expanded development.
Determinations of the number of jobs created shall be based on the new
or expanded floor area in the development and the conversion factors,
by use group, published by COAH in Appendix E in N.J.A.C. 5: 94-1 et
seq.
C. As an alternative to fulfilling the affordable housing requirements set
forth in § 240-152B above, the nonresidential developer may make a
payment in lieu of constructing the affordable units. The amount of said
payment shall be determined by establishing the number of jobs to be
created in a development by using the conversion factors published by
COAH in Appendix E in N.J.A.C. 5:94-1 et seq., dividing by 25 to
determine the number of affordable housing units required and
multiplying the resulting figure by $200,000.
113. Editor's Note: See Ch. 166, Construction Codes, Uniform.
§ 240-151 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-152
1:464
§ 240-153. Mixed-use (residential and nonresidential) development
standards.
All new mixed-use development or development that results in net increases
in existing or approved development shall be required to provide affordable
housing constructed at the sum of the calculation of applying the separate
ratios for the residential and nonresidential components of the development
as set forth above.
§ 240-154. General provisions for constructing affordable units.
D. For developments resulting in a number of jobs not evenly divisible by
25, the developer may make a payment in lieu of constructing the unit.
If a payment is made, said payment shall be established by subtracting
any whole multiples of 25 from the total number of jobs being created,
dividing any remaining number of jobs by 25 and multiplying the
resulting fraction by $200,000.
A. Affordable housing units being constructed on site shall meet the
requirements of Edgewater's Affordable Housing Ordinance and shall
be in conformance with COAH's third round rules at N.J.A.C. 5:94-1 et
seq., and the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls at N.J.A.C.
5:80-26.1 et seq., including, but not limited to requirements regarding
phasing schedule, controls on affordability, low-/moderate-income split,
heating source, maximum rent and/or sales price, affordability average,
bedroom distribution and affirmative marketing.
B. To the greatest extent possible, affordable housing units being provided
within inclusionary developments shall be disbursed throughout
inclusionary developments and shall be located within buildings
designed to be architecturally indistinguishable from the market-rate
units otherwise being constructed within the development. To that end,
the scale, massing, roof pitch and architectural detailing (such as the
selection of exterior materials, doors, windows, etc.) of the buildings
containing the affordable housing units shall be similar to and
compatible with that of the market-rate units.
C. The priority for providing affordable housing shall be as follows:
(1) The provision of the required number of affordable units shall be
met and required first through on-site construction, and on-site
construction shall be treated as the highest and best preference for
provision of affordable units. If on-site construction cannot be
accomplished, then the obligation shall be met through the
creation of affordable units elsewhere within the Borough of
Edgewater.
(2) A payment in lieu of construction to the Borough of Edgewater shall
only be allowed for satisfaction of a fractional obligation of less
than one unit. With approval by the Borough, a builder or developer
§ 240-152 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-154
1:465
may round up a fractional obligation to provide construction in
accordance with the above.
D. Specific regulations for affordable units within a nonresidential
development and/or mixed-use development are as follows:
(1) Affordable housing units may be constructed within or converted
from space above the first floor level in nonresidential mixed-use
buildings or may be constructed as new space above the first floor
level on the same site as a permitted nonresidential use or
development, subject to site plan review by the Board having
jurisdiction. This shall only be allowable where residential
dwellings situated above the first floor level are permitted pursuant
to the district regulations as set forth in this chapter of the
Borough.
(2) All affordable units shall comply with COAH's rules pertaining to
the phasing of construction, integration, split between low- and
moderate-income units, controls on affordability, bedroom
distribution, affirmative marketing, heating source, and
administration of the affordable units, as set forth in N.J.A.C. 5:94
et seq., as amended, and elsewhere in the rules.
E. Payments in lieu of the construction of affordable housing shall be
allowable only to satisfy a fractional obligation of less than one unit. The
cost of construction of one affordable unit is deemed to be $200,000 per
unit. The payment in lieu of construction for satisfaction of a fractional
obligation shall be pro rata in accordance with that cost.
F. Regulations with respect to prior approvals or agreements are as
follows:
(1) Development that has received preliminary or final approval before
the effective date of this article shall not be required to provide
affordable housing as set forth herein, unless it was part of the
previous approval, or a substantial change in the development is
sought. If a substantial change to a prior preliminary or final
approval is sought, then the developer shall be required to comply
with this article.
(a) For the purpose of preliminary or final approvals existing
before the effective date of this article, a "substantial change"
to such an approval is defined as follows:
[1] Five feet of improvements into any yard setback;
[2] Seven feet in building height;
[3] One percent in floor area ratio;
[4] One percent in impervious coverage;

1:466
[6] Three parking spaces;
[7] Five feet in driveway locations;
[8] One percent in site disturbances;
[9] Five feet in lot line locations;
[10] Any change in residential density;
[11] Any change in use that encompasses more than 1% of the
approved building floor area; and
[12] Any new variances pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40-55D-7(c) or (d).
(b) Any such change enumerated above shall not alter the
percentage of low- or moderate-income housing in an approved
project, if applicable.
(2) When a prior approval exists, this article shall be applicable as a
condition of approval under the following additional circumstances:
(a) In any application that seeks to extend or modify the expiration
date of a development approval; and
(b) In any application that seeks to extend or modify the statutory
period of protection as applicable to the particular
classification of approval granted.
(3) This article shall not change any existing and approved developer's
agreement between a developer and the Borough of Edgewater so
long as the agreement contains a negotiated and approved
requirement for meeting COAH obligations generated by the
development.
G. Other regulations are as follows:
(1) Every development applicant shall be required to submit a
proposed Affordable Housing Production Plan (AHPP) at the time
the application is made. The AHPP shall be a condition of the
completeness determination. Each AHPP shall be the subject of
review for consistency with COAH's rules, the Fair Housing Act,
this article, and the Borough's Housing Element and Fair Share
Plan, as proposed to and/or approved by COAH, and such other
rules and regulations as may be applicable. This review shall be
conducted by the Borough Planner or by such other person or
entity as shall be designated to administer the Borough's COAH
matters.
(2) The AHPP shall be approved by the board hearing the development
application. The board shall consider the impacts of the proposal
relative to its consistency with Borough's Housing Element and
Fair Share Plan, this article, and the applicable COAH regulations.
§ 240-154 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-154
1:467
§ 240-155. Payment in lieu provisions.
§ 240-156. Supplemental regulations.
(3) Compliance with COAH's rules and with the approved AHPP shall
be a condition of the board's resolution of approval and may be
covered by appropriate performance and maintenance guarantees
as with any other required improvement.
(4) It shall be the developer's responsibility, at its sole cost and
expense, to contract with a COAH-approved and Boroughdesignated
experienced entity for the initial and ongoing
administration of the controls on affordability so as to ensure full
COAH compliance. The designated administrative entity shall, by
February 1 of each year, and as otherwise required by COAH
throughout the year, file with the Borough Clerk of the Borough of
Edgewater such certifications, reports and/or monitoring forms as
may be required by COAH to verify the continuing compliance of
each affordable unit with COAH's rules.
(5) Developments covered by this article shall be exempt from the
payment of development fees pursuant to any development fee
ordinance adopted by the Borough.
A. Any payment in lieu amount of $200,000 shall be derived from the
analysis of the subsidy required to create an affordable housing in
Edgewater, which analysis shall be on file in the office of Borough
Administrator.
B. All payments in lieu of constructing affordable housing shall be
deposited by Edgewater into an affordable housing trust fund to be
established by Edgewater in conformance with the regulations
established by COAH and shall at all times be identifiable from
development fees. These funds shall be used by Edgewater in
accordance with regulations established by COAH to create new
affordable housing opportunities within the physical boundaries of
Edgewater.
A. The calculation of affordable housing obligation shall be a completeness
item during administrative review of the application. The calculation
shall be reviewed by the Borough Planner or other municipal official
designated by the municipality.
B. Compliance with COAH's rules shall be a condition of any approval by
the approving authority. The approving authority shall require that the
applicant or successor in interest comply with this article, when
applicable. The method of compliance shall be enumerated in the
approving authority resolution.

the combined requirements of each use as shown in the above
schedule or as approved by the Planning Board or Zoning
Board of Adjustment or as otherwise indicated in this chapter.
2. Drive-through lanes and windows for banks and other uses,
where permitted, shall be provided with room for queuing of
10 automobiles for each drive-through lane and/or window.
3. The inclusion of any use in this table is not meant to imply it is
a permitted use in the Borough. See the applicable sections of
this chapter for the enumeration of permitted uses.
C. Parking spaces for the disabled.
(1) In any parking lot, designated parking spaces for disabled persons
shall be required as follows:

(2) Parking spaces for the disabled shall be located in one area and
designated as parking for the handicapped. They shall be located
so that access does not require wheeling or walking behind parked
cars. Parking spaces for the disabled shall be at least eight feet
wide with a five-foot access area located adjacent to the driver's
side.
D. Parking area design standards.
(1) Aisle width. Provisions shall be made for the safe and adequate
circulation of vehicles and pedestrians within and adjoining the
subject property. Aisle widths providing direct access to individual
parking stalls shall be in accordance with the standards in Table 3.
Only one-way traffic shall be permitted in aisles of less than 24 feet
in width.
Table 3
Minimum Aisle Width

(2) Parking stalls shall be nine feet by 18 feet in dimension, provided
that parking stalls serving lots which contain retail uses utilizing
shopping carts shall be 10 feet by 20 feet. Hairpin striping of
parking spaces is required.
(3) Circulation within parking area.
(a) All parking spaces shall be designed free and clear of any
obstruction to individual parking stalls.
(b) Parking spaces shall be located in such a fashion as to permit
all vehicles to exit in a safe and orderly manner. Under no
condition shall vehicles be permitted to back out of a parking
lot driveway or otherwise block the free movement of traffic
within the parking area or specific points of safety control,
such as fire hydrants, doorways, elevators or other similar
locations.
(c) Aisle widths and circulation patterns shall be designed to
permit emergency and service vehicles such as delivery trucks,
solid waste collection vehicles and the like, to have reasonable
access to and space for their intended functions.
§ 240-166 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-166
1:486
(d) Pedestrian circulation within a parking area shall be, to as
great an extent as possible, separated from vehicular traffic.
Safety zones, crossing points and sidewalk areas, where
warranted, shall be provided.
(4) Driveway design criteria.
(a) Location of driveways. All entrance and exit driveways to a
public or private street shall be located so as to afford
maximum safety to said roadway, to provide for safe and
convenient ingress and egress and to minimize conflict with
the free flow of traffic. In no case shall unrestricted access
along the length of the street or streets upon which the parking
area abuts be permitted.
(b) Sight distances.
[1] The minimum sight distances established in Table 4 shall
be adhered to between a driveway and the adjoining street
in accordance with the sight triangle definition. Said
driveway shall be designed in profile, and grading shall be
reviewed by the Borough Engineer.
[2] For the purpose of this chapter, sight distance
measurement shall be measured from the driver's seat of a
standing vehicle, located on that portion of the exit
driveway that is immediately contiguous to the travelled
way, with the front of the vehicle 10 feet behind the rightof-
way line of the road, with the height of the eye (3.75
feet) to the top of the object (4.5 feet) above the pavement.

(c) Where a site is located at the intersection of two streets, no
driveway entrance or exit shall be located within 50 feet of the
point where the curb return of the street intersection and the
curbline meet.
§ 240-166 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-166
1:487
(d) No part of any driveway shall be located closer than 20 feet
from any other driveway on the adjoining parcel nor shall more
than one driveway be located closer than 40 feet to another
driveway on the same site, as measured from the closest edge
of any two driveways along the same right-of-way line.
(e) No entrance or exit driveway shall be located on a traffic circle
or on a ramp of an interchange or within 50 feet of the
beginning of any ramp or other portion of an interchange.
(f) Geometric design. The geometric design of a driveway
connection to a public or private street shall be governed by
sound traffic engineering principles. The following guidelines
are utilized in preparing a geometric design, but some
deviation may be necessitated from time to time due to the
many variables encountered in the course of preparing a
design. The applicant should be aware, therefore, that,
although the driveway layout may conform to these guidelines,
conditions may dictate deviation from them and that the
requirements of the Borough Engineer shall be final.
[1] Two-way operation. Driveways used for two-way operation
will intersect a public or private street at an angle to as
near 90° as site conditions will permit and in no case will
be less than 60°.
[2] One-way operation. Driveways used for vehicles in one
direction of travel (right turn only) shall not form an angle
smaller than 45° with a public street.
[3] The dimensions of driveways shall be designed to
adequately accommodate the volume and character of
vehicles anticipated to be attracted daily onto the land
development for which a site plan is prepared. The
required maximum and minimum dimensions for
driveways connecting to a public or private street at 90°
are indicated in Table 5. Driveways serving large volumes
of daily traffic, or traffic over 25% of which is truck traffic,
shall be required to utilize high to maximum dimensions.
Driveways serving low daily traffic volumes, or traffic less
than 25% of which is truck traffic, shall be permitted to use
low to minimum dimensions.

The screening shall be sufficient to obscure the view of parked
vehicles, loading platforms and loading activities from any lot line
or street line throughout the year. Fences and walls shall be
permitted to be used in combination with the landscaping and
berms if a site constraint exists which would limit the amount of
space for a sufficient buffer to fully screen said loading area. The
minimum height of the fence and/or wall shall be six feet.
(2) Parking areas with 20 or greater parking spaces shall be screened
from the street with landscaping, fencing or a wall, and interior
parking lot landscaping shall be required. Landscaped areas should

§ 240-170. General guidelines and requirements.
A. New towers and antennas. All new towers or antennas to be sited in the
Borough of Edgewater shall be subject to these regulations.
B. District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this article
shall govern the heights of all towers and antennas to be constructed in
each zoning district. The height limitations applicable to buildings and
structures shall not apply to towers and antennas facilities.
C. Preexisting towers and antennas. Any wireless communication tower or

requirements of this article, other than the requirements of § 240-170E
and F. This includes permitted towers or antennas that have not yet
been constructed, so long as such approval is current and not expired.
Any such towers or antennas shall be referred to in this article as
"preexisting antennas."
D. Public property. Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased
or otherwise controlled by the Borough of Edgewater shall be exempt
from the requirements of this article, provided a license or lease
authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by resolution by
the governing body. Said approved municipal sites utilized for the
purposes of construction or locating towers and/or antennas shall be
treated as engaging in a permitted use under this article. [Added
8-16-2010 by Ord. No. 1434-2010]
A. Purpose; goals. The purpose of this article is to establish general
guidelines for the siting of wireless communication towers and
antennas.
(1) The goals of this article are to:
(a) Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers and antennas;
(b) Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas;
(c) Minimize the total number of towers throughout the
community;
(d) Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower
sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional
single-use towers;
§ 240-168 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-170
1:496
(e) Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal;
(f) Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a
way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and
antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening,
and innovative camouflaging techniques;
(g) Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications
services to provide such services to the community quickly,
effectively and efficiently;
(h) Require that such towers are properly constructed, maintained
and dismantled, and that appropriate security is posted to
ensure same and the safety of Borough residents;
(i) Consider the public health and safety of communication
towers; and
(j) Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower
failure through engineering and careful siting of tower
structures.
(2) In furtherance of these goals, the Planning Board shall give due
consideration to the Borough of Edgewater's Master Plan, Zoning
Map, existing land uses and environmentally sensitive areas in
approving sites for the location of towers and antennas.
B. Principal or accessory use. Antennas may be considered either
principal or accessory uses, and towers shall be considered a principal
use only. A different existing use of an existing structure on the same lot
shall not preclude the installation of an antenna on such lot but shall
preclude the construction of a tower. For the purpose of determining
whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning
regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot
coverage requirements and other such requirements, the dimensions of
the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be
located on leased parcels within such lots.
C. Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower
shall provide to the Planning Board an inventory of all existing towers,
antennas or sites approved for towers or antennas that are both within
the jurisdiction of the governing authority and within 1/4 mile of the
border thereof, including specific information about the location, height
and design of each tower.
D. Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this Subsection D shall
govern the aesthetic appearance of all towers and the installation of all
antennas governed by this article; provided, however, that the Planning
Board may grant variances to these requirements if it determines that
§ 240-170 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-170
1:497
the goals of this article are better served thereby and in accordance
with the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL).
(1) Towers shall maintain a galvanized steel finish, subject to any
applicable standards of the FAA, and shall be painted a neutral
color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. Colors, textures,
screening, camouflage and landscaping shall be used to blend the
tower facilities to the natural setting and surrounding environment.
(2) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment shall
be camouflaged so as to make the antenna and related equipment
as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(3) Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the FAA
or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the Planning
Board may review the available lighting alternatives and approve
the design that would cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views and residential areas.
E. Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, FCC and any other agency of the
federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas.
If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the
towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers
and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards
and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is
mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and
antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations
shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the
owner's expense. Any such removal shall be ordered by the Planning
Board, as all approvals granted herein shall be unequivocally deemed
conditional approvals subject to this provision, or by order of the
Edgewater Construction Official.
F. Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of
all wireless communication towers within the Borough of Edgewater,
the owner of each tower shall ensure that the tower is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in the Uniform Construction Code
and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the
Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If
upon inspection the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to
comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to
persons or property, then, upon notice being provided to the owner of
the tower, the owner shall have 10 days to bring such tower into
compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower
into compliance within said 10 days, then the Mayor and Council, in
conjunction with the Borough of Edgewater's Construction Official, may
order the removal of such tower at the owner's expense, and lien the
property for all costs incurred, including professional fees expended.
§ 240-170 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-170
1:498
§ 240-171. Permitted uses.
G. Signs. No signs or other nonessential accoutrements shall be allowed
on any antenna or tower, with the exception of warning signs or other
signs required by federal, state or local law.
H. Buildings and support equipment associated with the antennas or
towers shall comply with the requirements of § 240-174.
I. Access road. All access roads leading to the tower and antenna area
shall be paved with asphalt. The access road shall include an area for
sufficient parking and turnaround radius for at least one vehicle.
J. Not essential services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this article and shall not be regulated or
permitted as essential services, public utilities, or private utilities.
K. Franchises. Owners and/or operators of towers or antennas shall certify
that all franchises required by law for the construction and/or operation
of a wireless communication system in the Borough of Edgewater have
been obtained, and shall file a copy of all required franchises with the
Clerk of the Borough of Edgewater, who shall distribute copies of same
to the Borough Construction Official and Edgewater Building
Department.
L. Maximum tower height. The maximum height of any tower shall not
exceed 70 feet. For purposes of measurement, the maximum tower
height shall include any structures supported by the tower and any
antenna.
A. General. The uses listed in this § 240-171 are deemed to be permitted
uses and shall require minor site plan approval. Nevertheless, all such
uses shall comply with the requirements set forth under § 240-170D, E,
F, G, H, I, J, K and L of this article and all other applicable ordinances.
B. Specific permitted uses. The following uses are specifically permitted:
(1) Locating a tower, including the placement of supporting equipment
used in connection with said tower, in the R-3, R-4, R-5, SRH,
MCRD, CBD, B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, MXD-1, MXD-2, MXD-3 and OR-1
Zoning Districts; provided, however, that such tower shall be set
back from any existing off-site residence a distance equal to the
height of the tower; [Amended 12-17-2012 by Ord. No.
1485-2012; 9-15-2014 by Ord. No. 1512-2014]
(2) Installing an antenna on an existing structure other than a tower
(such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower or other
freestanding structure) that is no less than 60 feet in height, so
long as said antenna adds no more than 10 feet to the height of said
existing structure; provided, however, that the aforesaid height
restrictions shall not apply to any structures owned by the Borough
of Edgewater; and
§ 240-170 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-171
1:499
§ 240-172. Administrative approvals.
§ 240-173. Nonpermitted towers and antennas; use variances.
(3) Installing an antenna on any existing tower of any height, so long as
the addition of said antenna adds no more than 10 feet to the height
of said existing tower.
A. The Edgewater Planning Board has exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to
the MLUL and this article, unless it is determined that the Edgewater
Board of Adjustment has jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of the
Municipal Land Use Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq., at which point the
provisions of this article shall apply to the Edgewater Board of
Adjustment.
B. Each applicant for administrative approval shall apply to the Planning
Board or the Zoning Board of Adjustment as indicated supra, providing
the information required in this article, together with a nonrefundable
fee as established by resolution of the Borough Council to reimburse
the Borough of Edgewater for the costs of reviewing the application.
C. The Planning Board or the Zoning Board of Adjustment, as indicated
supra, shall review the application and determine if the proposed use
complies with the provisions of this article.
A. Applicability. If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under

article.
§ 240-173 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-173
1:501
C. Factors considered in granting use variances. The Edgewater Zoning
Board of Adjustment shall consider the following factors in determining
whether to issue a use variance:
(1) Height of the proposed tower;
(2) Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;
(3) Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
(4) Surrounding topography;
(5) Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
(6) Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating
visual obtrusiveness;
(7) Proposed ingress and egress; and
(8) Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as
discussed in Subsection D of this section.
D. Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new
tower or antenna shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board of Adjustment that no
existing tower, antenna site, structure or alternative technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures can accommodate the
applicant's proposed tower or antenna. Evidence submitted to
demonstrate that no existing tower, antenna site, or structure can
accommodate the applicant's proposed tower or antenna may consist of
any of the following:
(1) No existing towers, antenna site or structures are located within
the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering
requirements.
(2) Existing towers, antenna sites or structures are not of sufficient
height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
(3) Existing towers, antenna sites or structures do not have sufficient
structural strength to support the applicant's proposed tower or
antennas and related equipment.
(4) The applicant's proposed tower or antenna would cause
electromagnetic interference with the antennas on the existing
towers, antenna sites or structures, or the antennas on the existing
towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's
proposed tower or antenna.
(5) The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower, antenna site or structure, or to
adapt an existing tower, antenna site or structure for sharing, are
§ 240-173 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-173
1:502
unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower or antenna development
are presumed to be unreasonable, and a cost comparison shall be
admissible evidence of same.
(6) The applicant demonstrates that there are significant other limiting
factors that render existing towers, antenna sites and structures
unsuitable.
(7) Applicant shall have the affirmative obligation of proving that it has
attempted to enter into a contract with the owners of the existing
towers, antenna sites and structures:
(a) This obligation shall include copies of all correspondence as to
rates, cost of contributions, etc.
(b) Copies of rejection of the offers propounded on the applicant
by the owners of the existing structures, antenna sites and/or
towers.
(c) Written cost proposals indicating actual quoted figures
required by the owner of the existing structures, antenna sites
and/or towers.
(d) A detailed cost analysis indicating the cost to the applicant to
construct new tower, antennas and/or structure.
(8) The applicant shall further demonstrate that an alternative
technology that does not require the use of towers, antennas or
structures, such as a cable microcell network using multiple lowpowered
transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is
unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower
or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the
technology unsuitable.
E. Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all new
towers for which a use variance is required; provided, however, that the
Edgewater Zoning Board of Adjustment may reduce the standard
setback requirements in any industrial or commercial zoning district if
the goals of this article would be better served thereby:
(1) Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower
from any adjoining lot line.
(2) Towers, guys and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum
zoning district setback requirements.
F. Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less
than eight feet in height and shall be slatted and equipped with an
appropriate anticlimbing device; provided, however, that the Zoning
Board of Adjustment may grant a variance of such requirements as it
deems appropriate.
§ 240-173 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-173
1:503
§ 240-174. Bulk standards for buildings and other equipment
storage.
G. Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping
surrounding the towers for which a use variance is required; provided,
however, that the Zoning Board of Adjustment may grant variance of
such requirements if the goals of this article would be better served
thereby.
(1) Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials
that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from
adjacent property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped
strip at least four feet wide and 12 feet high outside the perimeter
of the compound.
(2) Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible.
A. Antennas mounted on structures or rooftops. The equipment cabinet or
structure used in association with an antenna facility shall comply with
the following:
(1) The cabinet or structure shall not contain more than 200 square
feet of gross floor area or be more than 15 feet in height. In
addition, for buildings and structures which are less than 60 feet in
height, the related unmanned equipment structure, if over 150
square feet of gross floor area or 12 feet in height, shall be located
on the ground and shall not be located on the roof of the structure.
(2) If the equipment structure is located on the roof of the building,
then the area of the equipment structure and other equipment and
structures shall not occupy more than 15% of the roof area.
(3) Equipment storage buildings or cabinets shall comply with all
applicable building codes.
(4) Equipment storage buildings or cabinets shall be sufficiently
insulated so that any noise generated from the equipment shall not
exceed 50 decibels at the property line.
B. Antennas located on towers. The related unmanned equipment
structure shall not contain more than 200 square feet of gross floor area
or be more than 15 feet in height and shall be located in accordance
with the minimum yard requirements of the zoning district in which
located.
C. Modification of building size requirements. The requirements of
Subsections A and B may be modified by the Planning Board when
doing so would encourage co-location by multiple users.
§ 240-173 EDGEWATER CODE § 240-175
1:504
§ 240-175. Letter of intent.
A letter of intent shall be provided by all applicants seeking approval to
construct a wireless communication tower, committing the tower owner and
its successors to allow the shared use of the tower if additional users agree
in writing to meet reasonable terms and conditions for shared use, and
that the tower owner acknowledges and agrees that its successors and/or
individual users shall be bound and will conform to the requirements of this
article, as applicable.
§ 240-176. Removal of abandoned antennas and towers.
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12
months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna
or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the
Edgewater Building Department notifying the owner of such abandonment.
If such antenna or tower is not removed within said ninety-day period, the
Mayor and Council may order the removal of such antenna or tower at the
owner's expense, and lien the property for the costs associated therewith,
inclusive of professional fees. If there are two or more users of a single
tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease
using the tower.
§ 240-177. Nonconforming uses.
§ 240-178. Approvals; compliance with laws.
The applicant's use of the premises is contingent upon its obtaining all
certificates, permits, zoning and other approvals that may be required by
any federal, state or local authority. The applicant shall erect, maintain and
operate its antenna facilities in accordance with site standards, statutes,
ordinances, rules and regulations now in effect or that may be issued
hereafter by the Federal Communications Commission or any other
A. Preexisting towers. Preexisting towers shall be allowed to continue
their usage as they presently exist. Routine maintenance (including
replacement with a new tower of like construction and height) shall be
permitted on such preexisting towers. New construction other than
routine maintenance on a preexisting tower shall be performed in
compliance with the requirements of this article.
B. Rebuilding damaged or destroyed nonconforming towers or antennas.
Nonconforming towers or antennas that are damaged or destroyed may
be rebuilt without having to first obtain administrative approval or a
conditional use permit. The type, height and location of the tower on
site shall be of the identical type and intensity as the original facility.
Building permits to rebuild the facility shall comply with the then
applicable building codes and shall be obtained within 180 days from
the date the facility is damaged or destroyed. If no permit is obtained or
if said permit expires, the tower or antenna shall be deemed abandoned
as specified in § 240-176.
§ 240-175 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 240-178
1:505
governing bodies. Should any conflict arise between local zoning ordinances
and rules or regulations promulgated by the FCC, the FCC rules and
regulations shall govern.
§ 240-179. Fees.
§ 240-180. Applicable laws.
The applicant shall, at its expense, comply with all present and future
federal, state and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations (including
laws and ordinances relating to health, radio-frequency emissions, other
radiation and safety) in connection with the use, operation, maintenance,
construction and/or installation of the antenna facilities and/or the
premises. The municipality agrees to reasonably cooperate with the
applicant in obtaining, at the applicant's expense (including the
municipality's reasonable attorney and administrative fees), any federal
licenses and permits required for or substantially required by the
applicant's use of the premises.
§ 240-181. Enforcement; hold harmless; violations and penalties.
A. All wireless telecommunications towers and antenna facilities within

§ 322-5. Maintenance.
The emergency responder radio coverage system shall be maintained
operational at all times in accordance with the following:
coverage on each floor of the building is not less than 90%. The test
procedure shall be conducted as follows:
(1) Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of 20
approximately equal test areas.
(2) The test shall be conducted using a calibrated portable radio of the
latest brand and model used by the agency talking through the
agency's radio communications system.
(3) Failure of not more than two nonadjacent test areas shall not result
in failure of the test.
(4) In the event that three of the test areas fail the test, in order to be
more statistically accurate, the floor shall be permitted to be
divided into 40 equal test areas. Failure of not more than four
nonadjacent test areas shall not result in failure of the test. If the
system fails the forty-area test, the system shall be altered to meet
the 90% coverage requirement.
(5) A test location approximately in the center of each test area shall
be selected for the test, with radio enabled to verify two-way
communications to and from the outside of the building through the
public agency's radio communications system. Once the test
location has been selected, that location shall represent the entire
test area. Failure in the selected test location shall be considered
failure of that test area. Additional test locations shall not be
permitted.
(6) The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured, and the test
measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner
so that the measurements can be verified during annual tests. In
the event that the measurement results become lost, the building
owner shall be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish
the gain values.
(7) As part of the installation, a spectrum analyzer or other suitable
test equipment shall be utilized to ensure spurious oscillations are
not being generated by the subject signal booster. This test shall be
conducted at the time of installation and subsequent annual
inspections.
D. FCC compliance. The emergency responder radio coverage system
installation and components shall also comply with all applicable
federal regulations, including, but not limited to, FCC 47 CFR Part
90.219.

§ 322-6. Violations and penalties.
Any persons or entities found to be in violation of these requirements of
this chapter shall, upon certification of said violation by the Borough of
Edgewater Fire Official, be subject to a penalty. Such penalties shall not
exceed a rate of $1,000 per day for failure to abate the violation. If the
violation is not remedied within three months, the certificate of occupancy
for the building in violation may be revoked.
§ 322-7. Payment of fees.
The applicant for a permit under this chapter shall be responsible for all
fees for review and inspection of the radio amplification system incurred by
the Borough's public safety radio engineer and shall be charged the hourly
rate approved by the Borough.
A. Testing and proof of compliance. The emergency responder radio
coverage system shall be inspected and tested annually or where
structural changes occur, including additions or remodels that could
materially change the original field performance tests. Testing shall
consist of the following:
(1) In-building coverage test as described in § 322-4C.
(2) The signal booster shall be tested to verify that the gain is the same
as it was upon initial installation and acceptance.
(3) Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load of a
period of one hour to verify that they will properly operate during
an actual power outage. If, within the one-hour test period, the
battery exhibits symptoms of failure, the test shall be extended for
additional one-hour periods until the integrity of the battery can be
determined.
(4) Other active components shall be checked to verify operation
within the manufacturer's specifications.
(5) At the conclusion of the testing, a report, which shall verify
compliance with this subsection, shall be submitted to the Fire
Code Official.
B. Additional frequencies. The building owner shall modify or expand the
emergency responder radio coverage system at his or her expense in
the event frequency changes are required by the FCC or additional
frequencies are made available by the FCC. Prior approval of a public
safety radio coverage system on previous frequencies does not exempt
this section.
C. Field testing. Agency personnel shall have the right to enter onto the
property at any reasonable time to conduct field testing to verify the
required level of radio coverage.

underground or below the surface. Absent a showing by the public utility
that the pipeline, facility or fixture may not be installed on a portion of the
subject premises entirely underground, the Mayor and Council may grant
a waiver of this requirement subject to such conditions such as location,
buffering and landscaping as may be reasonably imposed.

The health and safety of residents of the Borough of Edgewater are
impaired and threatened by the existence of substandard multiple dwellings
within the Borough.
§ 339-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 339-4
1:613
§ 339-4. Substandard multiple dwellings: complaint procedure;
hearing.
Whenever it appears by preliminary investigation that a multiple dwelling
is substandard, the Supervisor shall cause a complaint to be served upon
the owner of and parties in interest in such multiple dwelling, stating the
reasons why said multiple dwelling is deemed to be substandard and setting
a time and place for hearing before said Supervisor. The owners and parties

testimony. The rules of evidence shall not be controlling in hearings before
the Supervisor.
§ 339-5. Findings of hearing; order and time limit for repairs.
If, after notice and hearing, the Supervisor determines that the multiple
dwelling under consideration is substandard, he shall state his findings
in writing and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner or
other person entitled to receive rents an order requiring that such repairs,
alterations or improvements necessary to bring such property up to
minimum standards be made within a reasonable time, the date of the
expiration of said reasonable time to be set forth in the said order.

substandard multiple dwelling.
§ 339-7. Basis for establishing maximum rents; determination of
net operating income.
A. In establishing maximum rents which may be charged for housing
space in a multiple dwelling subject to rent control, the permissible
rents shall be sufficient to provide the owner or other person entitled to
receive said rents with a fair net operating income from the multiple
dwelling. The net operating income shall not be considered less than
fair if it is 20% or more of the annual income in the case of a multiple
dwelling containing less than five dwelling units or if 15% or more in
the case of a multiple dwelling containing five or more dwelling units.
B. In determining the fair net operating income, the Supervisor shall
consider the following items of expense: heating fuel, utilities, payroll,
janitorial materials, real estate taxes, insurance, interior painting and
decorating, depreciation and repairs and replacements and additions to
furniture and furnishings, which expenses shall be deducted from the
annual income derived from the multiple dwellings. All items of

by the Supervisor.

nonapplicability to existing leases. [Amended 9-3-1975 by Ord. No.

The imposition of rent control on any substandard multiple dwelling shall
not impair any leases existing at the time of the adoption of this article, but
shall take effect at the expiration of the term of any such lease and shall
remain in effect thereafter so long as the multiple dwelling is subject to rent
control.
§ 339-9. Restrictions and rights of owner regarding rents.
§ 339-10. Lifting of rent controls.
Whenever the Supervisor finds that a multiple dwelling subject to rent
control is no longer substandard, he shall so inform the governing body and
rent control on said multiple dwelling shall be removed.
§ 339-11. Supervisor appointed receiver ex officio in case of
noncompliance.
In the event that the owner of the substandard multiple dwelling fails to
comply with an order for repair, alteration or improvement, after notice and
reasonable opportunity to do so and where such failure to comply results
in the continuation of the condition or conditions harmful to the health and
safety of the occupants of the multiple dwelling or to the general public, the
Supervisor may, by and with the approval of the Mayor and Council, bring
an action in the Superior Court to be appointed receiver ex officio of the
rents and income from such property and expend the same for the purpose
of making such repairs, alterations or improvements as are necessary to
correct said harmful condition or conditions.
§ 339-12. Rents and income to be available for costs and expenses
caused by violation. [Amended 9-3-1975 by Ord. No. 581-75]

A. It shall be unlawful for any person to demand or receive any rent in
excess of the maximum rent established for housing space in multiple
dwellings subject to rent control or to demand possession of the space
or evict a tenant for refusal to pay rent in excess of the established
maximum rent.
B. The owner or other person entitled to receive said rents shall not be
prevented, however, from exercising his rights to obtain possession of
housing space from a tenant as a result of the tenant's violation of law
or contract, and the owner or other person entitled to receive said rents
shall be provided reasonable grounds to obtain possession of premises
for his own personal use and occupancy or to demolish the multiple
dwelling.
§ 339-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 339-12
1:615
as may be adjudged by the court, and for the payment to the municipality
of any fines or permits which may have been imposed on the owner for
violations of this article and which have not been paid by the person liable
therefor.
§ 339-13. Appointment of mortgagee by Supervisor; dereliction by
mortgagee.
§ 339-14. Registration of owners of multiple dwellings.
Every owner and manager of every multiple dwelling in the Borough of
Edgewater shall register his name and address with the Borough Clerk
on forms prescribed by and furnished by said Borough Clerk. Every such
registration shall include the name and address of the owners and the
name and address of an agent in charge of the premises residing in the
municipality.
§ 339-15. Standards for substandard dwellings.
The standards which shall govern the Supervisor determining whether a
multiple dwelling is substandard shall be those minimum standards which
A. Upon his appointment, the Supervisor, acting as receiver, by and with
the approval of the Mayor and Council, in all cases where the real
property in question is encumbered by a first mortgage, shall appoint
such first mortgagee, if such mortgagee is a proper person and is
willing to accept such appointment, as the receiver's agent to collect
the rents and income from such rental property and manage the same;
and in all other cases the receiver, by and with the approval of the
Mayor and Council, may designate the person in charge of management
of such real property or some other competent person as the receiver's
agent to collect the rents and income from such real property and
manage the same. The said mortgagee or other person shall account
promptly to the receiver for the rents and income so collected.
B. If the mortgages or other persons so designated are derelict in
collecting or accounting for such rents and income or in the
management of such real property, the receiver shall apply to the court
for the removal of such designated mortgages or other persons, upon
notice in writing to them, and the court upon removing such designated
mortgagee or other persons, in its discretion, may designate another
person to collect the rents and income from such real property and
manage the same and account to the receiver for the rents and income
of such real property as aforesaid. In any such receivership no fees shall
be allowed the receiver or his counsel for action as such receiver or
counsel. Except as otherwise provided herein, the procedure in respect
to any such receivership shall be as in the case of receiverships to
secure the payment of delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, costs and
expenses wherein a collector of taxes of the municipality or other
officer of the municipality is such receiver.

E. In the event that the landlord applies for a hardship rental increase, and
the time of the application coincides with the anniversary date upon
which the landlord would be permitted to increase the rent under
§ 339-21 of this article, then the landlord shall be permitted to increase
the rent to the extent of the maximum allowable percentage during the

be considered by the Board as a hardship increase and/or capital
improvement surcharge, shall have three written estimates as to the
cost or expense of said item, in order for the Board to determine its
reasonableness. [Added 9-3-1986 by Ord. No. 847-86]
G. Any hardship rental increase granted pursuant to this section shall be
apportioned over a thirty-six-month period. The amount so apportioned
shall not be considered as base rent in the calculation of annual rental
increases but shall be considered as a separate charge unrelated to
base rent. [Added 4-21-1987 by Ord. No. 861-87]
A. A landlord may seek a surcharge for capital improvements made by him
in the rental unit or attributable to the rental unit.
B. As used herein and hereinafter, "capital improvement" shall mean a
substantial change in the housing accommodations such as would
materially increase the rental value of the subject premises in a normal
market, i.e., an added benefit to the subject premises and the tenant's
enjoyment thereof.
C. The landlord must notify each tenant by certified mail, return receipt
requested, or personal service and by posting in a conspicuous place in
the lobby of the building or, if there is no lobby, then in a conspicuous
location, at least 20 days prior to the hearing, of the total cost of the
completed capital improvement, the number of years of useful life of the
improvement, the average costs of the improvement, the total number
of square feet of the dwelling or apartment complex, the total square
feet occupied by the tenant and the capital improvement surcharge he
is seeking from each, so as to indicate the costs for the improvement
per square foot per month, the total for each tenant per month and the
number of years of duration of the surcharge.
D. The landlord seeking a capital improvement surcharge shall appeal for
said surcharge to the Rent Control Board, which shall determine if said
improvement is a major improvement and, if so, may permit such
increase to take place. If said increase is granted, it shall not be
considered rental and shall not be considered part of the base rent for
computing rent increases.
E. The amount of monthly increase allocated to a capital improvement
surcharge which a landlord may charge, if the landlord's application is
granted by the Rent Control Board, shall be determined by the Board as
to said improvement's life cycle.

1:624
§ 339-26. Delivery of notices.
All required notices herein mentioned may, at the option of the landlord, be
either hand-delivered and personally served by the landlord or his agents
and employees, or delivered by certified mail, return receipt requested. In
any event, the burden of proof of actual delivery shall be on the landlord.
§ 339-27. Vacancy decontrol.
A. Every petition filed with the Rent Control Board of the Borough of
Edgewater seeking a hardship increase or a capital improvement
surcharge shall be accompanied by the tax bill for the property, to
demonstrate if taxes or assessments for local improvements are due or
delinquent on the property which is the subject of such petition. If it is
shown that taxes or assessments are delinquent on said property, any
rental increase in excess of the maximum allowable percentage, or any
capital improvement surcharge granted by said Board, shall be
conditioned upon either the prompt payment of such taxes or
assessments or the making of adequate provision for the payment
thereof in such manner that the municipality will be adequately
protected.
B. Every petition shall contain a certification by the Building Code Official
that there are no Housing or Health Code violations more than 60 days
old. An application for hardship rental increase or capital improvement
surcharge will not be heard by the Rent Control Board until there has
been material compliance with the Housing and Health Codes, which
shall mean that 100% of those prior existing violations shall have been
remedied. The Board may condition any rental increase above the
maximum allowable percentage of surcharge on the receipt of
certifications from the local Building Code Official or Health Officer that
all of the violations have been corrected. As used herein, the term
"violations" shall mean any and all defects which affect the habitability
of the subject premises and the tenant's right to a safe, sanitary, decent
place to reside. [Amended 9-3-1986 by Ord. No. 847-86]
A. Notwithstanding any limitations upon permissible rent increases under
any other provision of this article, upon the voluntary, uncoerced
vacation of any apartment, the landlord shall have the right to fix the
rent for such vacated apartment at such a sum as he deems
appropriate.
B. Filing of statement; hearing.
(1) In order for a landlord to qualify for the vacancy decontrol rent
increase, the landlord shall first be required to file with the Rent
Control Board a written statement, signed by the vacating tenant,
certifying to the Board that the landlord has not, in any way,
harassed or pressured the tenant into vacating the housing space
unit and that the vacation of such unit was a voluntary act on the
part of the tenant. Such noncoercion certification shall not be
§ 339-25 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 339-27
1:625
§ 339-28. Conversion to condominiums or cooperative units.
required in order for the landlord to qualify for the vacancy
decontrol increase if the increase does not exceed the total of all
permissible increases authorized by any other provisions of this
article, the tenant has moved from the unit without notice to the
landlord, the unit has been vacated pursuant to a court-ordered
eviction, unless the court-ordered eviction shall have been the
result of a dispute brought about by changes in the terms of a
lease, or the tenant has refused to sign such certification, and upon
appeal by the landlord, the Rent Control Board has found that such
refusal was unwarranted, and that there was, in fact, no coercion
exerted by the landlord upon the vacating tenant.
(2) A hearing pursuant to Subsection B(1) above shall be held before
the Rent Control Board upon at least seven days' notice to the
public and the vacating tenant. Pending the result of the hearing,
the landlord may increase the rent as permitted by § 339-27A.
C. The decontrol provisions of this section shall only apply to dwelling
units which are physically vacated subsequent to the effective date of
this section.
D. Upon vacation of any apartment hereafter, the landlord shall file a
statement with the Rent Control Board, certifying to the Board the
apartment and building numbers of such dwelling unit, the rent paid by
the vacating tenant, the maximum rent increase which would be
permissible under the other provisions of this chapter, the number of
days such apartment remains vacant, the rent agreed to by the new
tenant for such apartment, and that the vacation of such apartment was
the voluntary act of the vacating tenant and that such vacation was not
the result of landlord harassment or pressure upon such vacating
tenant.
A. In the event that the owner of a multiple dwelling subject to rent control
converts the building from the rental market to a condominium or a
cooperative, a rental apartment unit within that multiple dwelling shall
remain under rent control if the tenant occupying that apartment began
his or her initial tenancy before the master deed or agreement
establishing the cooperative was recorded. That rental apartment shall

§ 347-19. Grease, oil and sand interceptor standards.
A. Grease traps at existing establishments.
(1) Grease traps are required for all waste outlets from all greaseproducing
establishments. The type of grease traps must be
approved by the Borough prior to installation in accordance with
the specifications.
(2) Each grease-producing establishment shall be required to control
oil and grease discharges, as follows:
(a) Where outside space permits the installation of a grease trap of
the type shown on Diagram A (attached hereto as Appendix
D136), an exterior grease trap shall be installed, sized as shown
below, and a bacterial pretreatment program shall be
developed and implemented.
(b) Where outside space does not permit the installation of an
exterior grease trap, an interior grease trap shall be installed,
and a bacterial pretreatment program shall be developed and
implemented. Such interior grease traps and pretreatment
program shall be approved by the Borough prior to installation
and implementation, respectively.
(c) No existing or new grease traps shall be installed adjacent to

(4) The following design method for the sizing of grease interceptors
has been developed and recommended for use by the International
Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials, under Uniform
Plumbing Code, Appendix H. The Borough has elected to adopt this
method for all future grease trap sizing, with the exceptions noted
below.
(a) Restaurants.
[1] The calculation of the required size of grease interceptors
to be installed in restaurants shall be as follows:
Number
of Meals
per Peak
Hour
x Waste
Flow
Rate
x Retention
Time
x Storage
Factor
= Interceptor
Size
(liquid
capacity)
[2] The following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
[a] Number of meals per peak hour. For restaurants:
multiply the number of seats by 60, divide by the
estimated time a patron takes to eat. A restaurant
which serves people quickly may have a seating time
from 30 minutes to 45 minutes. Another restaurant
may be the type for leisurely meals with a seating time
from 90 minutes to 120 minutes.
[b] Waste flow rate.
[i] With dishwashing machine: six-gallon (22.7 liter)
flow.
[ii] Without dishwashing machine: five-gallon (18.9
liter) flow.
137. Editor's The diagram, Appendix D, is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 347-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 347-19
1:651
[iii] Single-service kitchen: two-gallon (7.6 liter) flow.
[iv] Food waste disposer: one-gallon (3.8 liter) flow.
[c] Retention times.
[i] Commercial kitchen waste dishwasher: 2.5 hours.
[ii] Single-service kitchen, single serving: 1.5 hours.
[d] Storage factors.
[i] Fully equipped commercial kitchen:
[A] Eight-hour operation: 1.
[B] Sixteen-hour operation: 2.
[C] Twenty-four-hour operation: 3.
[ii] Single-service kitchen: 1.5.
(b) Other oil- or grease-producing establishments. Review by the
Borough of other grease-producing establishments will be
based on submitted data and required pretreatment to meet
the effluent standards.
(5) Exceptions to the above requirements will be considered on written
request to the Borough where the above formula requires a grease
trap in excess of 1,000 gallons. In this regard, the Borough will
permit the following:
(a) The Borough will permit the trial installation of a single
external one-thousand-gallon grease trap for restaurants
seating less than 100 persons, except for restaurants known to
produce exceptional quantities of grease and oil.
(b) The Borough will permit the trial installation of two external
one-thousand-gallon grease traps in series for restaurants
seating more than 100 persons or for restaurants known to
produce exceptional quantities of grease and oil.
(c) Reductions in these requirements will be considered if there
are no deep-fat fryers, minimal cooking, and minimal
dishwashing.
(6) It is the property owner's obligation to meet the discharge
concentration standards for oil and grease set forth in other
sections of these regulations. If subsequent tests show that the
discharge concentration standard is not being met, then the abovedescribed
design method shall apply and additional grease trap
capacity shall be furnished.
(7) Additional requirements are as follows:
§ 347-19 EDGEWATER CODE § 347-19
1:652
(a) The grease trap(s) shall be placed at a distance from the
structure sufficient to permit cooling and coagulation of oil and
grease within the grease trap.
(b) Piping must be arranged so that only kitchen wastes and
kitchen floor drains are tributary to the grease traps. Bathroom
facilities and all other waste outlets must bypass the grease
traps.
(c) Cleanouts must be provided between the building and the
grease traps, between grease traps in series, and (as a
sampling point) downstream of the last grease trap.
(d) The trap openings must be extended to the surface, using
minimum thirty-inch-diameter barrels, and topped with a
standard manhole frame and cover.
(e) Every installation shall be reviewed for uplift resistance, with
groundwater assumed to be at the surface.
(8) Installation of grease traps shall meet the recommendations of the
Uniform Plumbing Code, including locations, flow control and
venting. Grease trap installation will also require a plumbing
permit and compliance with municipal plumbing code regulations.
Sampling manholes for food service establishments shall be
installed downstream of the grease trap, but upstream of any
interconnection with bathroom sanitary service lines.
C. Grease trap maintenance.
(1) Each grease-producing establishment shall submit a grease trap
maintenance program to the Borough for approval, prior to
construction. The frequency of grease removal is dependent upon
the capacity of the interceptor and the quantity of grease in the
wastewater. Maintenance intervals may vary from once a week to
once in several weeks, but in no event less than once monthly.
When the grease removal interval has been determined for a
specific installation, regular cleaning at that interval is necessary
to maintain the rated efficiency of the interceptor. After the
accumulated grease and waste material has been removed, the
interceptor should be checked to make sure that the inlet, outlet
and air relief ports are clear of obstructions such as solidified
grease.
(2) The maintenance program must include provision for a bacterial
pretreatment program, using products, equipments and dosage as
approved by the Borough. Records must be kept of all maintenance
on grease traps. The record must be available for inspection by
Borough representatives, upon request during normal business
hours. The record shall include the following information: date,
time, description of work done, comments on the additional work
needed, quantity of grease removed, and names of personnel

defined herein, to the Edgewater publicly owned treatment works and the
system for collection and transmission of sewage originating in the Borough

The preliminary connection charge for each such connection shall be
collected by the Construction Official on behalf of the Borough, at the time
of issuance of a construction permit, as follows:

the Construction Official, or the Construction Official shall determine, that
the number of applicable units in the facility, as built, shall differ from the
number of said units originally certified by the applicant for the purposes
of the preliminary connection charge, in which case the final connection
charge shall be recomputed in accordance with the revised number of
units, and the excess of the final connection charge over the preliminary
connection charge shall be paid to the Borough within 30 days of such
determination, or the excess of the preliminary connection charge over the
final connection charge shall be refunded by the Borough within 30 days or
as soon thereafter as may be practicable.

gallons per day) shall be divided by 200; and
C. The quotient thereof [being the number of equivalent residential units
(ERUs) or portion thereof for the facility] shall be multiplied by the
connection charge then in effect for each ERU.

use of existing properties which result, based upon the application of the
information contained in Table A, in an increased flow from said facility;
provided, however, that for such a change of use, a connection charge,
computed as hereinabove set forth, shall be applied only to the extent of the
estimated increased flow from said facility.

ARTICLE IV
Sanitary Sewer Overflow Elimination Plan
[Added 6-18-2012 by Ord. No. 1473-2012]
§ 347-35. Intent and purpose.
The implementation of this article will aid the Borough by limiting and
reducing the inflow of additional water into the sanitary sewer systems. By
prohibiting the discharge of water from any roof, surface, ground, sump
pump, swimming pool, other natural precipitation, and other sources of
inflow into the Borough's sanitary sewer system, the Borough is seeking
to reduce costs as well as protect against other damaging effects. Further,
all water that enters the system must be treated at the sewage treatment
plant. Therefore, by reducing and eliminating this inflow of "clean water"
into the sanitary sewer system and the subsequent unnecessary treatment,
the expenses to the Borough and the citizens will be reduced and will assist
in protecting the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Borough.
§ 347-36. Prohibited discharges; disconnection of illicit
connections; fees.
A. Prohibited discharges. No person or entity shall discharge or cause to
be discharged any stormwater, groundwater, roof runoff, yard drainage,
yard fountain, swimming pool, pond, overflow, or any other substance
other than sanitary sewage into the sanitary sewer collection system.
No person, business or other entity shall discharge or cause to be
discharged any hazardous substances into any public sewers.
B. Amnesty period for disconnection.
(1) On or before December 31, 2012, any person, business, or other
entity who shall have a connection described above and who shall
voluntarily report said connection to the Borough, so that said illicit
connection shall be remedied, shall have any and all permit,
connection and inspection fees waived by the Borough. This waiver
of fees applies only to Borough fees, and does not include the actual
cost of remediation.
(2) After December 31, 2012, any person, business, or other entity who
shall have a connection described above, and shall fail to
voluntarily report such connection by December 31, 2012, shall be
liable for all permit fees, inspection fees, and connection fees as
required by the Borough, to remedy the illicit connection.
C. Manner of disconnection.
(1) Any property owner, tenant, landlord or other person with a
property interest who shall have a connection in violation of this
article, or not obtained a waiver pursuant to § 347-41, shall
immediately remove such connection and correct such situation. If
not removed or corrected within 120 calendar days after receiving
§ 347-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 347-36
1:661
§ 347-37. Inspections.
§ 347-38. Surcharge.
a notice of violation which has been personally delivered or
delivered via certified mail, the Borough shall impose a surcharge
in the amount provided for in § 347-38.
(2) All disconnections of said illicit connections shall be accomplished
by a complete and permanent method and performed in a
competent manner and approved and inspected by the Borough
Building Inspector, any Borough subcode inspector, Borough Fire
Code official and/or Borough Engineer. Any disconnection,
plugging, capping, rerouting, altering, or modifying must be done
in accordance with all applicable state and municipal building
codes.
(3) Upon issuance of the surcharge pursuant to § 347-38, if the
property owner, tenant, landlord, or other person with a property
interest remedies the illicit connection, said property owner,
tenant, landlord, or other person with a property interest shall call
the Borough's Building Department for an inspection of the
connection by the Borough's Building Inspector, a Borough
subcode inspector, Borough Fire Code official or Borough Engineer,
and upon certification that the illicit connection has been remedied,
the surcharge shall be lifted, beginning the month following the
inspection and certification. If, however, on a subsequent and
periodic inspection for which a property was subject to the
surcharge, the illicit connection exists, the surcharge amount as
provided for in § 347-38 shall be calculated from the previous
inspection date.
A. The Building Inspector, Borough Engineer, Borough Fire Code official
and/or a Borough subcode inspector, as long as they display the proper
credentials and identification, shall be permitted to request entrance to
any property for the purpose of inspecting, observing, testing and
sampling to confirm that there is no sump pump or other prohibited
discharge into the sanitary sewer system in accordance with this
chapter.
B. Any owner, tenant, landlord, or other person with a property interest
who shall refuse entrance to the Building Inspector, Borough Engineer,
Borough Fire Code official or Borough subcode inspector, shall
immediately become subject to the monthly surcharge noted in
§ 347-38 of this article. Said property shall remain subject to the
monthly surcharge until such time as an inspection is permitted to
ensure compliance by the Borough of all terms of this chapter.
A. A surcharge of $50 per month is hereby imposed upon every sewer
utility bill to property owners, tenants, landlords, or other persons with
a property interest for the following conditions:
§ 347-36 EDGEWATER CODE § 347-38
1:662
§ 347-39. Appeal of surcharge.
Any property owner who shall be assessed a surcharge pursuant to this
article shall have a right to appeal to the Municipal Court for the purposes
of proving compliance with this article.
§ 347-40. Municipal assistance.
The Borough shall assist and provide guidance to any property owner,
tenant, landlord, or other person with a property interest in remedying the
situation as it involves a matter of public concern to the resident's health,
safety and welfare of the community in remedying the illicit connection.
Except as specifically set forth in this article, all costs associated to comply
with this article shall be borne by the property owner, tenant, landlord, or
other person with a property interest.
§ 347-41. Waiver.
Any person, business, or other entity, who shall by inspection or voluntary
reporting be determined to be in violation of any section of this article, shall
be permitted to file for a waiver of the surcharge requirement of § 347-38,
if they can prove that they have exhausted all possible remedial measures.
Remedial measures include but are not limited to, the installation of a dry
well, the connection to a storm sewer, and/or use of one's own property
for discharge of the water so long as such discharge does not adversely
affect any neighboring property owner. Upon certification of the Building
Inspector and/or Borough Engineer, the person, business, or other entity
shall be granted such waiver, but only for such time as to when a remedy
becomes available. If such remedy is made available by the Borough, the
Borough shall notify the person, business, or other entity, that they shall
comply with this article within 120 days of receiving said notice. Failure to
comply will result in the imposition of a surcharge as per § 347-38.
(1) Not in compliance with this article.
(2) Refusal of properly inspection.
B. If the surcharge is not paid and received by the Borough of Edgewater,
a lien shall be imposed upon the property as per N.J.S.A. 40:14B-42.
C. Said surcharge shall remain on the property and sewer utility bill until
such time as the Borough Building Inspector or Borough Engineer
certifies that the property owner, tenant, landlord, or other person with
a property interest is in full compliance with this article.

§ 374-1. Scope and purpose.
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural best management practices
(BMPs). Structural BMPs should be integrated with nonstructural
stormwater management strategies and proper maintenance plans.
Nonstructural strategies include both environmentally sensitive site
design and source controls that prevent pollutants from being placed on
the site or from being exposed to stormwater. Source control plans
should be developed based upon physical site conditions and the origin,
nature, and the anticipated quantity or amount of potential pollutants.
Multiple stormwater management BMPs may be necessary to achieve
the established performance standards for water quality, quantity, and
groundwater recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for "major
development," as defined in § 374-2.
C. Applicability.
(1) This article shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for
the following major developments that require preliminary or final
site plan or subdivision review:
(a) Nonresidential major developments; and
(b) Aspects of residential major developments that are not
preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) This article shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the Borough of Edgewater.
D. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant
to this article are to be considered an integral part of development
approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule,
act, or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this article shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This article
is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinances, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law, except
that, where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different

contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental, or
safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater
management strategies identified under Subsection E(2) below into
the design of a particular project, the applicant shall identify the
strategy considered and provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:
(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;
(d) Minimize the decrease in the "time of concentration" from
preconstruction to post construction. "Time of concentration"
is defined as the time it takes for runoff to travel from the
hydraulically most distant point of the watershed to the point
of interest within a watershed;
(e) Minimize land disturbance including clearing and grading;
(f) Minimize soil compaction;
(g) Provide low-maintenance landscaping that encourages
retention and planting of native vegetation and minimizes the
use of lawns, fertilizers and pesticides;
(h) Provide vegetated open-channel conveyance systems
discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;
(i) Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site, in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
§ 374-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 374-4
1:707
[1] Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that satisfy Subsection E(3) below;
[2] Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash
and debris from drainage systems;
[3] Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain
spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and
[4] When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
(3) Site design features identified under Subsection E(2)(i)[2] above

to this standard, see Subsection E(3)(c) below.
(a) Grates.
[1] Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a
storm drain or surface water body under that grate:
[a] The New Jersey Department of Transportation
(NJDOT) bicycle-safe grate, which is described in
Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible
Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidelines (April 1996); or
[b] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square
inches, or is no greater than 0.5 inch across the
smallest dimension.
[2] Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer
bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces
include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways,
parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields,
open channels, and stormwater basin floors.
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
§ 374-4 EDGEWATER CODE § 374-4
1:708
area of no more than seven square inches, or be no greater
than two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in Subsection G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Subsections F and
G shall meet one of the following requirements:

measure approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in
perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
§ 374-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 374-4
1:709
address identified in § 374-8, or found on the Department's website
at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 374-5, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to post construction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area, or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with a Department-approved remedial action work
plan or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks
§ 374-4 EDGEWATER CODE § 374-4
1:710
for spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to "source material."
Source materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
down gradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 374-5, complete one of the
following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, post-construction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
post-construction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten-, and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the post-construction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
§ 374-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 374-4
1:711
site on which the proposed development or project is to
be constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
post-construction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at Section 2 shall be submitted to
the appropriate Soil Conservation District for review and approval
in accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. Such uses do not include the
development of land for the processing or sale of food and the
manufacturing of agriculturally related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in
stormwater runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the
developed site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater
management measures shall only be required for water quality
control if an additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being
proposed on a development site. The requirement to reduce TSS
does not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated
under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New
Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules,
N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specifically exempt under a
NJPDES permit from this requirement. The water quality design
storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in two hours. Water quality
calculations shall take into account the distribution of rain from the
water quality design storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation
of the volume of runoff may take into account the implementation
of nonstructural and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 374-8, or found on the Department's website
at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources of
technical guidance are listed in § 374-8. TSS reduction shall be
calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2
below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, P.O. Box 418 Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (A x B)/100
Where:
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of
both BMPs
A = TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second
BMP

TSS Percent Removal
Rate
Bioretention systems 90%
Constructed stormwater wetland 90%
Extended detention basin 40% to 60%
Infiltration structure 80%
Manufactured treatment device See § 374-6C
Sand filter 80%
Vegetative filter strip 60% to 80%
Wet pond 50% to 90%
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Subsections F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples of stormwater quality BMPs
are contained in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual, which may be obtained from the address
identified in § 374-8.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
§ 374-4 EDGEWATER CODE § 374-4
1:714
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or center
line of the waterway where the bank is undefined. All
encroachments proposed under this subsection shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the Standards For
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
Standard For Off-Site Stability in the Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under
the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et
seq., then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
subsection shall achieve a 95% TSS post-construction
removal rate;
§ 374-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 374-4
1:715
§ 374-5. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this subsection shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to Subsection G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in Subsection G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall
a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
special water resource protection area to less than 150 feet as
measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
§ 374-4 EDGEWATER CODE § 374-5
1:716
National Engineering Handbook Section 4  Hydrology and
Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds
or superseding document; or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at Subsection A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at Subsection A(1)(b). A runoff
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption
prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover has
existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the
time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the
presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the
land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land
use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and
conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32, A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
§ 374-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 374-5
1:717
§ 374-6. Standards for structural stormwater management
measures.
incorporated herein by reference, as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual; at
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/; or at New Jersey Geological
Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, P.O. Box 427, Trenton, New Jersey
08625-0427; (609) 984-6587.
A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one-inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of § 374-9D.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosionresistant.
Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
§ 374-9.
(6) Where tailwater will affect the hydraulic performance of a
stormwater management measure, the design engineer shall
include such effects in the measure's design.
B. Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
§ 374-5 EDGEWATER CODE § 374-6
1:718
§ 374-7. Nonstructural stormwater strategies.
The applicant shall comply with the following nonstructural stormwater
strategies to the greatest extent practicable in accordance with N.J.A.C.
7:8-5.3 and also with the Land Use Ordinance of the Borough of Edgewater,
Chapter 240, to address stormwater management.
stormwater management measures may be utilized, provided the
design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its
design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater
recharge and water quality design and performance standards
established by § 374-4 of this article.
C. Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements
of § 374-4 of this article, provided the pollutant removal rates are
verified by the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and
certified by the Department.
A. Buffers: Buffer areas are required along all lot and street lines
separating residential uses from arterial and collector streets,
separating a nonresidential use from either a residential use or
residential zoning district line, and along all street lines where loading
and storage areas can be seen from the street. The buffer area shall use
native vegetation, which requires less fertilization and watering than
non-native species. Buffer areas may be used for stormwater
management by disconnecting impervious surfaces and treating runoff
from these impervious surfaces. Preservation of natural wood tracts
and limiting land disturbance for new construction must be
incorporated where practical.
B. Curbs and gutters: Curb cuts or flush curbs with curb stops are
encouraged where practical to allow vegetated swales to be used for
stormwater conveyance and to allow the disconnection of impervious
areas where practical.
C. Drainage systems: All streets should be provided with inlets and pipes
where the same are necessary for proper drainage. The use of natural
vegetated swales in lieu of inlets and pipes is encouraged where
practical.
D. Driveways and accessways: The use of pervious paving materials to
minimize stormwater runoff and promote groundwater recharge should
be considered for driveways and accessways where practical.
Consideration should be given for subsurface soil conditions. The use of
crowned driveways is also encouraged to promote disconnectivity
between impervious surfaces and grass areas to promote groundwater
recharge.
E. Natural features: Natural features, such as trees, brooks, swamps,
hilltops, and views, are to be preserved whenever possible, and care
shall be taken to preserve selected trees to enhance soil stability and
§ 374-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 374-7
1:719
landscaped treatment of the area. In addition, forested areas shall be
maintained to ensure that leaf litter and other beneficial aspects of the
forest are maintained in addition to the trees.
F. Nonconforming uses, structures or lots: The applicant/owner of an
existing use may be allowed to propose additions or alterations that
exceed the permitted building and/or lot coverage percentages. The
applicant should mitigate the impact of the additional impervious
surfaces unless the stormwater management plan for the development
provided for these increases in impervious surfaces. This mitigation
effort must address water quality, flooding and groundwater recharge.
G. Off-site and off-tract improvements: Any off-site and off-tract
stormwater management and drainage improvements must conform to
the design and performance standards described.
H. Off-street parking and loading: Parking lots with more than 10 spaces
and all loading areas should allow for flush curb with curb stop, or
curbing with curb cuts to encourage developers to allow for the
discharge of impervious areas into landscaped areas for stormwater
management. The use of natural vegetated swales for the water quality
design storm, with overflow for larger storm events into storm sewers,
should be utilized where practical. A developer may demonstrate that
fewer spaces would be required, provided area is set aside for
additional spaces if necessary. Pervious paving could be provided
overflow parking areas.
I. Performance standards: Pollution source control must be evaluated in
order to prohibit materials or wastes from being deposited upon a lot in
such form or manner that they can be transferred off the lot, directly or
indirectly, by natural forces such as precipitation, evaporation or wind.
Materials and wastes that might create a pollutant or a hazard shall be
enclosed in appropriate containers.
J. Shade trees: A minimum amount of shade trees per lot to be planted in
the front yard may be required. In addition to this subsection, the

A. This section sets forth requirements to protect public safety through
the proper design and operation of stormwater management basins.
This section applies to any new stormwater management basin. The
provisions of this section do not preempt more stringent municipal or
county safety requirements for new or existing stormwater
management basins. Municipal and county stormwater management
plans and ordinances may, pursuant to their authority, require existing
stormwater management basins to be retrofitted to meet one or more of
the safety standards in Subsection B(1), (2) and (3) for trash racks,
overflow grates, and escape provisions at outlet structures.
B. Requirements for trash racks, overflow grates and escape provisions.
(1) A trash rack is a device designed to catch trash and debris and
prevent the clogging of outlet structures. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet from the stormwater
management basin to ensure proper functioning of the basin
outlets in accordance with the following:
(a) The trash rack shall have parallel bars, with no greater than
six-inch spacing between the bars.
(b) The trash rack shall be designed so as not to adversely affect
the hydraulic performance of the outlet pipe or structure.
(c) The average velocity of flow through a clean trash rack is not to
exceed 2.5 feet per second under the full range of stage and
discharge. Velocity is to be computed on the basis of the net
area of opening through the rack.
(d) The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be rigid,
durable, and corrosion-resistant, and shall be designed to
withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(2) An overflow grate is designed to prevent obstruction of the
overflow structure. If an outlet structure has an overflow grate,
such grate shall meet the following requirements:
(a) The overflow grate shall be secured to the outlet structure but
be removable for emergencies and maintenance.
§ 374-8 EDGEWATER CODE § 374-9
1:722
(b) The overflow grate spacing shall be no less than two inches
across the smallest dimension.
(c) The overflow grate shall be constructed and installed to be
rigid, durable, and corrosion-resistant, and shall be designed
to withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(3) For purposes of this Subsection B(3), "escape provisions" means
the permanent installation of ladders, steps, rungs, or other
features that provide easily accessible means of egress from
stormwater management basins. Stormwater management basins
shall include escape provisions as follows:
(a) If a stormwater management basin has an outlet structure,
escape provisions shall be incorporated in or on the structure.
With the prior approval of the reviewing agency identified in
Subsection C, a freestanding outlet structure may be exempted
from this requirement.
(b) Safety ledges shall be constructed on the slopes of all new
stormwater management basins having a permanent pool of
water deeper than 2 1/2 feet. Such safety ledges shall be
comprised of two steps. Each step shall be four feet to six feet
in width. One step shall be located approximately 2 1/2 feet
below the permanent water surface, and the second step shall
be located one foot to 1 1/2 feet above the permanent water
surface. See Subsection D for an illustration of safety ledges in
a stormwater management basin.
(c) In new stormwater management basins, the maximum interior
slope for an earthen dam, embankment, or berm shall not be
steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
C. Variance or exemption from safety standards. A variance or exemption
from the safety standards for stormwater management basins may be
granted only upon a written finding by the appropriate reviewing
agency (municipality, county or Department) that the variance or
exemption will not constitute a threat to public safety.
D. Illustration of safety ledges in a new stormwater management basin.

It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. Development of residential and nonresidential properties within the
Borough of Edgewater generally increases the volume of stormwater
runoff and the peak flow of the same.
B. The Borough of Edgewater's storm sewer collection system is impacted
by the increases in stormwater flows, which if unregulated will severely
impede the operation of the storm sewer system.
C. Stormwater runoff created by development and construction activities
which are not subject to Planning Board review is currently
unregulated.
D. It is in the best interests of the Borough of Edgewater to establish
limitations on stormwater runoff for:
(1) All applications involving the demolition of any single- and twofamily
residential structure for the purposes of constructing a new
single- or two-family residential structure;
(2) Any application for the expansion of an existing single- or twofamily
residential structure;
(3) Any application involving or creating additional impervious
coverage area; or
(4) Grading changes which would increase the quantity or peak rate of
stormwater discharge.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure, such as water,
sewer, gas, electric and other utility facilities, streets, bridges and other
public improvements; and
E. Help maintain a stable tax base by avoiding overutilization of municipal
stormwater facilities.

work for a period not to exceed one year from the date of completion,
provided that if the security deposit is in the form of a certified check,
the permittee may deposit a surety bond of $2,000 satisfactory to the
Borough Attorney to replace the certified check. If the security deposit
is greater than $2,000, then the Borough will release or refund the
security deposit with the approval of the Construction Official, upon the
posting of a surety maintenance bond in the amount of 15% of the
security deposit but not less than $2,000. All bonds posted for
