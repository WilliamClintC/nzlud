to the appropriate division of the general court of justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order
of abatement commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of
the property. The action shall be governed in all respects by the laws and rules governing civil proceedings,
including the State Rules of Civil Procedure in general and Rule 65 in particular.

the cause. An order of abatement may direct that buildings or other structures on the property be
closed, demolished, or removed; that fixtures, furniture, or other movable property be removed from
buildings on the property; that grass and weeds be cut; that improvements or repairs be made; or that
any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with this code or the
ordinance.
i. If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement
within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for contempt, and the town may
execute the order of abatement.
ii. The town shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement in
the nature of a mechanic's and materialman's lien.
b. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings
and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision
17
the Clerk of Superior Court in an amount approved by the Judge before whom the matter is heard and
shall be conditioned on the defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement
within a time fixed by the Judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel
an injunction issued in conjunction therewith.
(d) The provisions of this code and any other town ordinance may be enforced by any one, all, or a combination
of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this section.
(e) Except as otherwise specifically provided, each day's continuing violation of any provision of this code or any
other town ordinance shall be a separate and distinct offense.
(f) Any violation of any provision of this code or any other town ordinance shall subject the offender to a civil
penalty in the amount set by the Board of Commissioners. Violators shall be issued a written citation, which
must be paid within ten days. Each day’s continuing violation shall be a separate and distinct offense. The
Town Attorney is hereby authorized to file suit on behalf of the town to collect any unpaid citations and the
Town Manager is hereby authorized to verify and sign complaints on behalf of the town in such suits.

CHAPTER 3 – CODE OF ETHICS
SECTION 2-46. – PURPOSE.
The purpose of this Code of Ethics is to establish, in keeping with the General Statutes of the State of North Carolina,
guidelines for an ethical standard of conduct for the Red Springs Board of Commissioners (the “Board”) and to help
determine what conduct is appropriate in particular cases. It should not be considered a substitute for the law or for a
Board member’s best judgment.
State Law Reference— Ethics Codes and Education Program, G.S. § 160A-86.
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision
26
SECTION 2-47. – GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE CODE OF ETHICS.
a) The stability and proper operation of democratic representative government depend upon public confidence
in the integrity of the government and upon responsible exercise of the trust conferred by the people upon
their elected officials.
b) Governmental decisions and policy must be made and implemented through proper channels and processes
of the governmental structure.
c) Board members must be able to act in a manner that maintains their integrity and independence, yet is
responsive to the interests and needs of those they represent.
d) Board members must always remain aware that at various times they play different roles:
a. As advocates, who strive to advance the legitimate needs of their citizens;
b. As legislators, who balance the public interest and private rights in considering and enacting decisions,
ordinances, and resolutions; and
c. As decision-makers, who arrive at fair and impartial quasi-judicial and administrative determinations.
e) Board members must know how to distinguish among these roles, to determine when each role is appropriate,
and to act accordingly.
f) Board members must be aware of their obligation to conform their behavior to standards of ethical conduct
that warrant the trust of their constituents. Each official must find within his or her own conscience the
touchstone by which to determine what conduct is appropriate.
SECTION 2-48. – OBEY THE LAW.
Board members should obey all laws applicable to their official actions as members of the Board. Board members should
be guided by the spirit as well as the letter of the law in whatever they do.
SECTION 2-49. – ACT WITH CIVILITY.
Board members should feel free to assert policy positions and opinions without fear of reprisal from fellow Board
members or citizens. To declare that a Board member is behaving unethically because one disagrees with that Board
member on a question of policy (and not because of the Board member’s behavior) is unfair, dishonest, irresponsible,
and itself unethical.
SECTION 2-50. – MAINTAIN INTEGRITY AND INDEPENDENCE.
Board members should act with integrity and independence from improper influence as they exercise the duties of their
office. Characteristics and behaviors consistent with this standard include the following:
a) Adhering firmly to a code of sound values;
b) Behaving consistently and with respect toward everyone with whom they interact;
c) Exhibiting trustworthiness;
d) Living as if they are on duty as elected officials regardless of where they are or what they [are]
doing;
e) Using their best independent judgment to pursue the common good as they see it, presenting
their opinions to all in a reasonable, forthright, consistent manner;
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision
27
f) Remaining incorruptible, self-governing, and unaffected by improper influence while at the same
time being able to consider the opinions and ideas of others;
g) In a quasi-judicial matter, disclosing contacts and information about issues that they receive
outside of public meetings to the extent required by law;
h) In a quasi-judicial matter, refraining from seeking or receiving information about the matter
outside of the quasi-judicial proceeding itself to the extent required by law;
i) Treating other Board members and the public with respect and honoring the opinions of others
even when the Board members disagree with those opinions;
j) Not reaching conclusions on issues until all sides have been heard;
k) Showing respect for their office and not behaving in ways that reflect badly on those in office;
l) Recognizing that they are part of a larger group and acting accordingly; and
m) Recognizing that individual Board members are not generally allowed to act on behalf of the
Board but may only do so if the Board specifically authorizes it, and that the Board must take
official action as a body.
SECTION 2-51. – AVOID IMPROPER ACTS.
a) Board members should avoid impropriety in the exercise of their official duties. Their official
actions should be above reproach. Although opinions may vary about what behavior is
inappropriate, this Board will consider impropriety in terms of whether a reasonable person who
is aware of all of the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the Board member’s action
would conclude that the action was inappropriate.
b) If a Board member believes that his or her actions, while legal and ethical, may be
misunderstood, the member should seek the advice of the Town's attorney and should consider
publicly disclosing the facts of the situation and the steps taken to resolve it (such as consulting

different meaning.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the flood plain within a community subject to a 1% or greater chance
of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the flood hazard boundary map. After
detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the flood insurance rate map, Zone A
usually is refined into Zones A, AO, Al-99, VO, and VI-30.
BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings
or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations.
FLOOD or FLOODING.
(1) A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
(a) The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
(b) The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.

undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated
force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable
event which results in flooding as defined in division (1)(a) above.
FLOOD ELEVATION DETERMINATION. A determination by the Federal Insurance Administrator of the water surface
elevation of the base flood, that is, the flood level that has a 1% or greater chance of occurrence in any given
year.
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision

flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plan, flood control works, and flood plain
management regulations.
FLOOD RELATED EROSION. The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a
result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly
caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an
unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and
unforeseeable event which results in flooding.
FLOODWAY. See REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
REGULATORY FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be
reversed in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more

that is principally above ground, as well as a mobile home. STRUCTURE for insurance coverage purposes, means
a walled and roofed building, other than a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground and affixed
to a permanent site, as well as a mobile home on foundation. For the latter purpose, the term includes a building
while in the course of construction, alteration, or repair, but does not include building materials or supplies
intended for use in such construction, alteration, or repair, unless such materials or supplies are within an
enclosed building on the premises.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure either, before the improvement or repair is started, or if the

located in a locally designated historic district or in a historic district listed in the National
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision
70
Register of Historic Places and the town council determines, after a public hearing as
provided by ordinance, that the nonresidential building or structure is of individual
significance or contributes to maintaining the character of the district, and the
nonresidential building or structure has not been condemned as unsafe, the order may
require that the nonresidential building or structure be vacated and closed until it is
brought into compliance with the minimum standards established in this article.
(2) An order may not require repairs, alterations, or improvements to be made to vacant
manufacturing facilities or vacant industrial warehouse facilities to preserve the original
use. The order may require such building or structure to be vacated and closed, but repairs
may be required only when necessary to maintain structural integrity or to abate a health
or safety hazard that cannot be remedied by ordering the building or structure closed for
any use.
(e) Action by town council upon failure to comply with order.
(1) If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter, or improve or to vacate and
close the nonresidential building or structure, the town council may adopt an ordinance
ordering the code enforcement official to cause such building or structure to be repaired,
altered or improved in order to bring it into compliance with the minimum standards
established by this article or to be vacated and closed for any use. The property or
properties shall be described in the ordinance. The ordinance shall be recorded in the
office of the register of deeds and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner or
owners in the grantor index. Following adoption of an ordinance, the code enforcement
official may cause the building or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be
vacated and closed. The code enforcement official may cause to be posted on the main
entrance of any nonresidential building or structure so closed a placard with the following
words: "This building is unfit for any use; the use or occupation of this building for any
purpose is prohibited and unlawful." Any person who occupies or knowingly allows the
occupancy of a building or structure so posted shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor.
(2) If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the nonresidential
building or structure, the town council may adopt an ordinance ordering the code
enforcement official to cause such building or structure to be removed or demolished.
No ordinance shall be adopted to require removal or demolition of a nonresidential
building or structure until the owner has first been given a reasonable opportunity to
bring it into conformity with the minimum standards established in this article. The
property or properties shall be described in the ordinance. The ordinance shall be
recorded in the office of the register of deeds and shall be indexed in the name of the
property owner or owners in the grantor index. Following adoption of an ordinance, the

(1) If the town council has adopted an ordinance or the code enforcement official has issued
an order requiring the building or structure to be repaired or vacated and closed and the
building or structure has been vacated and closed for a period of two years pursuant to
the ordinance or order, the town council may make findings that the owner has
abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter, or improve the building or structure
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision
71
and that the continuation of the building or structure in its vacated and closed status
would be inimical to the health, safety, and welfare of the town in that it would continue
to deteriorate, would create a fire or safety hazard, would be a threat to children and
vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities, or would cause or contribute
to blight and the deterioration of property values in the area. Upon such findings, the
town council may, after the expiration of the two-year period, enact an ordinance and
serve such ordinance on the owner, setting forth the following:
a. If the cost to repair the nonresidential building or structure to bring it into
compliance with the minimum standards is less than or equal to 50 percent of its
then current value, the ordinance shall require that the owner either repair or
demolish and remove the building or structure within 90 days; or
b. If the cost to repair the nonresidential building or structure to bring it into
compliance with the minimum standards exceeds 50 percent of its then current
value, the ordinance shall require the owner to demolish and remove the building
or structure within 90 days.
In the case of vacant manufacturing facilities or vacant industrial warehouse facilities, the building
or structure must have been vacated and closed pursuant to an order or ordinance for a period
of five years before the town council may take action under this subsection. The ordinance shall
be recorded in the office of the register of deeds in the county wherein the property or properties
are located and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index.
(2) If the owner fails to comply with the ordinance, the code enforcement official shall cause the
building or structure to be removed or demolished.

CHAPTER 4 –NONCONFORMING USES
SECTION 11-41. - SUBSTANDARD LOTS OF RECORD
After the effective date of this Ordinance, preexisting lots or structures, or uses of lots or structures, which would be prohibited
under the regulations for the district in which located, shall be considered as nonconforming. Nonconforming lots, structures, or
uses may be continued provided they conform to the following provisions.
Any lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance, which has an area or width which is less than required
by this Ordinance, shall be subject to the following exceptions and modifications:
a. Adjoining and Vacant Lots of Record. If two (2)or more adjoining and vacant lots of record are in a single ownership
at any time after the adoption of this Ordinance and such lots individually have less frontage or area than the minimum
requirements of the district in which such lots are located, the land involved shall be considered to be an undivided
parcel for the purposes of this Ordinance, and no portion of said parcel shall be used which does not meet lot width and
area requirements established by this Ordinance, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining
any lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this Ordinance.
b. Lot Not Meeting Lot Size Requirements. Except as set forth in (a) above, if a lot, which was recorded prior to the
passage of this Ordinance, fails to meet lot area or width requirements or both in a district where single family residences
are permitted, such lot may be used as the location of a single-family dwelling with related accessory buildings. There
shall be no alteration of minimum yard requirements on such lots except where the Board of Adjustments finds, after
public hearing, that the value of neighboring properties would not be unduly depreciated nor the public safety or
welfare unduly affected by such action. In no case shall the Board of Adjustment reduce the yard requirements by more
than 40 percent.
SECTION 11-42. - EXTENSION OF NONCONFORMING USES
Nonconforming portions of buildings shall not hereafter be enlarged or extended in any way, provided, that a building which is
nonconforming solely because of its encroachment in a required yard area may be extended
in any lawful manner that does
not further encroach in that yard.
SECTION 11-43. - CHANGE OF NONCONFORMING USES
Any nonconforming' use may be changed to any conforming use, or with the approval of the Board of Adjustment, to any use more
in character with the uses permitted in the district. In permitting such change, the Board of Adjustment may require
appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
SECTION 11-44. - CESSATION OF NONCONFORMING USES
If active operations of a nonconforming use are discontinued for a continuous period of one hundred and eighty (180) days
such nonconforming use shall thereafter be used only for a conforming use.
SECTION 11-45. - DESTRUCTION OF NONCONFORMING USES
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision
203
If a nonconforming structure or a structure occupied by a nonconforming use is destroyed by any means to an extent of more
than 50 percent of its assessed valuation at the time of destruction, such structure may not be restored as a nonconforming
structure or for a nonconforming use. If destroyed by less than 50 percent but not restored
within 24 months of the time such
damage occurred, it may not be1 restored as a nonconforming structure or for a nonconforming use.
SECTION 11-46. - REPAIR AND ALTERATION OF NONCONFORMING USES
Normal maintenance and repair in a building occupied by a nonconforming use is permitted provided it does not increase the
bulk of the structure nor extend the nonconforming use.

CHAPTER 5 –GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION 11-51. – SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS
The Supplemental Regulations contained in this ordinance under Title 4, Chapter 4 shall apply to uses in all zoning districts.
SECTION 11-52. - NEWLY INCORPORATED AREAS
All territory which may hereafter be included within the zoning jurisdiction of the Town of Red Springs shall be zoned
by the Board of Commissioners at the time of such incorporation.
SECTION 11-53. - LOT OF RECORD
Where the owner of a lot at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance or his successor in title thereto does not own
sufficient land to enable him to conform to the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance (lot area, lot width or
setback requirements), the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall allow such lot to be used as a building site in the district in
which it is located; provided, that the lot width, lot area or setback requirements are not more than twenty (20) percent
below the minimum specified in this Ordinance. In any case where the dimensional requirements are more than twenty
(20) percent below the minimum specified in this Ordinance, the Board of Adjustment may approve, as a special
exception, such dimensions as shall conform as closely as possible to the required dimensions.
SECTION 11-54. - ADJOINING AND VACANT LOTS OF RECORD
If two (2) or more adjoining and vacant lots of record are in a single ownership at any time after the adoption of this
Ordinance and such lots individually have less frontage or area than the minimum requirements of the district in which
such a single lot or several lots are located, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the
purposes of this Ordinance, and no portion of said parcel shall be used which does not meet lot width and area
requirements established by this Ordinance, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot
with width or area below the requirements stated in this Ordinance.
SECTION 11-55. - MANUFACTURED HOMES TO BE UNDERPINNED
In order to insure public safety and welfare, every mobile home located in the Town of Red Springs at the time of the
passage of this ordinance will, within one year, be underpinned with materials approved by and in a manner approved
by the Zoning Enforcement Officer. Materials should be manufactured specifically as mobile home underpinning

204
Enforcement Officer along with the town staff, will notify each manufactured home owner of this requirement, and
insure compliance within one year.
SECTION 11-56. - VESTED RIGHTS
The purpose of this section is to implement provisions of G.S.160A-385.1 which establishes a statutory zoning vested
right upon the approval of a site specific development plan.
(a). General:
1) At the time that the landowner submits application for a conditional land use permit, the
landowner must declare he is seeking to acquire a vested right pursuant to G.S. 160A-385.1
and the Town of Red Springs Zoning Ordinance by completing the accompanying form.
2) The Planning Board will schedule the public hearing.
3) A variance shall not constitute a site specific development plan, and approval of a site specific
development plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall not confer a vested
right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained.
4) Neither a sketch plan nor any other document which fails to describe with reasonable
certainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel of parcels of property may
constitute a site specific development plan.
(b). Establishment of Vested Right:
1) A vested right shall be deemed established upon the valid approval, or conditional approval
of the conditional use permit. Such vested right shall confer upon the landowner the right to
undertake and complete the development and use of said property under the terms and
conditions of the subdivision plat, or conditional use permit.
2) A right which has been vested as provided for in this section shall remain vested for a permit
of two years. This vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications unless
expressly provided by the town.
(c). Termination of a Vested Right:
A right which has been vested as provided in this section shall terminate at the end of the applicable vesting
period with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed.
An established vested right runs with the land.
(d). Changes and Exceptions:
A vested right, once established as provided for in this section, precludes any zoning action by the town
which would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the
property as set forth in an approved site specific development plan except:
1) With written consent of the affected landowner.
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision
205
2) Upon findings that natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the
property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare
if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the site specific development plan.
3) To the extent that the affected landowner receives compensation for all costs and losses.
4) Upon findings that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate
information or made material misrepresentations which made a difference in the plan
approval by the town.
5) Upon the enactment of a State of federal law or regulation which precludes development as
contemplated in the site specific development plan.
SECTION 11-57. – DETERMINING WHAT IS A PERMITTED OR CONDITIONAL USE
If required to distinguish whether a use is permitted by right or is a conditional use and subject to a conditional use
permit, the Code Administrator shall use the following:
The Code Administrator shall first determine the form and function of the use. When a proposed use is not specifically
listed in the table of uses for each district, the Code Administrator shall determine if the use is the same as, or manifestly
similar to, a listed use in form and function. If the Code Administrator finds that the proposed use is the same as, or
manifestly similar to, a listed use, he shall classify the proposed use as the listed use. In doing so the Code Administrator
may consult the North American Industry Classification System published by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.
If the Code Administrator finds that a proposed use is not the same as, or is not manifestly similar to, a listed use, he
shall classify the proposed use as not permitted.
SECTION 11-58. – DETERMINING THE PRIMARY USE ON A LOT
If required to distinguish the primary use on a lot, the Code Administrator shall use the following:
The principal use shall be considered as the primary purpose or function that a lot or structure serves or is proposed to
serve. An accessory use shall be considered a structure or use that: (1) is clearly incidental to and customarily found in
connection with a principal building or use; (2) is subordinate to and serves a principal building or a principal use; (3) is
subordinate in area, extent, or purpose to the principal building or principal use served; (4) contributes to the comfort,
convenience, or necessity of occupants, business, or industry in the principal building or principal use served; and (5) is
located on the same lot and zoned the same as the principal building or use served. Two or more principal uses may, in
some cases, be permitted to occupy the same land or building as long as each use is a permitted use.
SECTION 11-59. - PENALTY
Any violations of any provisions of this code or any other Town ordinance shall subject the offender to a civil penalty in
the amount of fifty ($50) dollars. Violators shall be issued a written citation, which must be paid within ten (10) days.
Each day’s continuing violation shall be a separate and distinct offense. The Town Attorney is hereby authorized to file
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision
206
suit on behalf of the town to collect any unpaid citations and the Town Manager is hereby authorized to verify and sign
complaints on behalf of the town to such suits. (Ord. 9-6-2005)

CHAPTER 11 – CONDITIONAL USES
SECTION 11-146. - PURPOSE
The development and execution of this ordinance is based on the division of the Town of Red Springs into districts within
which the use and location of land and buildings are substantially uniform. As can be seen from the tables contained in
each district description under this Title, there are uses which are permitted by right, designated by a “P”. This Ordinance
also recognizes and allows some uses in these districts as a “conditional” use. Conditional uses are land uses which are
basically in keeping with the intent and purposes of the district, but which may have an impact on the area around them
which can only be determined by review of the specific proposal. These uses may be established, under certain
conditions and with proper controls, in such a manner as to minimize any adverse effects. In order to insure that these
uses, in their proposed locations, would be compatible with surrounding development and in keeping with the purposes
of the district in which they are located, their establishment shall not be as a matter of right, but only after review and
approval of a Conditional Use Permit preceded by a Public Hearing.
Recognizing the specific nature of some uses within certain district, those uses shall be subject to the Supplemental
Regulations contained in this Ordinance under Title 4.
SECTION 11-147. - APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL USE
Applications for Conditional Use Permits, signed by the applicant, shall be addressed to the Board of Commissioners. A
fee as posted in the Town Clerk's office shall be paid to the Town of Red Springs for each application to cover the costs
of advertising and administrative costs. Each application shall contain or be accompanied by such legal descriptions,
maps, site plan, plans and other information so as to completely describe the proposed use and existing conditions. The
Code Administrator shall notify the Planning Board Chairman of the application upon receipt.
(a) A conditional use permit application shall be filed with the Code Administrator at least twenty (20) calendar
days prior to the meeting at which the application will be heard.
(b) No application shall be deemed complete unless it contains or is accompanied by a site plan drawn to scale.
(c) One (1) hard copy of the application, and all attachments and maps, for a conditional use permit shall be
submitted to the Code Administrator.
(d) The applicant shall provide to the Code Administrator a list of names and addresses of all adjacent property
owners, at least eight (8) days prior to the public hearing. The Code Administrator shall then mail a copy of the
legal notice to each adjacent property owner.

SECTION 11-148. - ACTION BY THE PLANNING BOARD
The Planning Board shall review the application. The Planning Board shall approve, modify or deny the application for
Conditional Use Permit following the hearing.
(a) The Planning Board may, in its review, suggest reasonable conditions to the location, nature, and
extent of the proposed use and its relationship to surrounding properties, parking areas, driveways,
pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems, screening and landscaping, timing of development, and
any other conditions the Planning Board may find appropriate. The conditions may include dedication
of any rights-of-way or easements for streets, water, sewer, or other public utilities necessary to serve
the proposed development.
(b) The Planning Board may not, however, in accordance with NC Gen Stat. §160A-381 apply conditions

271
use application by the Planning Board shall not be a quasi-judicial procedure. Comments of the
Planning Board shall be considered with other evidence submitted at the public hearing.
In recommending the granting of a Conditional Use Permit the Planning Board shall make written findings that the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located are fulfilled. With due regard to the nature and state of all
adjacent structures and uses, the district within which same is located, and official plans for future development, the
Planning Board shall also make written findings that the following provisions are fulfilled:
(a) The use requested is listed among the conditional uses in the district for which application is made; or is similar
in character to those listed in that district; and
(b) The requested use is essential or desirable to the public convenience or welfare; and
(c) The requested use will not impair the integrity or character of the surrounding or adjoining districts, nor be
detrimental to the health, morals, or welfare; and
(d) The requested use will be in conformity with the Land Development Plan; and
(e) Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, sanitation and/or other necessary facilities have been or are being
provided; and
(f) That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize
traffic congestion in the public streets; and
(g) That the conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable regulations of the
district in which it is located.
SECTION 11-149. - PUBLIC HEARING BY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
The Mayor, through the Code Administrator, shall schedule a public hearing on the application for a Conditional Use
Permit to be held within 60 days after the application is filed. Public notice of the hearing shall be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the town at least once each week for two successive weeks prior to the public
hearing. The notice shall be published for the first time not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty-five (25) days before
the date fixed for the hearing. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall also post notice on the property involved for a
period of one week prior to the hearing.
SECTION 11-150. – ACTION BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
After approval by the Planning Board, or upon appeal after denial by the Planning Board, the request shall be submitted
to the Board of Commissioners for final approval. No Conditional Use Permit shall be issued until after review and
approval by the Board of Commissioners. Consideration of conditional use permits by the Board of Commissioners are
quasi-judicial decisions approved by a simple majority vote.
Once the comments of the Planning Board have been made, or the 45-day period elapses without a recommendation,
the Town Council shall hold a public hearing to consider the application at its next regularly scheduled meeting. A
quorum of the Town Council is required for this hearing. For the purposes of this section, vacant positions on the Town
Board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasijudicial matter shall not be considered “members of the
Board” for calculation of the requisite majority if there are no qualified alternates available to take the place of such
members.
In approving an application for a conditional use permit in accordance with the principles, conditions, safeguards, and
procedures specified herein, the Town Council may impose reasonable and appropriate conditions and safeguards upon
the approval. The petitioner will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any additional requirements
prior to approval or denial by the Town Council.
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision
272
The applicant has the burden of producing competent, material and substantial evidence tending to establish the facts
and conditions which the subsection below requires.
The Town Council shall issue a conditional use permit if it has evaluated an application through a quasi-judicial process
and determined that:
(a) The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the conditional use will not be detrimental to or
endanger the public health, safety, or general welfare.
(b) The conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate
vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor diminish or impair property values within the
neighborhood.
(c) The establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal and orderly development and
improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district.
(d) The exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of any proposed structure will not be so at
variance with either the exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of the structures already
constructed or in the course of construction in the immediate neighborhood or the character of the
applicable district, as to cause a substantial depreciation in the property values within the
neighborhood.
(e) Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, parking, or necessary facilities have been or are being
provided.
(f) Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to
minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
(g) The conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to all the applicable regulations of the district
in which it is located.
(h) Public access shall be provided in accordance with the recommendations of the town’s land use plan
and access plan or the present amount of public access and public parking as exists within the town
now. If any recommendations are found to conflict, the system requiring the greatest quantity and
quality of public access, including parking, shall govern.
In the event that a rezoning is sought in conjunction with a conditional use permit, such deliberation would be legislative
in nature and not part of the quasi-judicial process.
SECTION 11-151. - CONDITIONS AND GUARANTEES
Prior to the granting of any conditional use, the Planning Board may recommend, and the Board of Commissioners may
stipulate, such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, reconstruction, maintenance, and
operation of the conditional use as it deemed necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith
are being and will be met, provided that they comply with subsections 10-149(b) and (c) above.
(a) Such conditions may include a time limitation; and
(b) Conditions may be imposed which require that one or more things be done before the use requested can be
initiated. For example, "that a solid board fence be erected around the site to a height of six (6) feet
before the use requested is initiated"; and
(c) Conditions of a continuing nature may be imposed. For example, "exterior loud speakers shall not be used
between hours of 10:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m."

contracts for the construction of the main building have been let; or in the absence of contracts that the main
building is under construction to a substantial degree; or that prerequisite conditions involving substantial
investment are contracted for, in substantial development, or completed (sewerage, drainage, etc.). When
construction is not a part of the use, "exercised" shall mean that the use is in operation in compliance with the
condition set forth in the permit.
(h) Duration: Any conditions imposed in a conditional use authorized and exercised shall be perpetually binding
upon the property unless expressly limited by the Conditional Use Permit or subsequently changed or amended
by the Planning Board after a public hearing.

CHAPTER 12 – SOLAR ENERY FACILITY
SECTION 11-156. - PURPOSE.
The purpose of this ordinance is to facilitate the construction, installation, and operation of Solar Energy Systems (SESs)
in the Town of Red Springs in a manner that promotes economic development and ensures the protection of health,
safety, and welfare while also avoiding adverse impacts to important areas such as agricultural lands, endangered
species habitats, conservation lands, and other sensitive lands. It is the intent of this ordinance to encourage the
development of SESs that reduce reliance on foreign and out-of-state energy resources, bolster local economic
development and job creation, support the diversification of the state’s energy portfolio, strengthen energy and grid
security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce local air and water pollution, and aid North Carolina in meeting its
Renewable Portfolio Standard. This ordinance is not intended to abridge safety, health or environmental requirements
contained in other applicable codes, standards, or ordinances. The provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to
nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law.
SECTION 11-157. – DEFINITIONS.
Solar Energy System (SES) - the components and subsystems required to convert solar energy into electric or thermal
energy suitable for use. The area of the system includes all the land inside the perimeter of the system, which extends
to any fencing. The term applies, but is not limited to, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, solar thermal systems, and solar
hot water systems. A system fits into one of three system types: Level 1 SES, Level 2 SES, and Level 3 SES.
(a) Level 1 Solar Energy System - Level 1 SESs include the following:
1. Roof-mounted on any code-compliant structure.
2. Ground-mounted on an area of up to 50% of the footprint of the primary structure on the parcel but
no more than 1 acre.
3. Covering permanent parking lot and other hardscape areas.
4. Building integrated solar (i.e., shingle, hanging solar, canopy, etc.).
5.
(b) Level 2 Solar Energy System - Level 2 SESs are ground-mounted systems not included in Level 1 that meet the
area restriction listed below:
1. Agricultural-Residential: SES =1/2 acres
2. Residential: SES =1/2 acre
3. Residential Mobile Home/Residential Mobile Home-1: SES =1/2 acre
4. Residential Multi-Family: SES =1/2 acre
5. General Business/General Business-1/Central Business: SES =10 acres
6. Office and Professional: SES =1/2 acre
7. Industrial: SES of any size
(c) Level 3 Solar Energy System – Level 3 SESs are systems that do not satisfy the parameters for a Level 1 or Level
2 Solar Energy System.
SECTION 11-158. – APPLICABILITY.
(a) This ordinance applies to the construction of any new SES within the jurisdiction of the Town.
(b) An SES established prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall remain exempt:
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision
275
a. Exception: Modifications to an existing SES that increases the SES area by more than 5% of the original
footprint or changes the solar panel type (e.g. photovoltaic to solar thermal) shall be subjected to this
ordinance.
(c) Maintenance and repair are not subject to this ordinance.
(d) This ordinance does not supersede regulations from local, state, or federal agencies. Some important examples
of such regulations include, but are not limited to:
1. Building/Electrical Permits Required
Nothing in this ordinance modifies already established building standards required to
construct a SES.
2. Onsite Wastewater System Avoidance
Nothing in this ordinance modifies already established Department of Health and Human
Services requirements. A SES shall not be constructed over onsite waste water systems (e.g.
septic systems) unless approved by the Department of Health and Human Services.
3. Stormwater Permit Required
Nothing in this ordinance modifies the requirements or exempts any SES of complying with
the various stormwater jurisdictions and regulations established by the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources. North Carolina statute requires the acquisition of
stormwater permits for construction projects that impact stormwater runoff.

Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision
283
i. Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the Ordinance. It shall not
be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be
made of the property.
ii. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size,
or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships
resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may
not be the basis for granting a variance.
iii. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The
act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the
granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.
iv. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the Ordinance,
such that public safety is secured and substantial justice is achieved.
(c) No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance. Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any
variance, provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance. Any other ordinance that
regulates land use or development may provide for variances consistent with the provisions of this subsection.
(d) The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on the face of the zoning permit,
or the zoning permit may simply note the issuance of the variance and refer to the written record of the
variance for further information. All such conditions are enforceable in the same manner as any other
applicable requirement of this Ordinance.
State Law Reference – NC Gen Stat. §160A-388(d).
SECTION 11-182. - APPEALS.
(a) Any person who has standing under GS 160A-393(d) or the town may appeal a decision to the Board
of Adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal with the Town Clerk. The notice of appeal
shall state the grounds for the appeal. A notice of appeal shall be considered filed with the Town Clerk
when delivered to the Town Hall, and the date and time of filing shall be entered on the notice by the
town staff.
(b) The official who made the decision shall give written notice to the owner of the property that is the
subject of the decision and to the party who sought the decision, if different from the owner. The
written notice shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail.
(c) The owner or other party shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the written notice within which to
file an appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal shall have thirty (30) days from receipt from
any source of actual or constructive notice of the decision within which to file an appeal.
(d) It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to appeal have constructive notice of
the decision from the date a sign containing the words “Zoning Decision” or “Subdivision Decision” in
letters at least six inches high and identifying the means to contact an official for information about
the decision is prominently posted on the property for at least ten (10) days. Posting of signs is not
the only form of constructive notice. Any such posting shall be the responsibility of the landowner or
applicant. Verification of the posting shall be provided to the official who made the decision. Absent
an ordinance provision to the contrary, posting of signs shall not be required.
(e) The official who made the decision shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment all documents and
exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is taken. The official shall also
provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of
the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision
284
(f) An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement of the action
appealed from unless the official who made the decision certifies to the Board of Adjustment after
notice of appeal has been filed that because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause
immediate peril to life or property or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would
seriously interfere with enforcement of the Ordinance. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall
not be stayed except by a restraining order which may be granted by a court. If enforcement
proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing
of the appeal, and the Board of Adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within fifteen (15) days after
such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting permit or
otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the Ordinance shall not stay
the further review of an application for permits or permissions to use such property; in these
situations, the appellant may request and the Board of Adjustment may grant a stay of a final decision
of permit applications or building permits affected by the issue being appealed.
(g) Subject to the provisions of subsection 10-177(f), the Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide the
appeal within a reasonable time.
(h) The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing as a witness. The appellant shall not
be limited at the hearing to matters stated in the notice of appeal. If any party or the town would be
unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the Board of
Adjustment shall continue the hearing. The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm (wholly or
partly) or may modify the decision appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or
determination that ought to be made. The Board of Adjustment shall have all the powers of the official
who made the decision.
(i) When hearing an appeal pursuant to GS 160A-400.9(e) or any other appeal in the nature of certiorari,
the hearing shall be based on the record below and the scope of review shall be as provided in GS
160A-393(k).
(j) The parties of an appeal that has been made under this subsection may agree to mediation or other
forms of alternative dispute resolution. The Ordinance may set standards and procedures to facilitate
and manage such voluntary alternative dispute resolution.
State Law Reference – NC Gen Stat. §160A-388(b1).
SECTION 11-183. - INTERPRETATIONS.
(a) The Board of Adjustment is authorized to interpret the zoning map and to act upon disputed questions of lot
lines or district boundary lines and similar questions. If such questions arise in the context of an appeal from a
decision of the Code Administrator, they shall be handled as provided in Section 10-177.
(b) An application for a map interpretation shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustment by filing an appeal form
with Code Administrator. The application shall contain sufficient information to enable the Board of
Adjustment to make the necessary interpretation.
(c) Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the rules of
interpretation shall be applied. Where uncertainties continue to exist after application of the above rules,

DEFINITIONS FOR FACILITIES PROVIDING HEALTH-RELATED CARE

understanding of the many types of health care facilities which may already exist in the town or may apply for permits
to locate in the town.
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision

Adult Care Home
Adult care home is an assisted living residence in which the housing management
provides 24-hour scheduled and unscheduled personal care services to two or more
residents, either directly or, for scheduled needs, through formal written agreement
with licensed home care or hospice agencies. Some licensed adult care homes
provide supervision to persons with cognitive impairments whose decisions, if made
independently, may jeopardize the safety or well-being of themselves or others and
therefore require supervision. Medication in an adult care home may be
administered by designated, trained staff. Adult care homes that provide care to two
to six unrelated residents are commonly called family care homes. (G.S. 131D-2.1
, G.S. 131D-20 )
Adult care home as distinguished from a nursing home, means a facility operated as a
part of a nursing home and which provides residential care for aged or disabled
persons whose principal need is a home with the shelter or personal care their age or
disability requires. Medical care in an adult care home is usually occasional or
incidental, such as may be required in the home of any individual or family, but the
administration of medication is supervised. Continuing planned medical and nursing
care to meet the resident's needs may be provided under the direct supervision of a
physician, nurse or home health agency. Adult care homes are to be distinguished
from nursing homes subject to licensure under this part. (G.S. 131E-101 )
Adult care home means a facility with seven or more beds licensed under Part 1 of
Article 1 of Chapter 131D of the General Statutes or G.S. Chapter 131E that
provides residential care for aged or disabled persons whose principal need is a home
which provides the supervision and personal care appropriate to their age and
disability and for whom medical care is only occasional or incidental. (G.S. 131E-
176 )
Adult Day Care
Program
Adult day care program means the provision of group care and supervision in a place
other than their usual place of abode on a less than 24-hour basis to adults who may
be physically or mentally disabled. The Department of Health and Human Services
shall annually inspect and certify all adult day care programs, under rules adopted by
the Social Services Commission. The Social Services Commission shall adopt rules to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of persons in adult day care programs. These
rules shall include minimum standards relating to management of the program,
staffing requirements, building requirements, fire safety, sanitation, nutrition, and
program activities. Adult day care programs are not required to provide
transportation to participants; however, those programs that choose to provide
transportation shall comply with rules adopted by the Commission for the health and
safety of participants during transport. (G.S. 131D-6 )
Ambulatory Surgical
Facility
Ambulatory surgical facility means a facility designed for the provision of a specialty
ambulatory surgical program or a multispecialty ambulatory surgical program. An
ambulatory surgical facility serves patients who require local, regional or general
anesthesia and a period of post-operative observation. An ambulatory surgical facility
may only admit patients for a period of less than 24 hours and must provide at least
one designated operating room or at least one gastrointestinal endoscopy room and
at least one designated recovery room, have available the necessary equipment and
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision
301
trained personnel to handle emergencies, provide adequate quality assurance and
assessment by an evaluation and review committee, and maintain adequate medical
records for each patient. An ambulatory surgical facility may be operated as a part of
a physician or dentist's office, provided the facility is licensed under G.S. Chapter
131E, Article 6, Part 4 , but the performance of incidental, limited ambulatory
surgical procedures which do not constitute an ambulatory surgical program and
which are performed in a physician or dentist's office does not make that office an
ambulatory surgical facility. (G.S. 131E-146 , G.S. 131E-176 )
Assisted Living
Residence
Assisted living residence means any group housing and services program for two or
more unrelated adults, by whatever name it is called, that makes available, at a
minimum, one meal a day and housekeeping services and provides personal care
services directly or through a formal written agreement with one or more licensed
home care or hospice agencies. The department may allow nursing service
exceptions on a case-by-case basis. Settings in which services are delivered may
include self-contained apartment units or single or shared room units with private or
area baths. Assisted living residences are to be distinguished from nursing homes
subject to provisions of G.S. 131E-102 . Effective October 1, 2005, there are two
types of assisted living residences: adult care homes and adult care homes that serve
only elderly persons. Elderly person means:
a. Any person who has attained the age of 55 years or older and requires
assistance with activities of daily living, housing, and services, or
b. Any adult who has a primary diagnonsis of Alzheimer's disease or other form
of dementia who requires assistance with activities of daily living, housing,
and services provided by a licensed Alzheimer's and dementia care unit.
Effective July 1, 1996, there is a third type, multiunit assisted housing with services.

Chemical Dependency
Treatment Facility
Chemical dependency treatment facility means a public or private facility, or unit in a
facility, which is engaged in providing 24-hour a day treatment for chemical
dependency or substance abuse. This treatment may include detoxification,

Family Care Home Family care home means an adult care home having two to six residents. The structure
of a family care home may be no more than two stories high and none of the aged or

user and the POTW sampling of the user indicates a violation, the Director of Treatment Plants shall
repeat the sampling and obtain the results of the repeat analysis within thirty (30) days after becoming
aware of the violations, unless one of the following occurs:
(1) the Director of Treatment Plants monitors at the user's facility at least once a month; or
(2) the Director of Treatment Plants samples the user between their initial sampling and when
the POTW receives the results of this initial sampling; or
(3) the Director of Treatment Plants requires the user to perform sampling and submit the results
to the Director of Treatment Plants within the 30 day deadline of the POTW becoming aware
of the violation.
SECTION 14-96. – SAME; NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
The Town prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes without notification to and approval by the Director of
Treatment Plants.
(a) Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional
Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any
discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth
in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch,
or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar
month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents
contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
wastestream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration
of such constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12)
months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days before the discharge commences.
The user shall not begin the discharge until receiving written approval from the Town. Any notification
under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However,
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under Section 14.92 of this ordinance. The
notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject
to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of this ordinance.
(b) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a), above, during a calendar month in
which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are
acute hazardous wastes as specific in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.
Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous
waste do not require additional notification.
(c) In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of
hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision
363
Director of Treatment Plants, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective
date of such regulations.
(d) In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in
place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
(e) This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be
discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.
SECTION 14-97. – SAME; ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed by a laboratory certified by the state to perform the wastewater analyses in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 146, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard or unless otherwise performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA or Town. If 40
CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses
must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA and Town. Analyses must be performed by a State
certified lab for each parameter analyzed, if such certification exists for that parameter.
SECTION 14-98. – SAME; GRAB AND COMPOSITE SAMPLE COLLECTION.
(a) All wastewater samples must be representative of the user' discharge. Wastewater monitoring and
flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working
order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not
be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(b) Grab Samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, volatile organic
compounds, and any other pollutants as required by 40 CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the
number of grabs necessary to be representative of the User’s discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g) (5) for
additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and 90 Day Compliance Reports. Additionally,
the Director of Treatment Plants may allow collection of multiple grabs during a 24 hour period which
are composited prior to analysis as allowed under 40 CFR 136.
(c) Composite Samples: All wastewater composite samples shall be collected with a minimum of hourly
aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be
collected using flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Director of Treatment Plants. When
authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be representative and the
decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented.
SECTION 14-99. – SAME; TIMING.
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall
govern.
SECTION 14-100. – SAME; RECORD KEEPING.
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this ordinance shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying,
all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this ordinance and any additional
records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such
requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s)
taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3)
Town of Red Springs CODE OF ORDINANCES 2015 Revision
364
years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the Town, or
where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Director of Treatment Plants.
SECTION 14-101. – SAME; ELECTRONIC REPORTING.
The Director of Treatment Plants may develop procedures for receipt of electronic reports for any reporting
requirements of this Ordinance. Such procedures shall comply with 40 CFR Part 3. These procedures shall be
enforceable under Section 8 of this Ordinance.
SECTION 14-102. – COMPLIANCE MONITORING; MONITORING FACILITIES.
The Town requires the user to provide and operate at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should
normally be situated on the user's premises, but the Town may, when such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that
it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of
samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in
accordance with the requirements of the Town and all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the Town.
SECTION 14-103. – SAME; INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
The Town will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this ordinance is being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged
shall allow the Town, approval authority and EPA or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance of any
of their duties. The Town, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices
as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user
has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises,
the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the Town, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the Town, approval authority’s or EPA's access to the
user's premises shall be a violation of this ordinance. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access.
SECTION 14-104. – SAME; SEARCH WARRANTS.
If the Town, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof,
and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this ordinance, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the Town designed to verify
compliance with this ordinance or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety
and welfare of the community, then the Town, approval authority, or EPA ay seek issuance of a search warrant from the
court having jurisdiction within the Town.
