EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

PREAMBLE
   Being grateful to Almighty God for the blessings of liberty, we, the people
of the City of Vandalia, Ohio, in order to secure and exercise all the powers
and benefits of local self-government under the Constitution of the State of
Ohio, do enact and adopt this Charter.
ARTICLE I - POWERS
SECTION 1-1.   POWERS OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT.
   The City of Vandalia shall have authority to exercise all powers of local
self-government and to adopt and enforce within its limits such local police,
sanitary, and other similar regulations, as are not in conflict with general
laws.
   In addition to the powers expressed or implied in this Charter, the City of
Vandalia, through the official acts of its legislative body, shall have and may
exercise all other powers which are possible under the Constitution and laws of
the State of Ohio.
   The listing of particular powers by this Charter shall not be held to
exclude other powers to which the City of Vandalia, under the Constitution and
laws of the State of Ohio, is entitled.
ARTICLE II - FORM OF GOVERNMENT
SECTION 2-1.   COUNCIL - MANAGER GOVERNMENT.
   The municipal government provided by this Charter shall be known as the
Council-Manager Government, and shall consist of a Council of seven citizens,
of which six shall be Councilmembers and one shall be a separately elected
Mayor as provided in Section
3-2. The Council shall constitute the governing body with powers to pass
ordinances, to adopt regulations, and to exercise all powers provided by this
Charter. (Amended 5-7-85)
ARTICLE III - COUNCIL
SECTION 3-1.   QUALIFICATIONS.
Candidates for the office of the Council must be qualified electors of the City
of Vandalia, Ohio.
   Any person elected to the Council must maintain his residence within the
corporate limits of the City of Vandalia, Ohio.
   Members of the Council shall not hold any other public office of the City of
Vandalia, or employment in any agency or department of the City of Vandalia.
SECTION 3-2.   TERM OF OFFICE.
   In the general municipal election in November, 1985, the three candidates
receiving the highest number of votes shall serve for a term beginning January
1, 1986, to December 31, 1989. The successors of the three members elected for
the term ending December 31, 1989, shall be elected in the general election in
November, 1989, and every fourth year thereafter.
   In the general municipal election in November, 1987, three members of
Council and the Mayor shall be elected at-large to take office commencing
January, 1988. The mayoral candidates in the general election shall be
determined by a primary election in May, 1987, and every fourth year
thereafter, with the two receiving the highest number of votes being qualified
to be a candidate for Mayor in the general election.
   The Mayor shall be elected by separate ballot from the municipality at-large
for a term of four years. The successors of the three Councilmembers elected
for the term ending December 31, 1991, shall be elected in the general election
of November, 1991, and every fourth year thereafter. The successor to the Mayor
shall be determined by the qualified candidate receiving the highest number of
votes in the general election of November, 1991, and every fourth year
thereafter.
   Should a vacancy in the Council occur between elections and the time of
taking office, the candidate receiving the highest number of votes not elected
as determined by the Board of Elections shall be appointed by the newly elected
Council. If no surplus candidates are available by election process, Council
shall appoint an elector from the City of Vandalia.
   Any Council seat that becomes vacant during the regular term of office for
any reason, except by succession to position of Mayor, shall be filled by the
majority vote of the remaining members of Council. If Council should fail to
fill such vacancy within thirty days, the same shall be filled by appointment
by the Mayor. Should any Council seat become vacant because a Councilmember
whose term has not expired has been elected Mayor, then such vacancy in Council
shall be filled by the candidate receiving the highest number of votes not
elected as determined by the Board of Elections.
(Amended 11-6-84; 5-7-85)
SECTION 3-3.   SALARIES.

January following its election, and every two years thereafter.
   Council shall take official action and conduct all deliberations upon
official business only in open meetings unless the subject matter is

municipality at large for a four-year term. The Mayor shall be a Councilmember
and have the right to vote on all issues before the Council, but shall have no
power of veto. The Mayor shall, in addition to his or her powers, rights, and
duties as a member of Council, preside at meetings of the Council and shall be
recognized as the official head of the City of Vandalia for all ceremonial
purposes; by the Governor for military purposes; and by the courts for the
purpose of serving civil process. The Mayor shall perform all other duties
prescribed for him or her in the Charter and such other duties as may be
officially imposed upon him or her by any measure of Council and not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Charter. The Mayor shall have all
judicial powers as now or hereafter are provided by the laws of the State of
Ohio. (Amended 5-7-85)
SECTION 3-6.   VICE MAYOR.
   At each organizational meeting, the Council shall elect by a majority vote
one of its members as Vice Mayor. If Council should fail to elect a Vice Mayor

of the Vice Mayor. This action must be taken at the first meeting of the
Council following the succession to the office of the Mayor by the Vice Mayor.

SECTION 3-7.   CLERK OF COUNCIL.
   The Council shall appoint, for an indefinite period, a Clerk whose
responsibilities shall be to keep the journal and other records of the Council
and to perform such other duties as the Council may require consistent with the
provisions of this Charter.
SECTION 3-8.   REMOVAL.
   If a member elected or appointed to the Council is convicted of a felony or
fails to fulfill requirements set forth in this Charter, action for removal
shall be initiated by motion of the City Council and the office immediately
declared vacant by special resolution of Council, with an affirmative vote of
five of its members.
SECTION 3-9.   RECALL.
   The electors shall have the power to remove from office by a recall election
any elected officer of the municipality.
   If any elected officer shall have served for six months of his or her term,
a petition demanding his or her removal may be filed with the Clerk of Council
who shall note thereon the name and address of the person filing the petition
and the date of such filing. Such petition may be circulated in separate parts,
but the separate parts shall be bound together and filed as one instrument.
   Each part shall contain the name and office of the person whose removal is
sought and a statement in not more than two hundred words of the grounds for
removal. Such petition shall be signed by not less than twenty-five percent of
the qualified electors. Within ten days after the day on which such petition is
filed, the Clerk of Council shall determine whether or not it meets the
requirements hereof.
   If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition insufficient, he or she
shall certify the particulars in which the petition is defective, deliver a
copy of his or her certificate to the person who filed the petition with him or
her within five days, and make a record of such delivery. A period of twenty
days after delivery of such certificate shall be allowed to make the petition
sufficient.
   If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition sufficient, he or she shall
so certify to the Council at their next regular meeting, shall deliver a copy
of such certificate to the officer whose removal is sought, and shall make a
record of such delivery. If such officer shall not resign within five days
after the day on which such delivery shall have been made, the Council shall
thereupon order and fix a day for holding a recall election, not less than
sixty nor more than seventy-five days after the date of such delivery, at the
same time as any other general or special election held within such period; but
if no such election be held within such period, the Council shall call a
special recall election to be held within the time aforesaid.
   At such recall election this question shall be placed on the ballot: "Shall
(naming the officer) be allowed to continue as (naming the office)?" with
provision on the ballot for voting affirmatively or negatively on such
question. If the majority of the votes cast at such election shall be voted
affirmatively, such officer shall remain in office and he or she shall not
again be subject to recall for a period of one year for the same issue. If a
majority of the votes cast shall be voted negatively, such officer shall be
considered as removed, his or her office shall be deemed vacant, and such
vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter. The officer removed by
such recall election shall not be eligible for appointment to the vacancy
thereby created.
   Within twenty days after receipt of the certificate demanding recall action,
the accused may in defense submit to the Clerk of Council a letter containing
not more than two hundred words answering to the charges brought forth
requesting recall. This answer shall be printed and mailed at City expense to
each registered voter within the municipality not later than ten days before
the day set for recall election.
   In the event the officer being recalled resigns his or her office prior to
the date set for a special recall election, Council may take action to cancel
such special recall election.

phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by
legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.
(ORC 1.42)

the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may
be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.
         (ORC 1.14)
      (3)   When an act is to take effect or become operative from and after a
day named, no part of that day shall be included.  If priority of legal rights
depends upon the order of events on the same day, such priority shall be
determined by the times in the day at which they respectively occurred.
         (ORC 1.15)
      (4)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from
a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding

with State statute or Charter provisions.
   (f)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law
which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when
the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
(Ord. 76-12. Passed 5-17-76.)
202.04   REVIVOR; EFFECT OF RE-ENACTMENT, AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing provision of the Codified Ordinances does
not revive the provision originally repealed nor impair the effect of any
saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment, or repeal of the Codified Ordinances does
not, except as provided in division (c) of this section:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the provision or any prior action
taken thereunder.
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation, or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded, or incurred thereunder.
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture, or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal.
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding, or remedy in respect of any
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture, or punishment; and the
investigation, proceeding, or remedy may be instituted, continued, or enforced,
and the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment imposed, as if the provision had not
been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment for any offense is reduced
by a re-enactment or amendment of the Codified Ordinances, the penalty,
forfeiture, or punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according
to the Codified Ordinances as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
202.05   CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of a provision of the Codified Ordinances
applies to all re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
section or an inclusive group of sections, or of divisions or subdivisions of a
section, such reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any provision
of the section, sections, divisions or subdivisions included in the reference.
   (d)   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized
under designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case,
action taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is

202.06   CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.  (ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

202.07   DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.

      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended. 
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. 
      (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49; Ord. 76-12.  Passed 5-17-76.)
202.08   SEPARABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
202.99   GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, the commission or performance
of such act, or the failure to commit or perform such act, as required, shall,
unless another penalty is provided, be deemed a minor misdemeanor and the
offender shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each
offense. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues, unless otherwise
provided.

   Council hereby determines pursuant to Charter Section 10-13, that purchasing
of supplies, materials and equipment is a matter of local concern and that the
provisions of Ohio R.C. 715.18 are inoperable within the City. (Ord. 75-28.
Passed 10-6-75.)
208.02   REQUISITIONS AND INFORMAL BIDS.
   (a)   The City Manager or his or her designated agent shall make all
purchases for the City required by the various departments and shall sell used,
worn out, surplus or obsolete equipment and material.
   (b)   Whenever the head of the department deems it necessary or desirable
that supplies, materials, equipment or contractual services be purchased or
secured, such department head shall prepare and submit to the City Manager or
his or her designated agent, a request therefor specifying the nature of the
purchase desired, the quantity required and the performance requirements to be
met.
   (c)   The City Manager or his or her designated agent shall inquire of
potential suppliers as to the cost of such purchase in the form of informal
offers to supply the item required.
(Ord. 75-28. Passed 10-6-75.)
   (d)   If the probable cost thereof will be twenty five thousand dollars
($25,000) or more, the City shall resort to formal bidding as hereinafter
provided. If the probable cost will be more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000)
but less than twenty five thousand dollars ($25,000), the City may award the
purchase to the supplier offering the lowest and best bid among formal bidders.
However, in such case, at least two informal bids or a statement as to why bids
are not available shall be secured in writing and filed with the Director of
Finance. Prior to awarding the bid, City Council shall be advised of the
proposed purchase.
   (e)   The requirement for formal bidding may be waived by affirmative vote
of five Council members upon a finding by Council that:
      (1)   The purchase consists of goods or services, or any combination
thereof, for which only one source of supply is reasonably available;
      (2)   The purchase of goods or services is made from another political
subdivision, public agency, the State, or the Federal government, or as a
third-party beneficiary under a State or Federal procurement contract;
      (3)   The purchase substantially involves services of a personal,
professional, highly technical, or scientific nature, including but not limited
to the services of an attorney, physician, surveyor, appraiser, investigator,
adjuster, advertising consultant, or licensed broker, or involves the special
skills or proprietary knowledge required for the servicing of specialized
equipment owned by the City;
      (4)   The purchase consists of the goods or services of a public utility;
or
      (5)   There would be no benefit to the City to undertake formal bidding
and the best interest of the City is served by waiving the formal bidding.
(Ord. 98-08. Passed 7-6-98; Ord. 07-11.  Passed 7-16-07; Ord. 18-04. Passed 3-

208.03   FORMAL BIDDING.
   (a)   Whenever formal bidding is necessary by reason of the probable amount
involved, the City Manager or his or her designated agent shall prepare or
cause to be prepared specifications for the article or services required and
shall advertise the requirements of the City at least once in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City, inviting suppliers to tender bids in writing
for the furnishing of such requirements. Such bids shall be publicly opened not
less than ten days following the date of the first advertisement, at a time and
place specified in the published notice. The bids shall be opened and tabulated
publicly by the City Manager or his or her designated agent. An investigation
of the responsibility of the bidders shall be made if the City Manager deems it
necessary.
   (b)   The City Manager shall report to Council the bids and results of any
investigations of the responsibility of the bidders and shall recommend to
Council the selection of the lowest and best bid, or, if he determines that the
interest of the City would be better served, the rejection of all bids. (Ord.
75-28. Passed 10-6-75.)
   (c)   No contract for the purchase of articles or services at a cost of
twenty five thousand dollars ($25,000) or more shall be made unless Council has
authorized and directed the City Manager to do so. Contracts for the purchase
of articles or services costing twenty five thousand dollars ($25,000) or more
shall be submitted to the Director of Finance for certification as to the
availability of funds.
   (d)   The City acknowledges a desire to award contracts involving City
concerns and funded by City money, to individuals and businesses that are
located within the City of Vandalia. Where a preliminary analysis of the bids
identifies a bid from a Vandalia individual or business, City Council may give
a preference to the Vandalia bid and award the contract to the Vandalia bidder
when:
      (1)   Such bid is within 5% of the lowest bid price (for a low bid of
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or less) or within 2% of the lowest bid price
(for a low bid price over fifty thousand dollars ($50,000)), and
      (2)   But for the bid price, the Vandalia bid would otherwise be
considered the lowest and best bid by the City in its normal evaluation
procedures in deciding whether or not to award the contract.

the Prevailing Wage Law, are specifically not incorporated into these Codified
Ordinances. Council and the various City officers charged with the
responsibilities of negotiating, preparing and executing contracts on behalf of
the City shall not be bound by any provision of the Prevailing Wage Law, nor
shall the City or any of its officers designate a Prevailing Wage Coordinator
to perform the various responsibilities specified in the Prevailing Wage Law.
Contracts entered into by the City shall not comply with the Prevailing Wage
Law unless Council, in its authorizing legislation, specifically provides to
the contrary, or unless, as a condition of funding, the City is required to so
comply. (Ord. 80-07. Passed 4-21-80.)
208.08   JOINT COOPERATIVE PURCHASING PROGRAMS .

programs for the purchase of materials, supplies and equipment conducted by
other governmental entities or associations whose membership is composed of

is to the City's advantage.

   Zoning of newly annexed property will remain the same, until such time as
the property is rezoned to a similar City zoning classification. Agricultural
property will remain agriculturally zoned and will initially be transferred
into City zoning classifications as such, unless a change in the zoning
classification is requested by the property owner and such change is acceptable
to the City.
(Res. 95-R-06.  Passed 2-20-95.)
210.03   PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS. 
   Street lighting, curbs and sidewalks, street and road improvements, storm
and sanitary sewer improvements, water service and other public works will be
provided to newly annexed areas when a majority of residents living in such
areas petition Council for the extension of such services, and/or the Council
recognizes a legitimate need for such improvements in those areas to guarantee
the public health, safety and welfare.
(Res. 95-R-06.  Passed 2-20-95.)
210.04   FIREARMS; HUNTING AND TRAPPING. 
   The recreational discharge of firearms and hunting and trapping by the owner
or his or her designated representative, on agriculturally zoned property may
occur, provided that a permit for such purpose is issued by the Chief of
Police. The killing of rats and other undesirable rodents may occur when
authorized by the Chief, so long as the means for such killing have been
authorized by the Chief as well.
(Res. 95-R-06.  Passed 2-20-95.)
210.05   ANIMAL HUSBANDRY. 
   The keeping of livestock in newly annexed areas will be permitted only on
agriculturally zoned property.  Such use, which existed lawfully at the time of
annexation, in all other zoning districts, may continue as a nonconforming use
in accordance with the Zoning Code.  The number of livestock kept as a
nonconforming use may not be increased.
(Res. 95-R-06.  Passed 2-20-95.)
210.06   ASSESSMENT POLICY.
   Council recognizes that the annexation of Township areas may result in the
City becoming responsible for the provision of public works, such as streets,
curbs and sidewalks, storm and sanitary sewers and water services, etc., which
may be nonexistent or below minimum City standards and which will require
future replacement or improvement.  The replacement or provision of the above
public improvements will require Council to, at times, assess those property
owners who receive a benefit from such improvements.  Council recognizes the
financial burden which such assessments create on property owners and will
strive to keep such assessments to a minimum. However, the utilization of
assessments to recoup the costs of public improvements benefiting newly annexed
properties is both equitable and necessary due to a majority of all existing
City property owners having personally absorbed similar costs of public
improvements.  In light of the above, Council has established the following
general assessment policy and specific criteria for public improvements in
newly annexed areas:
   (a)   The City Government will initiate no public improvement project unless
the public health, safety or welfare necessitates said improvement and/or a
majority of the residents of an area petition or request Council to make such
improvements.
   (b)   
The City will make every reasonable effort to qualify any contemplated public
improvement project for County, State and Federal assistance. Applications for
intergovernmental assistance for projects will be determined by Council on a
priority basis after review of community needs and project eligibility.
   (c)   That portion of public improvement project costs not covered through
intergovernmental assistance will be distributed as follows:
      (1)   The City will pay all administrative and engineering costs and the
costs of improvements made on public property and all intersections on public
thoroughfares.
      (2)   The remaining public improvement costs will be prorated among the
property owners deriving benefit from said improvement and paid by special
assessment.  The special assessment will be determined either on a front-
footage basis or by district, depending on which method is more appropriate for
said improvement.  The question of whether or not to assess for a public
improvement, the method of assessment and the amount and duration of the
assessment, will be determined by Council after holding public hearings for
affected property owners.
      (3)   In the case of front-footage assessments, if the front property
footage exceeds 200 feet, the assessment shall be applied only to the developed
portion of the frontage, or 200 feet, whichever is greater. The remainder of
the assessment shall be applied and be paid at the time the property is
developed.  The exception to this section is curb and sidewalk improvements on
non-agriculturally zoned property, which shall be fully assessed.
      (4)   In the case of assessment by district, the -assessment shall be
applied based upon the percentage of use or general benefit derived by the
property owner from said improvement.
      (5)   In no case will a property owner's total assessment be greater than
one-third the value of the developed property.
   (d)   Any property owner receiving an assessment will have the option of
paying the entire assessment in a single payment or having the assessment, plus
interest, paid through installments along with property taxes over a period of
time to be determined by Council.
(Res. 95-R-06.  Passed 2-20-95.)
210.07   STREET AND ROAD MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS. 
   Public street maintenance (resurfacing, snow plowing, sweeping and curb,
sidewalk and guard rail maintenance) will be provided at no charge to
residents.  Street improvements (reconstruction, widening, initial curbing or
similar improvements involving substantial capital investment) will normally be
assessed on a front-footage basis.  A typical street improvement project may
include any or all of the following: pavement, curbs and gutters, sidewalks,
local storm drains and guard rails. The maximum assessment upon residential
property shall be based upon a thirty-seven foot street cross-section, as
specified in the City's standard construction drawings.  If streets on both
sides of a corner lot are improved, the shortest side will be taken as the
frontage for assessment purposes.
(Res. 95-R-06.  Passed 2-20-95.)
210.08   CURBS AND SIDEWALKS. 
   The City will pay for the construction of corner radii and the replacement
of existing curbs.  Property owners will be assessed for the initial
construction of curbs and sidewalks and for replacement of existing sidewalks,
based on a front-footage basis. Agriculturally zoned property will receive a
maximum assessment based upon a 200-foot frontage, with the remainder assessed
at the time of development.
(Res. 95-R-06.  Passed 2-20-95.)
210.09   STORM SEWERS.
   Storm sewer improvements will be assessed on a front-footage basis for
specific benefit and/or by special district for general benefit derived by
property owners from major drainage improvements, whichever is most
appropriate.
(Res. 95-R-06.  Passed 2-20-95.)
210.10   SANITARY SEWERS.
   Sanitary sewer improvements will be assessed on a front-footage basis to
properties for specific benefit and/or by district for general benefit for
major sewers servicing the area.  The shortest side of the corner lot will be
taken as the frontage for assessment purposes where utilities run along both
street rights of way. 
(Res. 95-R-06.  Passed 2-20-95.)
210.11   WATER SERVICES.
   Water service improvements will be assessed on a front-footage basis.  The
shortest side of a corner lot will be taken as the frontage for assessment
purposes where water lines run along both street rights of way.  The maximum
assessment to residential property shall be based upon an eight-inch diameter
pipe.
(Res. 95-R-06.  Passed 2-20-95.)
210.12   STREET LIGHTING. 
   There will be no assessments for street lighting, which will be paid for by
the City.  (Res. 95-R-06.  Passed 2-20-95.)
210.13   POLICY DURATION.
   The policy established in this chapter shall cover all pending, proposed and
subsequent petitions for annexation of new territory into the City.
(Res. 95-R-06.  Passed 2-20-95.)

Council. The Clerk shall call the roll and each Council member shall respond
"yes", "no" or "abstain". No other comments shall be considered proper during
the voting. The order of voting by Council members shall rotate with each
successive vote. After the voting is completed, the Mayor shall announce the
result. Except as otherwise provided, these rules are by law the simple
majority and shall carry any motion, ordinance or resolution. The vote of any
member of Council shall not be questioned.
(Ord. 75-12. Passed 5-5-75.)
      (2)   All ballots taken pursuant to a regular vote shall be destroyed
within twenty-four hours of such vote, unless Council, by a majority vote,
votes to retain such ballots for a different period of time.
(Ord. 84-01.  Passed 2-20-84.)
   (b)   Right of Floor. When any member is about to address Council, he or she
shall respectfully address himself or herself to the Mayor and when recognized
by the Chair shall confine himself or herself to the question under debate,
avoid personalities and refrain from imputing the motives of any member's
argument or vote. When two or more members ask recognition at the same time,
the Mayor shall name the member who was first to speak and the exercise of such
discretion by the Mayor shall not be subject to appeal under these rules.
   The Mayor may, upon request of a Councilman, grant a citizen the right of
floor and he or she shall confine himself or herself to the question under
debate, avoid personalities and refrain from imputing the motives of any
member's argument and vote, and he or she shall not be allowed to speak for a
longer time than five minutes.  (Adopting Ordinance)
   (c)   Time Limitation on Speaking. No person shall be allowed to speak for
longer than five minutes at any one time without the permission of Council. No
member shall speak more than once on the same motion until every other member
desiring to speak on that motion has had an opportunity to do so, nor shall the
Mayor or any Councilman speak longer than fifteen minutes upon the same motion,
ordinance or question without the consent of Council. (Ord. 84-01. Passed 2-20-
84.)
   (d)   Members Called to Order. If any member is speaking or otherwise
transgresses the rules of Council, the Mayor shall call the offending member to
order. The member so called to order shall immediately refrain from further
comment unless permitted by the Mayor to explain. Any member may, by raising
the point of order, call the attention of the Mayor to such transgression. The
point of order shall be decided by the Mayor without debate. Each such decision
of the Mayor shall be subject to appeal to Council.
   (e)   Right of Appeal. Any member may appeal to Council from a ruling of the
Mayor. The member making the appeal may briefly state his or her reason for the
same and the Mayor may briefly explain his or her ruling. There shall be no
debate on the appeal and no other member shall participate in the discussion.
The Mayor shall then put the question. "Shall the decision of the Chair be
sustained?" If a majority of the members vote "yes", the ruling of the Chair is
sustained, otherwise, it is overruled.
   (f)   Personal Privilege. Any member may rise to explain the matter personal
to himself or herself and on stating that it is a matter of personal privilege,
he or she shall be recognized by the Mayor but shall not discuss the question
or issue in such explanation. Such explanation shall not consume more than five
minutes of time, unless extended by consent of Council. Matters of personal
privilege shall yield only to a motion to recess or adjourn.
(Ord. 75-12.  Passed 5-5-75.)
220.05   MOTIONS.
   (a)   Purpose and Form. Motions shall be used only to expedite the orderly
transaction of the business of Council and shall not be substituted for
resolutions or ordinances. The form of all motions shall be "I move that"
followed by the substance of the motion. A second shall be required for any
motion except as specifically provided for in a rule, but upon demand of any
member, any motion shall be reduced to writing by the Clerk of Council. Any
such motion may be withdrawn by the maker before it has been amended or voted
upon. When a motion is made, it shall be stated by the Mayor before any debate
shall be in order. All motions which have been entertained by the Mayor shall
be entered upon the minutes.
   (b)   Precedence of Motions. When a question is before Council, no motion
shall be entertained except the following:
      (1)   To adjourn.
      (2)   To fix the hour of adjournment.
      (3)   For the previous question (to request that discussion end and that
any motion being considered be voted on).
      (4)   To lay on the table.
      (5)   To postpone to a certain day.
      (6)   To postpone indefinitely.
      (7)   To refer to a committee.
      (8)   To amend.
   These motions shall have precedence in the order indicated. The motion to
adjourn and the motion to the previous question shall be put to a vote without
debate. The motion to fix the hour of adjournment shall be debatable only as to
the time of such adjournment. All other motions shall be debatable.
   (c)   Motion to Adjourn. (When not in order not debatable). A motion to
adjourn shall be in order at any time without a second except as follows:
      (1)   When repeated without intervening business or discussion.
      (2)   When made as an interruption of a member while speaking.
      (3)   When the previous question has been ordered.
      (4)   While a vote is being taken.
   (d)   The Previous Question. A motion for the previous question shall
require a majority vote of all members present. It shall be considered only
once; may be renewed after intervening business; shall take precedence over all
debatable questions; and shall be in order to prevent amendment of undebatable
questions. When the previous question is moved and seconded by one other
member, it shall be put as follows: "Shall the main question be now put?" There
shall be no further amendment or debate, but pending amendments shall be put in
their order before the main question. If the question "Shall the main question
be now put?" is decided in the negative the main question remains before
Council.
   (e)   Motion to Lay on the Table. The motion to lay on the table shall
dispose finally of all legislation against which it is invoked, but a motion to
lay on a pending amendment to an ordinance or resolution shall not carry the
ordinance or resolution with it. The motion to lay on the table shall require a
majority vote of members present.
   (f)   Motion to Postpone to a Day Certain. The motion to postpone to a day
certain shall require a majority vote of the members present; shall be subject
to reconsideration; may be renewed after intervening business; shall be
debatable as to the propriety of the postponement, but not upon the merits of
the legislation; and may be amended by changing the date. Upon the arrival of
the date to which postponed, the legislation shall be considered in the regular
order of business of that day.
   (g)   Motion to Postpone Indefinitely. The motion to postpone indefinitely
shall have the same effect as the motion to lay on the table and shall require
a majority vote of all members present. The motion to postpone indefinitely
shall not be reconsidered; shall be debatable and shall open the legislation to
debate; may be renewed after intervening business and may not be amended or
laid on the table; and shall be subject to the previous question.
   (h)   Reconsideration. After the decision of any question any member who
voted with the majority may move a reconsideration of any action at the same or
the next succeeding meeting. However, an ordinance or resolution authorizing or
relating to any contract may be reconsidered at any time before the final
execution thereof. A motion to reconsider shall require a majority vote of all
members present. After a motion for reconsideration has once been acted upon,
no other motion for reconsideration thereof shall be made without unanimous
consent of all the members present.
   (i)   Suspension of Rule. Except as controlled by law, any rule may be
suspended by the vote of a majority of all members present without debate.
   (j)   Motion to Amend. A motion to amend shall be susceptible to but one
amendment. An amendment once rejected may not be moved again in the same form.
   (k)   Special Order. To make any subject a special order shall require the
consent of a majority of the members present.
   (l)   Robert's Rules of Order. In the absence of any Council rule upon the
matter of business, Council shall be governed by the ordinary rules governing
legislative bodies as set forth in Robert's Rules of Order. (Ord. 75-12. Passed
5-5-75.)
220.06   RULES AND AMENDMENTS.
   (a)   Amending Rules. These rules may be amended or altered or new rules
adopted by a majority vote of all members elected to Council.
   (b)   Other Rules.  Except as otherwise provided, proceedings of Council
shall be governed by the City Charter and Robert's Rules of Order, and it shall
be the duty of the Mayor to adhere to and enforce such rules together with the
rules herein set forth.
(Ord. 75-12.  Passed 5-5-75.)
220.07   ATTENDANCE POLICY FOR BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS.
   (a)   All persons appointed to a City established board or committee are
expected to attend all meetings of such board or committee, unless absence is
unavoidable and is excused by a majority vote of that board or committee.
   (b)   The secretary of each board or committee shall maintain an accurate
record of the attendance of its members. Such record shall show, for each
meeting, members present, members absent and members whose absence is excused.
Such record, in addition to being noted in the minutes, shall be maintained as
a separate attendance record which shall show a running total of meetings,
attendance at meetings, absence at meetings and excused absence at meetings.
   (c)   Unacceptable attendance by a member shall be defined as an unexcused
absence from three consecutive regular meetings or absence from more than fifty
percent of the regular and special meetings held during any six-month period.
The secretary of each board or committee shall notify the Clerk of Council at
any time when the lack of attendance of a member of the board or committee
reaches the defined unacceptable standard.
   (d)   Upon being notified that an appointee to a board or committee has an
unacceptable attendance record, the Clerk of Council shall forward this
information to Council which shall designate a member to contact the appointee
requesting his or her resignation from that board or committee. Failing to
receive such resignation, the Council shall act to formally remove that person
from that board or committee. The vacancy therein created shall be filled in
accordance with the ordinance requirements for filling of vacancies on boards
or committees. (Res. 84-R-30. Passed 11-5-84. )
220.08   CITIZEN AWARDS.
   (a)   Council is hereby authorized to purchase and present awards to
deserving citizens for their achievements and accomplishments.
   (b)   The Director of Finance is hereby directed to honor any motion,
ordinance or resolution passed by Council pursuant to subsection (a) hereof and
to pay for such awards out of the General Fund of the City.

PROCEDURAL POLICY.
   (a)   The City Manager is hereby authorized to make expenditures for non-

   (b)   For the purpose of making expenditures provided for in subsection (a)
hereof, there is hereby adopted the following Administrative and Procedural
Policy:

(Ord. 75-25.  Passed 8-4-75.)
234.03   INVESTMENT OF IDLE CITY FUNDS.
   (a)    Investment Policy.  It is the policy of the City to invest public
funds in a manner which will ensure the preservation of capital while providing
the highest investment return with the maximum security, meeting the daily cash
flow needs of the City, and conforming to all State and local statutes
governing the investment of public funds.
   (b)    Scope.  This Section
234.03 applies to all financial assets of the City.  These funds are accounted
for in the City's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report and include the
following funds: General Fund; Special Revenue Funds; Capital Project Funds;
Debt Service Funds; Enterprise Funds; Trust and Agency Funds; Inter-
Governmental Service Funds; any new fund created by City Council, unless
specifically exempted.
   (c)   Prudence.
      (1)   The standard of prudence to be applied by the Director of Finance
or Investment Advisor shall be the "prudent person" and/or "prudent investor"
standard which states: "Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, which persons, of prudence, discretion, and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital as well as the probable income to be derived."  The prudent person
standard shall be applied in the context of managing the overall portfolio.
      (2)   All authorized persons, acting in accordance with written
procedures and the investment policy and exercising due diligence, shall be
relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or
market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a
timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
   (d)   Objectives.  The primary objectives and procedures of the City's
investment activities shall be in the following order of importance:
      (1)   Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the
investment program.  Investments of the City shall be undertaken in a manner
that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio.  To
attain this objective, diversification is required in order that potential
losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the
remainder of the portfolio.
      (2)   Liquidity.  The City investment portfolio will remain sufficiently
liquid to enable the City to meet all operating requirements which might be
reasonably anticipated.
      (3)   Return on investment.  The investment portfolio of the City shall
be designed in a manner to attain a measurable market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, with the City's investment risk constraints and
the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio.
      (4)   Maintain the public's trust.  All participants in the investment
process shall seek to act responsibly as custodians of the public trust. The
Director of Finance shall recognize that the investment portfolio is subject to
public review and evaluation.  In addition, the overall investment program
shall be designed and managed with a degree of professionalism worthy of the
public trust.  The Director of Finance or Investment Advisor shall also avoid
any transaction that might knowingly impair public confidence in the City
Council's ability to govern effectively.
   (e)   Delegation of Authority.  Management responsibility for the investment
program is hereby delegated to the Director of Finance, who shall be
responsible for all investment decisions and transactions undertaken.  The
Director of Finance shall develop and maintain written administrative
procedures for the daily operation of the investment program, consistent with
this section.  The Director of Finance may contract with an Investment Advisor,
with the approval of the City Manager.  In the absence of the Director of
Finance, the Finance Supervisor will assume all related investment
responsibilities, subject to review and approval by the City Manager.  No
person may engage in investment transactions except as provided under the terms
of this Section
234.03 and the administrative procedures established by the Director of
Finance.
   (f)   Ethics and Conflict of Interest.  City employees and any contracted
Investment Advisor involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the
investment program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial
investment decisions.  Employees and any contracted Investment Advisor shall
disclose to the City Council any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with the City, and they shall disclose any
large personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the
performance of the City's portfolio.  Employees and any contracted Investment
Advisor shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of
the City particularly with regard to the timing of purchases and sales.
   (g)   Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions.
      (1)   Financial institution is defined as a State or nationally chartered
bank or a State or Federally chartered savings and loan association, or savings
bank whose deposits are insured by an agency of the United States government
and which maintains a principal office or branch office in the State of Ohio
under the laws of Ohio and the United States.
      (2)   Should the City choose not to utilize an investment advisor, then
the Director of Finance shall maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services. Each institution shall provide, at
minimum, their quarterly and annual audited financial statements.  In addition,
a list shall also be maintained of approved security broker/dealers, selected
by credit worthiness (e.g. a minimum capital requirement of ten million dollars
($10,000,000) and at least five years of operation), who are authorized to
provide investment services in the State of Ohio.
      (3)   The security dealers and financial institutions may include primary
or regional dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule
15C3-1 (uniform net capital rule) and investment departments of banks, and
which have been subject to the following evaluation:
         A.   Financial condition, loan exposure, capital adequacy, asset
quality, earnings, and liquidity;
         B.   Regulatory status of the dealer;
         C.   Background and expertise of the individual representative.
      (4)   Individuals representing institutions doing business with the City
shall receive a copy of this Section 234.03, and shall certify that they have
read, comprehended and will abide by its content when recommending, buying or
selling any investment security for the City.  A copy of such certification,
along with respective financial statements, shall be kept on file by the
Director of Finance.
   (h)   Authorized and Suitable Investments.  In accordance with the
provisions included in Ohio R.C. 135.14 and other applicable sections of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 135, as amended, the City is authorized to invest in the following
permissible investments:
      (1)   United States Treasury bills, notes, bonds or any other obligation
or security issued by the United States Treasury or any other obligation
guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States.  Stripped
principal or interest obligations of such eligible obligations are strictly
prohibited.
      (2)   Bonds, notes, debentures, or any other obligations or securities
issued by any Federal government agency or instrumentality, including but not
limited to, the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), Federal Farm Credit Bank (FFCB),
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (FHLMC), and Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA).  All
Federal agency or instrumentality securities must be direct issuances of the
Federal agency or instrumentality.
      (3)    State Treasury Asset Reserve (STAR Ohio), managed by the office of
the Treasurer of the State of Ohio, is an eligible investment as long as the
fund maintains the highest letter rating provided by at least one nationally
recognized standard rating service as outlined in Ohio R.C. 135.45.
      (4)   Certificates of deposit, savings accounts, deposit accounts, or
depository receipts of a financial institution, but only if the financial
institution is eligible to be a depository of funds as provided in Ohio R.C.
135.08.
      (5)   Commercial paper notes issued by an entity that is defined in Ohio
R.C. 1705.01(D) and that has assets exceeding five hundred million dollars
($500.000.000).  At the time of the purchase, the notes must be rated in the
highest classification established by not less than two standard rating
services and that matures not more than 270 days after the date of purchase.
      (6)   Bankers' Acceptances and Deposits of the top 50 banks in the United
States based upon asset size or Ohio-based financial institutions with at least
two billion dollars ($2,000,000,000) in total assets, provided the bank is FDIC
insured. The maturity of bankers’ acceptances is limited to not more than 180
days after the date of purchase.
      (7)   Obligations of this State or any of its political subdivisions that
at the time of purchase are rated as investment grade by not less than one
standard rating service. With respect to obligations of political subdivisions,
the obligations are payable from general revenues of the political subdivision,
backed by the full faith and credit of the political subdivision and the City
is not the sole purchaser of the obligations at original issuance.
      (8)   Investments in no-load money market mutual funds consisting
exclusively of obligations described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section
and repurchase agreements secured by such obligations.
      (9)   Investments in certificates of deposits with FDIC insurance
coverage on the full amount of the deposit through the Certificate of Deposit
Account Registry Service (CDARS), offered by Promontory Interfinancial
Network.  Eligibility for this investment is outlined in Ohio R.C. 135.144 and
would also apply to any other program that is deemed to meet the requirements
of such statute.
      (10)   Repurchase agreements (e.g. sweep accounts) with eligible
institutions.
      (11)   STAR Plus Federally Insured Cash Account.
   (i)   Repurchase Agreements.  Repurchase agreements are permitted only with
any eligible public depository mentioned in Ohio R.C. 135.03, or with any
dealer who is a member of the financial industry regulatory (FINRA) and must be
in writing.  All repurchase agreements must be entered into subject to a Master
Repurchase Agreement providing for the terms outlined below.
      (1)   The market value of the securities subject held as collateral for
an overnight repurchase agreement (including sweep accounts) or term repurchase
agreements must exceed the principal by at least 2%, the securities must be
marked to market daily and the stated margin will be maintained by the initial
seller during the life of the transaction.  No one repurchase agreement may
exceed two million dollars ($2,000,000).  The City retains the right to
terminate the agreement and sell the securities outside the repurchase
agreement. Reverse repurchase agreements are strictly prohibited.
      (2)   Term repurchase agreements may not exceed 30 days. Any repurchase
agreement with an eligible securities dealer must be transacted on a delivery
versus payment basis.  For all securities purchased pursuant to a repurchase
agreement with an institution or dealer, the institution or dealer must agree
in writing to unconditionally repurchase any of the securities used for any
repurchase agreement transaction.
   (j)   Derivatives.  Investments in derivatives are strictly prohibited.  A
derivative is defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 135 as a financial instrument or
contract or obligation whose value is based upon or linked to another asset or
index or both, separate from the financial instrument, contract or obligation
itself.  However, any eligible investment with a variable interest rate payment
based upon a single interest payment or single index comprised of other
investments consisting of U.S. government or Federal agency or instrumentality
obligations is not considered a derivative if it matures in two years or less.
   (k)   Pooling.  The pooling of funds by subdivisions is prohibited except as
provided in Ohio R.C. 715.02 or Section IV, Article XVIII of the Ohio
Constitution, and STAR Ohio.
   (l)   Collateralization.
      (1)   All uninsured deposits shall be collateralized pursuant to the
requirements of the Ohio Revised Code.  Eligible securities used for
collateralizing deposits will be held by the depository and/or a third party
bank or trust company, subject to security and custodial agreements.  In order
to anticipate market changes and provide a level of security for all funds, the
collateralization level shall be at least 105% of market value of principal and
accrued interest when specific collateral is provided or 102% of market value
of principal and accrued interest when pooled collateral is provided.
      (2)   The security agreement shall provide that eligible securities are
being pledged to secure City deposits together with agreed upon interest, if
any, and any costs or expenses arising out of the collection of such deposits
upon default.  It shall also provide the conditions under which the securities
may be sold, presented for payment, substituted, or released providing
collateral values are maintained, and, the events which will enable the City to
exercise its rights against the pledged securities including failure to meet
deposit repayment or collateral terms, or the deposit institution's
insolvency.  In the event that the securities are not registered or inscribed
in the name of the City, such securities shall be delivered in a form suitable
for transfer or with an assignment in blank to the City or its custodial bank.
      (3)   The custodial agreement shall provide the securities held by the
bank or trust company, as agent of and custodian for the City, will be kept
separate and apart from the general assets of the custodial bank or trust
company and shall not, in any circumstances, be commingled with or become part
of the backing for any other deposit or other liabilities.  The agreement shall
also describe how the custodian will confirm the receipt, substitution, or
release of the securities.  The agreement shall provide for daily revaluation
of eligible securities and for the substitution of securities when a change in
the rating of a security may cause ineligibility.  The agreement shall provide
that the custodian will exercise the City's rights to the security or as
instructed by the City.  Such agreement shall include all provisions necessary
to provide the City with a perfected interest in the securities.
   (m)   Safekeeping and Custody.  All security transactions, including
collateral for repurchase agreements entered into by the City shall be
conducted on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) basis.  Securities shall be held
by a third-party custodial bank chartered by the United States government or
the State of Ohio designated by the Director of Finance and evidenced by
safekeeping receipts  with a written custodial agreement.  No withdrawal of
such securities, in whole or in part, shall be made from safekeeping except by
the Director of Finance as authorized herein, or another person authorized in
this Section
234.03 . Any investment advisor, consultant or broker/dealer doing business
with the City cannot serve as custodian or safekeeping agent.
   (n)   Diversification.  The City shall diversify its investments by security
type, institution, and maturity.  With the exception of U.S. Treasury
securities and authorized pools, no more than 75% of the City's total
investment portfolio will be invested in a single security type, (as listed in
division (h) above).  No more than 50% of the City's portfolio will be invested
with a single financial institution.  No more than 40% of the City’s portfolio
will be invested in either commercial paper or bankers acceptances. No more
than 5% of the City’s portfolio will be invested in a single issuer of
commercial paper. Investments in obligations of political subdivisions of the
state are limited to 20% of the City’s portfolio. Diversification strategies
consistent with the above provisions shall be determined and revised by the
Director of Finance from time to time to meet diversification objectives in
order to reduce the overall portfolio risks while attaining measurable market
average rates of return.
   (o)   Maturity Guidelines.
      (1)   Investment maturities for operating funds shall be scheduled to
coincide with projected cash flow needs, taking into account routine needs
(payroll, bi-weekly bill payments, debt service) as well as considering
anticipated revenue (income taxes, utility collections, local government fund
distributions).  To the extent possible, the Director of Finance will attempt
to match the investments with the anticipated cash flow requirements to take
best advantage of prevailing economic and market conditions.  The maximum
maturity of any eligible investment is five years from the settlement date,
unless per a related bond indenture the investment is matched to a specified
obligation or debt of the subdivision.
      (2)   Any investment made should be purchased with the expectation it
will be held to maturity.  Investments may be sold to meet unexpected liquidity
needs, to capture a capital gain, to reinvest in a preferred investment, or if
otherwise determined to be in the best interests of the City.
      (3)   Because of the inherent difficulties in accurately forecasting cash
flow requirements, a portion of the portfolio should be continuously invested
in readily available funds such as, but not limited to, STAR Ohio, money market
funds, or overnight repurchase agreements to ensure that appropriate liquidity
is maintained to meet ongoing obligations.  At least 20% of the portfolio will
be invested in liquid instruments or marketable securities that can be sold to
raise cash with one or two business day's notice.
   (p)   Internal Controls.  The Director of Finance shall establish an annual
process of independent review by the City's designated audit firm, which will
assure compliance with policies and procedures. A system of internal controls
periodically reviewed by the City Manager will be designed to protect the City
from theft, loss, fraud, misrepresentation, imprudent actions and other misuses
of public funds.  Investment transactions shall be separate from the accounting
and recording of those transactions.
   (q)   Performance Standards.  The investment portfolio will be designed to
obtain an average measurable market rate of return during budgetary and
economic cycles, taking into account the City's investment risk constraints and
cash flow needs.  The City's investment strategy is passive. Given this
strategy, the basis used by the Director of Finance to determine whether market
yields are achieved can be BofA Merrill Lynch 1-3 Government/Corporate Index,
T-Bill rates, nationally published CD rates, and nationally reported commercial
paper rates.  The last three indexes can be found in the Wall Street Journal. 
All national index rates must be for similar duration as the City's
investments.  The Director of Finance will continually attempt to utilize
comparable benchmarks for any comparisons to yields earned on the City's
individual investments and portfolio as a whole.
   (r)   Reporting.
      (1)   The Director of Finance shall prepare a monthly investment report
for the City Manager.  The report shall provide an update on the status of the
current investment portfolio.  It shall include, but not be limited to the
following elements: List of investments and percent that each type represents
in the portfolio; Issuer; Purchase Date; Maturity Date (including Call Date, if
applicable); Average life and effective maturity of all investments; Coupon,
discount, or earnings rate; Par value, amortized book value and market value;
Monthly interest earnings; Monthly purchases and redemptions.
      (2)   The Director of Finance shall also prepare a quarterly investment
summary report for distribution to all members of the City Council.  The
composition of the City's investment portfolio and related earnings including
annual gains or losses on the market value of the investment portfolio are
reported in the City's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.  The Director of
Finance shall inform the City Manager of economic changes and budgetary
constraints that have a significant effect on the investment portfolio
earnings.  A review of current and future investment strategies shall also be
discussed on a regular basis.
   (s)    Annual Review.  This Section
234.03  shall be reviewed periodically by the Director of Finance and any
necessary modifications shall be presented for approval by the City Council.

234.06   EXEMPTION OF CITY FROM STATE RETAINAGE ESCROW PROVISIONS RE PUBLIC
IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Council hereby declares that the retainage escrow provisions of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 153 shall not be applicable to the City.
   (b)   Retained funds pursuant to any contract with the City shall be
maintained in accordance with regulations to be established by the Finance
Director, and he or she is hereby authorized to prepare said regulations not
inconsistent with good business practices concerning retainage on contracts.
   (c)   Contractors are to be advised that the preparation of proposals
previously in compliance with Ohio R.C. Chapter 153 is not a proper cost
element to be injected into any contracts with the City.
(Ord. 93-06.  Passed 4-19-93.)

provided on a fraudulent application;
   (l)   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly

account, the City receives a request for new, additional, or replacement goods
or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the account;
   (s)   A new account is used in a manner commonly associated with known
patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer fails to make the first
payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments;
   (t)   A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example
nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;

Program Coordinator, who will then complete additional authentication to
determine the appropriate response.
(Res. 08-R-24.  Passed 10-20-08.)
256.06   APPROPRIATE RESPONSES FOR SUSPECTED FRAUD.
   An appropriate response for suspected fraudulent activity may include:

permit access to a covered account;
   (d)   Reopening a covered account with a new account number;

customers or to the safety and soundness of the organization from identity
theft based on factors such as: the experiences of the organization with
identity theft; changes in methods of identity theft; changes in methods to
detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft; changes in the types of accounts
that the organization offers or maintains; changes in the business arrangements
of the organization, including mergers, acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures
and service provider arrangements.

256.10   OVERSIGHT OF PROGRAM.
   The Program Coordinator shall oversee and take steps to ensure that this

addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered
accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; significant incidents
involving identity theft and the City's response; and recommendations for
material changes to the Program. The Program Coordinator shall train staff, as
necessary, to effectively implement the Program. The Program Coordinator shall
also oversee any service provider arrangements in the event the City engages a
service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more covered
accounts to assure that the activity of the service provider is conducted in
accordance with this Program and any reasonable policies and procedures
designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft.

414.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.  Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence
districts, the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. 
Where two or more through highways designated under this division intersect and
no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians

the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is

beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the

intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway

device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

“don’t walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of

withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician- intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.  If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense.  The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information

of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions.  As used in this section:
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device” means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section.  The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness.  Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person
if convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)
(c), (d), or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C.  4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. 
The person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request
of the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest.  Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.,
O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under
State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest
for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face
increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person’s initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.

driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person.  Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial Appearance.  If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of
a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

transferred and Ohio R.C. 4503.234(B)(2) or (B)(3) applies, in addition to or
independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the

(c)(3)C. of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court, neither the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept any
application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver's
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.

violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
R.C. § 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense
is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued

forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.

was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)

valid permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to 500 hours. The
failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the
court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A)
that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section

of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially

the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s
driver license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).

within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on

§ 4511.01 or a vehicle that is regulated under R.C. § 5104.015, that is
required by the United States Department of Transportation to be equipped with
seat belts at the time of manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor
vehicle shall have the child properly secured in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions on a booster seat that meets federal motor vehicle
safety standards.
   (d)   When any child who is at least eight years of age but not older than
15 years of age, and who is not otherwise required by division (a), (b), or (c)
of this section to be secured in a child restraint system or booster seat, is
being transported in a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety
vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.01, that is required by the United States
Department of Transportation to be equipped with seat belts at the time of
manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor vehicle shall have the child
properly restrained either in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(c) or (d) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law
enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual inspection of a motor
vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not be used for the purpose
of determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed.
   (f)   The Director of Public Safety shall adopt such rules as are necessary
to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat or in an occupant restraining device as
required in this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the
motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
   (h)   This section does not apply when an emergency exists that threatens
the life of any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle that is being
used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section. This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
state under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in
this state under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who
otherwise would be required to be restrained under this section has a physical
impairment that makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat or an
occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   (1)   Whoever violates division (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section
shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a
motor vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system,
booster seat or occupant restraining device as required by this section that
occurred at the same time, on the same day and at the same location is deemed
to be a single violation of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (j)(1)B. of this
section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than $25 nor more than $75.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of division (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section or of a
State law or municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent any of those
divisions, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
      (2)   All fines imposed pursuant to division (j)(1) of this section shall
be forwarded to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Child Highway Safety
Fund created by Ohio R.C. 4511.81(I).

violation of division (b) of this section has been or is being committed or for
the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or summons for the violation or

the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject

      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

of improper replacement of a motor vehicle air bag, a misdemeanor of the first
degree on a first offense. On each subsequent offense, or if the violation
results in serious physical harm to an individual, the person is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (c) of this section is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.

   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
Ohio R.C. 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons” or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit.  Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.

   (a)   The County Sheriff or Chief of Police, within the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper, upon
notification to the Sheriff or Chief of Police of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or
state highway patrol trooper as a result of the performance of the Sheriff’s,
Chief’s, or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the

or Chief of Police of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
However, when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may
be ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;

of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the identity of the
owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the Sheriff
or Chief of Police, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business
days of the removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Sheriff
or Chief of Police shall send or cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at
the owner’s or lienholder’s last known address by certified mail with return
receipt requested, notice that informs the owner or lienholder that the motor
vehicle will be declared a nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten
days of the date of mailing of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the

owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or
storage facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69
(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Sheriff, Chief of Police, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to
be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger

      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles has been conducted and
after notice has been sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this
section, and the search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice
was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or
lienholder shall pay to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of mailing of the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police,
without charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county
in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with
the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the
Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Sheriff or Chief of Police. If the
vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other
facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police shall execute in triplicate
an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and that all
requirements of this section have been complied with. The Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or
other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor
vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)

      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
Municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
such abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the Municipality
from such disposal.

adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor
vehicle. However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the
municipal corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service
shall give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the

required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015,
and apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to July
16, 2015, if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section
as it existed on July 15, 2015.
(ORC 2901.13)
606.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in Ohio R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.”  Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.”  Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.”  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.”  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
606.09   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.10   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.11   ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted.  In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4501.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
606.12   COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
606.13   SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, “residence” and “vehicle” have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 2901.05.
   (b)   For purposes of any section of this Code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person who lawfully is in that person's residence has no duty to
retreat before using force in self defense, defense of another, or defense of
that person's residence, and a person who lawfully is an occupant of that
person's vehicle or who lawfully is an occupant in a vehicle owned by an
immediate family member of the person has no duty to retreat before using force
in self defense or defense of another.

person, knowing that a felony has been or is being committed, shall knowingly
fail to report the information to law enforcement authorities.
      (2)   No person, knowing that a violation of R.C. § 2913.04(B) has been
or is being committed or that the person has received information derived from

persons that the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe resulted from
an offense of violence.

the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the

report required by division (c) of this section was made, or to any law
enforcement officer who has reasonable cause to assert the authority to
investigate the circumstances surrounding the death, any facts within his or
her knowledge that may have a bearing on the investigation of the death.
   (e)   (1)   As used in this section, “burn injury” means any of the
following:

who, outside a hospital, sanitarium, or other medical facility, attends or
treats a person who has sustained a burn injury inflicted by an explosion or
other incendiary device, or that shows evidence of having been inflicted in a

      (5)   Anyone participating in the making of reports under division (e) of
this section or anyone participating in a judicial proceeding resulting from
the reports is immune from any civil or criminal liability that otherwise might
be incurred or imposed as a result of such actions. Notwithstanding Ohio R.C.
4731.22, the physician-patient relationship or advanced practice registered
nurse-patient relationship is not a ground for excluding evidence regarding a
person’s burn injury or the cause of the burn injury in any judicial proceeding

jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog

determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, Ohio R.C. 955.11
(D) and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and
the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog,
and Section
618.18 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.

chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,

accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

632.065   DISCRIMINATION AGAINST HANDICAPPED; GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
   There is hereby adopted an internal grievance procedure providing for the
prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by
the Office of Revenue Sharing’s regulations (31 C.F.R. 51.55(d)(2))
implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29
U.S.C. 794). Section 504 states, in part, that “no otherwise qualified
handicapped individual…shall, solely by reason of his or her handicap, be
excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected
to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial
assistance…”  Complaints should be addressed to the City Manager. Such
grievance procedure is as follows:
   (a)   A complaint should be filed in writing or verbally, shall contain the
name and address of the person filing it and shall briefly describe the alleged
violation of the regulations.
   (b)   A complaint should be filed within ten days after the complainant
becomes aware of the alleged violation. Processing of allegations of
discrimination occurring before this grievance procedure was in place will be
considered on a case-by-case basis.
   (c)   An investigation, as may be appropriate, shall follow a filing of a
complaint. The investigation will be conducted by the City Manager. These rules
contemplate informal but thorough investigations, affording all interested
persons and their representatives, if any, an opportunity to submit evidence
relevant to a complaint. Under 31 C.F.R. 51.55(d)(2), the City need not process
complaints from applicants for employment or from applicants for admission to
post-secondary educational institutions.
   (d)   A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and a
description of its resolution, if any, shall be issued by the City Manager, and
a copy shall be forwarded to the complainant not later than thirty days after
its filing.
   (e)   The Section 504 coordinator shall maintain the files and records of
the City relating to the complaints filed.
   (f)   The complainant may request a reconsideration of the case in instances
where he or she is dissatisfied with the resolution. The request for
reconsideration should be made within ten days to the City Manager who shall
forward such appeal to Council for its further consideration. The decision of
Council shall be final.
   (g)   The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the
complaint filed under this section shall not be impaired by the person’s
pursuit of other remedies, such as the filing of a Section 504 complaint with
the Office of Revenue Sharing, U.S. Department of the Treasury. Utilization of
this grievance procedure is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of other
remedies.

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality.
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially similar municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, 
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried

of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same

value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series.  Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, “fair
market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or

698.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Dangerous offender” means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   “Repeat offender” means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in

more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;

(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
666.99 or
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) or (b)
(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant
to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C.  307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated
the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C.  2903.13 or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.

(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim's economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. The court may base the
amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the
offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating
the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other information, provided
that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
or survivor disputes the amount of restitution. If the court holds an
evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from
the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund

division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division  (d),
(e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to
the Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
seventy dollars ($70.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), which
shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be credited to the address
confidentiality program fund created by Ohio R.C. 111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. 
A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction  of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may bring an action to do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract
            for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to any
financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall comply
with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.

698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section 698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections 666.99 or 698.02 of this
Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a sentence upon an
offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any sanction or
combination of sanctions under Section 698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not
impose a sentence that imposes an unnecessary burden on local government
resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04   ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand

thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05   MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or  sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States.  Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131.  When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a
prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

812.01   PURPOSE; INTENT; FINDINGS.
   (a)    Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate adult
entertainment facilities in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and
general welfare of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of
adult entertainment facilities within the City.  The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on
the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials.  Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market.  Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material. Rather, this chapter is intended to provide for the proper
location of adult uses in order to protect the integrity of adjacent
neighborhoods, educational uses, religious uses, parks and other areas where
large numbers of minors regularly travel or congregate, and the quality of
urban life.  It is the intent of this chapter to limit the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses.  The standards in this chapter are intended to ensure
that residential districts, religious uses, educational uses, parks and other
areas where large numbers of minors regularly travel or congregate are located
in areas free from the adverse secondary effects of adult uses. The location of
residential districts, religious uses, educational uses, parks and other areas
where large numbers of minors regularly travel or congregate within viable,
unblighted and desirable areas supports the preservation of property values and
promotes the health, safety and welfare of the public.
   (b)    Findings.  Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on a community in reports and studies made available to the
Council including, but not limited to, St. Paul, Minnesota; Phoenix, Arizona;
Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas;  Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove,
California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; 
Seattle, Washington; and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and on findings incorporated
in cases decided by the United States Supreme Court, other Federal courts and
Ohio courts, City Council finds: that the enactment of this chapter to regulate
the adult uses is a substantial government interest for the City in preserving
the quality of urban life and that it is in the interest of the health, safety,
morals, and general welfare of the citizens of Vandalia that adult uses are
regulated pursuant to the standards herein. Council further finds:
      (1)    Adult entertainment facilities lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are often uncontrolled by the operators
of the establishments.  Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the
owners of these establishments responsible for such activities that occur on
their premises.
      (2)    Certain employees of certain adult entertainment facilities engage
in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees
of other establishments.
      (3)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of adult entertainment facilities.  Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the adult
entertainment facility is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety
and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. 
It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the permittee is the
actual operator of the adult entertainment facility, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (4)   Requiring permittees of adult entertainment facility to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
(Ord. 08-13.  Passed 6-16-08.)

times that any patron is present on the permitted premises.

any other entertainer, employee or customer on the premises during any

sufficient illumination of the parking areas and walkways serving the adult
entertainment facility for the personal safety of patrons and employees and to
reduce the incidence of vandalism and criminal conduct. The lighting shall be
shown on the sketch or diagram of the premise required as part of the permit
application process.

(Ord. 08-13.  Passed 6-16-08.)
812.24   SEVERABILITY.
   This chapter and each section and provision of this chapter, are hereby
declared to be independent sections and subsections and, notwithstanding any
other evidence of legislative intent, the Council of the City of Vandalia, by
adoption of the legislation containing this section, hereby states that it is
the controlling legislative intent that if any provisions of said chapter, or
the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid,
the remaining sections or provisions and the application of such sections and
provisions to any person or circumstances other than those to which it is held
invalid, shall not be affected thereby, and it is hereby declared that such
sections and provisions would have been passed independently if such section or
provision were so known to be invalid. The adoption of this chapter in a single
legislative act is merely for convenience. This Council intends that each and
every separate part hereof be severable so as to leave in effect as much of
this chapter as is not found invalid so as to provide as much benefit to its
citizens as possible while still protecting the rights guaranteed under the
First Amendment of the Constitution. The City further states that the dispersal
requirement, the location requirement, and the permitting process, for each
type of adult entertainment facility, licensing process for employees and
independent contractors, regulation of permit transfers, regulation of
exhibition of sexually explicit films, digital images, or videos in video
booths, standards of conduct and operation applicable to adult cabarets,
regulations regarding minors, advertising and lighting regulations, regulation
of hours of operation and prohibition of nudity at adult entertainment facility
are each intended  as separate and severable regulations of the City which
would, and could, have been adopted as separate legislative acts.
(Ord. 08-13.  Passed 6-16-08.)
812.25   NOTICE.
   Any notices required pursuant to this chapter not otherwise specified herein
shall be sufficient if served by certified mail, return receipt requested, or
by personal delivery to the permit or license applicants and permittee or
licensee affected at the business or residential address listed on the
applicable application and addressed to the business or applicant. If the
permit is issued to an entity, service of notice as provided above to the
service agent listed on the application shall be sufficient.
(Ord. 08-13.  Passed 6-16-08.)
812.26   APPEAL.
   (a)   Prompt Judicial Review.  The City is aware of the Constitutional
requirement to provide prompt judicial review to persons affected by this
chapter. Since the City cannot legally mandate the timing of judicial review in
these matters, the City has created a right to a temporary permit/license to
maintain the status quo for a permittee/licensee while the permittee/licensee
seeks quasi-judicial and judicial review of a suspension, revocation or denial
of a renewal, in order to prevent the suppression of speech or expression
protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution.
   (b)   If the Chief of Police issues a denial, suspension, or revocation of a
permit or license, or an application for either under this chapter, the Chief
of Police shall notify the applicant or permittee/licensee (respondent) in
writing of the denial, suspension or revocation, including the grounds
therefor, within three business days of such decision. The notification shall
be directed as provided in Section
812.25. The notification shall include information regarding the right to file
an appeal as described below.
   (c)   Within ten days of service of such notice, the respondent may provide
to the City Manager in writing a response requesting an appeal hearing which
shall include an address at which notice may be sent by overnight mail, an e-
mail address for electronic notice, or a telefax phone number for notice of a
hearing date, and a statement of reasons why the permit, license or application
should not be denied, suspended or revoked. A response requesting an appeal
hearing shall be deemed to have been received when delivered to Vandalia City
Hall during regular business hours. If no response requesting an appeal hearing
is received by the City within said ten days, the action shall become final. If
a written response requesting an appeal hearing is received by the City Manager
within said ten days, the City Manager shall notify the respondent within three
business days of the receipt of such written response requesting an appeal
hearing, of a hearing date before the Vandalia Board of Zoning Appeals. Notice
of the hearing date shall be sent by overnight mail at the address provided, by
e-mail at the e-mail address provided, or by telefax to the phone number
provided.
   (d)   The Vandalia Board of Zoning Appeals shall conduct a hearing, and at
which respondent shall have the opportunity to present evidence and witnesses
on his or her behalf. The respondent may appear and be heard in person, or by
his or her attorney, in opposition to the decision and do any of the following:
(i) present his  or her  positions, arguments and contentions; (ii) offer and
examine witnesses and present evidence in support; (iii) cross-examine
witnesses purporting to refute respondent's position, arguments and
contentions; (iv) offer evidence to refute evidence and testimony offered in
opposition to his or her position, arguments and contentions; and (v) proffer
any such evidence into the record, if the admission is denied by the Vandalia
Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (e)   Testimony shall be given under oath. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
have the power to subpoena witnesses or evidence and shall make such power
available to the respondent. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have a complete
record of the adjudication kept, including any evidence admitted or proffered.
If, after the hearing, the Board of Zoning Appeals finds, by majority vote of
the members present at the hearing, that grounds as specified in this chapter
exist for denial, suspension or revocation, then such action shall become final
and notice of such final action shall be sent to the applicant, licensee or
permittee, by written decision. If the Board of Zoning Appeals finds, by
majority vote of the members present at the hearing, that no grounds exist for
denial, suspension or revocation of a permit/license, then the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall overturn the denial, suspension or revocation of the permit/
license or application. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall notify the respondent
and City Manager in writing by delivery, overnight mail, e-mail, telefax or by
certified mail of such action. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall send it
decision within five business days after the hearing.
   (f)   The notice of final decision shall contain: (i) the case number or
other identifier, the applicant, permittee or licensee's name and a brief
description of the matter; (ii) a designation as a final decision; (iii) a
clear pronouncement of the decision including conclusions of fact supporting
the final order; (iv) the signatures of the members of the Board of Zoning
Appeals; and (v) the date the decision was mailed, faxed or delivered.
   (g)    The hearing pursuant to this section shall be held within 21 days of
receipt by the City of the response requesting an appeal hearing. The
respondent may, however, for good cause, request a rescheduling or continuance
of the hearing date, in which case the hearing date shall be extended for a
reasonable period, and the 21-day time period for the hearing shall be extended
by the number of days the hearing is postponed due to the respondent's request.
   (h)   A suspension, revocation of a permit or license, or the denial of a
renewal of a permit or license shall not be final and in effect if a response
requesting an appeal hearing is filed until the later of: (i) the Board of
Zoning Appeals' decision on the appeal becoming final and expiration of any
time period for initial appeal to court from a decision of the Board of Zoning
Appeals; or (ii) if an appeal is taken to court, the entering of a judgment on
the appeal by a court of competent jurisdiction. The existing permit/license
shall be deemed to be a temporary permit or license and shall remain in effect
during such period. Operations under such temporary permit/license shall be
subject to all provisions of this chapter.
   (i)   The City shall be deemed to be adversely affected and aggrieved by a
Board of Zoning Appeals decision which modifies or reverses a permit or license
decision of the Chief of Police, and the City shall have the right to appeal
such a decision to the court.
   (j)   Nothing contained in this section shall permit an applicant to operate
an adult entertainment facility pending an appeal of a denial of an initial
application.
(Ord. 08-13.  Passed 6-16-08.)
812.99   VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Any person who willfully falsifies any material fact on any
application required by this chapter is guilty of a first degree misdemeanor.
   (b)   Any person who fails or refuses to obey or comply with or violates any
provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.
Each violation or noncompliance shall be considered a separate and distinct
offense. Further, each day of continued violation or noncompliance shall be
considered a separate offense.
   (c)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent or restrict the City from
taking such other lawful action in any court of competent jurisdiction as is
necessary to prevent or remedy any violation or noncompliance. Such other
lawful actions shall include, but shall not be limited to, an equitable action
for injunctive relief or an action at law for damages. A person who operates or
causes to be operated an adult entertainment facility without having a valid
permit is subject to a suit for injunction and shall also be guilty of a first
degree misdemeanor. If any injunctive relief must be sought, reasonable
attorneys' fees and related costs and expenses shall be assessed at the
discretion of the Court against the adult entertainment facility, its owners
and operators.
   (d)   All remedies and penalties provided for in this section shall be
cumulative and independently available to the City, and the City shall be
authorized to pursue any and all remedies set forth in this section to the full
extent allowed by law.
   (e)    All violations of this chapter shall be deemed misdemeanors of the
first degree.
   (f)   It is a defense to prosecution for any violation of Section
812.17(a) that the physical contact was inadvertent or accidental in nature.

the City of Vandalia, shall be determined by the books and records of the
taxpayer, if such books and records of the taxpayer shall disclose with
reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is attributable to that part
of the business or profession conducted within the boundaries of Vandalia. In
the absence of such records, the said portion shall be determined as follows:
      (1)   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage

substituted so as to produce such a result.

City of Vandalia" means:

may require such additional information as he or she may deem necessary to
ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the City of Vandalia.

of Vandalia by reason of transactions with stockholders or with other
corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates, or
transactions with such division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or
activity, or by some other method, he or she shall make such allocation as he
or she deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits
to the City of Vandalia.

the local tax has been fully withheld at no less than two percent.
(Res. 05-R-17. Passed by voters 11-8-05.)
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, or other
information as the Superintendent may require.
   (c)   The Superintendent may extend the time for filing of the annual return
upon the request of the taxpayer. The extended due date of the Vandalia return
shall not be beyond the last day of the month following the month to which the
due date for filing the Federal income tax return has been  granted by the
Internal Revenue Service. A copy of a federal extension request for the taxable
period for which an extension is requested shall be considered a request for
extension under this section, providing it is filed with the Superintendent on
or before the date the Vandalia return is required. A timely filed request for
extension of time to file shall be granted unless the taxpayer owes the City of
Vandalia any delinquent income tax or any penalty, interest, assessment or
other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax, or has failed to
file any required income tax return, report, or other related document for a
prior tax period. The granting of an extension of time for filing the return
does not extend the last date for paying the tax without penalty and interest.
   (d)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing thereof,
pay to the Superintendent the amount of taxes shown as due thereon, provided,
however, that credit shall be allowed for:
      (1)   Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at the
source pursuant to the provisions of Section
880.06;
      (2)   Any portion of said tax which shall have been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of Section
880.07; and
      (3)   Credit to the extent allowed by Section
880.15 for tax paid to another municipality.
   Subject to the limitations contained in Section
880.11, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City of
Vandalia is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his or
her election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall
be refunded.
   (e)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Section
880.11. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable upon request from
the Superintendent. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return
without the approval of the Superintendent.
   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's City of Vandalia tax liability, such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended City of Vandalia return showing income
subject to the City of Vandalia tax based upon such final determination of
Federal tax liability and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make
claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (f)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the
time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns, and the failure to
file such information returns, schedules and statements shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. However, the taxpayer shall have ten days after
notification by the Superintendent, or his or her authorized representative, to
file the items required by this subsection.
   (g)   The Superintendent shall accept a generic form of any return, report,
or document required to be filed if the generic form once completed and filed,
contains all of the information required to be submitted with the City of
Vandalia's prescribed returns, reports or documents, and if the taxpayer or
return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the rules or
ordinances of the City of Vandalia governing the filing of returns, reports or
documents.

880.06   COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer shall, at the time of the payment of any salary, wage,
commission or other compensation, deduct the tax of one percent per annum for
the period January 1, 1968, through December 31, 1982, 1.75 percent per annum
from and after January 1, 1983, and 2.0 percent per annum commencing January 1,
2006, of the qualifying  salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due
by the said employer to his or her employees who are subject to the provisions
of this chapter. In making such deduction at the time of payment, the employer
shall compute the tax to the nearest full cent so that mills of five or more
shall be increased to the next full cent and mills less than five shall be
dropped. No person shall be entitled to a refund merely because such rounding-
off of the tax results in an apparent overpayment based on his or her total
earnings. Each employer shall, on or before the last day of each month, make a
return and pay to the Superintendent the tax withheld during the preceding
month. However, the Superintendent shall have the authority to approve the
filing of returns and payment of the tax withheld on a quarterly basis. In such
case, the employer shall, on or before the last day of each month following the
calendar quarters ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, make
a return and pay to the Superintendent the tax withheld during the preceding
calendar quarter. Such approval for quarterly filings and payments may be
withdrawn by the Superintendent when it is in the best interest of the City of
Vandalia to do so. The Superintendent shall provide by regulation, the manner
in which such approval is to be granted or withdrawn.
   On and after January 1, 2003, every employer required to deduct and pay
withholding taxes shall make timely payment to the City of Vandalia by
electronic funds transfer, under regulations the Superintendent shall provide,
unless the Superintendent allows another form of payment, case by case.
   The employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax has in fact been withheld.
(Res. 05-R-17. Passed by voters 11-8-05;  Res. 10-R-07.  Passed by voters 5-4-
10.)
   (b)   The employer, in collecting said tax, shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by such employer to the City of Vandalia, as a
trustee for the benefit of the City of Vandalia, and any such tax collected by
such employer from his or her employees shall, until the same is paid to the
City of Vandalia, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
   (c)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages or other
compensation paid to domestic servants employed by him or her exclusively in or
about such person's residence, even though such residence is in the City of
Vandalia, but such employee shall be subject to all of the requirements of this
chapter.
   (d)   On or before February 28 of each year, beginning with the year 1968,
each employer shall file a withholding return on a form prescribed by and
obtainable upon request from the Superintendent, setting forth the names and
addresses of all employees from whose compensation the tax was withheld during
the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld from his or her
employees and such other information as may be required by the City of Vandalia
Income Tax Rules and Regulations.
   (e)   It shall be the responsibility of any person, as defined in Section
880.02, who is required to withhold the tax from wages of its employees under
this section, to see that all such taxes so withheld are paid to the City of
Vandalia in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. In the event taxes
withheld from the salaries of employees are not paid to the City of Vandalia in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the person shall be criminally
liable under the provisions of Sections 880.12 and 880.99.

Passed 12-23-02.)
880.07   DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Every person who anticipates the receipt of any taxable income which
is not subject to Section
880.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
subject to the tax imposed by Section
880.03, shall file a declaration setting forth such person's estimated taxable
income together with any estimated tax due thereon, if any, provided, however,
that if a person's income is wholly from wages from which the tax will be
withheld and remitted to the City of Vandalia in accordance with Section
880.06, or the tax due is fifty dollars ($50.00) or less, such person need not
file a declaration.
(Ord. 90-20. Passed 9-17-90.)
   (b)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15 of each year
during the life of this chapter, or within four months after the date the
taxpayer becomes subject to the provisions of this chapter.   Those taxpayers
reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration within three and one-
half months after the beginning of each fiscal year or period.
   (c)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by or obtainable
upon request from the Superintendent, provided, however, that credit shall be
taken for the City of Vandalia tax to be withheld from any portion of such
income to determine the estimated tax due. In accordance with the provisions of
Section
880.15 credit may be taken for tax to be paid to or to be withheld and remitted
to another taxing municipality.
   The original declaration (or any subsequent amendment thereof) may be
amended at any time.
   An amended declaration must be filed on or before January 31 of the
following year, or in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal year, on or before the
date fixed by regulation of the Superintendent if it appears that the original
declaration made for such taxable year underestimated the taxpayer's income by
ten percent or more. At such time a payment which, together with prior
payments, is sufficient to pay the taxpayer's entire estimated liability shall
be made. If upon the filing of the return required by Section
880.05, it appears that the taxpayer did not pay ninety percent of his or her
tax liability, as shown on said return, on or before January 31, or the date
fixed by regulation, whichever is applicable, the difference between ninety
percent of said taxpayer's tax liability and the amount of estimated tax
actually paid on or before January 31, or the date fixed by regulation,
whichever is applicable, shall be subject to the interest and penalty
provisions of Section
880.10.
   (d)   Such declaration of net estimated tax to be paid the City of Vandalia
shall be accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the estimated
annual tax, less credit.  For all taxpayers, at least a similar amount shall be
paid on or before the last day of the seventh, tenth and thirteenth months
after the beginning of the taxable year. For business entity taxpayers, at
least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the fifteenth day of the
sixth, ninth and twelfth months after the beginning of the taxable year. 
However, in case an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments on or before the
remaining payment dates. Furthermore, the last quarterly payment of estimated
tax need not be made if the taxpayer files his or her final return and pays the
balance of the tax due thereon within forty-five days following the end of the
taxable year.
   (e)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the calendar or
fiscal year following that for which such declaration or amended declaration
was filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the
City of Vandalia shall be paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of
Section
880.05.
(Ord. 67-26. Passed 12-4-67; Ord. 02-24. Passed 12-23-02.)
880.08   DUTIES AND POWERS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF TAXATION.
   (a)   It shall be the duty of the Superintendent to receive the tax imposed
by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein from the taxpayers; to keep an
accurate record thereof; and to report daily all monies so received.
   It shall be the duty of the Superintendent to enforce payment of all taxes
owing the City of Vandalia, to keep accurate records for a minimum of five
years showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration
and/or make any return, including taxes withheld, and to show the dates and
amounts of payments thereof.
   (b)   The Superintendent is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of
the City Council by motion, to adopt, promulgate and enforce rules and
regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection of
taxes and the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter,
including provisions for the reexamination and correction of returns. The
Superintendent shall make electronic versions of any rules or ordinances
governing the income tax available to the public through the internet, and
shall comply with the provisions of Ohio R.C. 718.07.
   (c)   In any case where a taxpayer or employer has failed to file a return
or has filed a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the
Superintendent may assess the amount of tax appearing to be due, together with
interest and penalties thereon, if any, in the following manner:
      (1)   General provisions.
         A.   If the Superintendent determines that any taxpayer subject to the
provisions of this chapter has a tax liability for which he or she has filed no
return or has filed an incorrect return and has failed to pay the full amount
of tax due, the Superintendent shall issue a proposed assessment showing the
amount of tax due, together with any penalty and interest that may have accrued
thereon.
            1   Such proposed assessment shall be served upon the taxpayer in
person or by mailing to his or her last known address. Proof of mailing
furnished by the U.S. Post Office shall be presumptive proof of receipt thereof
by the addressee.
            2.   A taxpayer may, within thirty days after the date the proposed
assessment was served or mailed, file a written protest with the
Superintendent. Within thirty days after receipt of the protest, the
Superintendent shall give the taxpayer an opportunity to be heard, provided
that the Superintendent may extend the date of hearing for good cause shown.
After the hearing the Superintendent shall withdraw the assessment or he or she
shall adjust or reaffirm the assessment, and it shall then become final. If no
protest is filed as herein provided, such proposed assessment shall become
final thirty days after being served.
         B.   After a proposed assessment becomes final, notice of such final
assessment shall be issued and shall be served in the same manner as a proposed
assessment.
            1.   A taxpayer shall have thirty days after the date the final
assessment was served or mailed within which to file written notice of appeal
with the Board of Tax Appeals. Such written notice of appeal shall be filed in
a sealed envelope plainly marked "Appeal to Board of Tax Appeals" and mailed or
delivered to the Superintendent, who shall, within five days after receipt
thereof, deliver such appeal to the Chairman of the Board of Tax Appeals, or,
if the Chairman is not available, to the Vice-Chairman.
            2.   The Board of Tax Appeals, upon receipt of a notice of appeal,
shall within fifteen days notify the Superintendent thereof who shall forward
within fifteen days to the Board a certified transcript of all actions taken by
him or her with respect to said final assessment. Such transcript shall be open
to inspection by the appellant and his, her or its counsel.
            3.   Any taxpayer against whom a final assessment has been issued
and who has filed a notice of appeal shall be granted a hearing by the Board of
Tax Appeals. At such hearing the appellant and the Superintendent shall be
given opportunity to present evidence relating to the said final assessment.
Within ninety days after the conclusion of such hearing, the Board of Tax
Appeals shall affirm, reverse or modify the said final assessment and shall
furnish a copy of its decision in respect thereof to the appellant and the
Superintendent. The appellant's copy of said decision shall be served upon him,
her or it within fifteen days after the decision is made, in the same manner as
herein provided for the serving of assessments.
         C.   When any taxpayer subject to the provisions of this chapter has
filed a return indicating the amount of tax due and has failed to pay said tax
to the Superintendent as required by this chapter, the Superintendent need not
issue an assessment but may proceed under the provisions of Sections 880.11,
880.12 and 880.99.
      (2)   Provisions affecting employers.
         A.   If the Superintendent determines that an employer subject to the
provisions of this chapter has failed to file a return for tax withheld and has
failed to pay to the Superintendent the full amount of said taxes, the
Superintendent shall issue a proposed assessment showing the amount of tax due,
together with any penalties and interest that may have accrued thereon, and the
provisions of paragraphs (c)(1)A. and B. hereof shall then apply.
         B.   If the Superintendent determines that an employer subject to the
provisions of this chapter has failed to withhold tax, the Superintendent shall
issue a proposed assessment showing the tax due, together with any penalties
and interest that may have accrued thereon, and the provisions of paragraphs
(c)(1)A. and B. hereof shall then apply.
         C.   When an employer subject to the provisions of this chapter has
filed a return indicating the amount of tax withheld and has failed to pay said
tax to the Superintendent as required by this chapter, the Superintendent may
proceed under the provisions of Sections 880.11, 880.12 and 880.99 and need not
issue an assessment as provided in paragraphs (c)(2)A. and B. hereof.
   (d)   Any taxpayer or employer who has not filed a notice of appeal to the
Board of Tax Appeals from a final assessment issued against him or her shall
pay the amount thereof within fifteen days after service of such final
assessment.
   Any taxpayer or employer who has filed a notice of appeal to the Board of
Tax Appeals from a final assessment issued against him or her shall pay the
amount determined to be due by the Board of Tax Appeals within fifteen days
after service of his or her copy of the decision of the Board.
   (e)   The Superintendent shall have the authority, when requested by the
taxpayer and for good cause shown, to extend the time of making and filing any
return whenever he or she deems it necessary so to do, but not to exceed a
period of six months, or one month beyond any extension requested of or granted
by the Internal Revenue Service for the filing of the Federal income tax
return.
   (f)   When an application for deferred payment of tax due is filed by a
taxpayer, the Superintendent may authorize partial payments of unpaid taxes
when, in his or her judgment, the taxpayer is unable, due to hardship
conditions, to pay the full amount of the tax when due, and when, in his or her
judgment, such deferred payments are the best means of accomplishing the intent
of this chapter. However, the Superintendent shall not authorize an extension
of time for the payment of said taxes due for more than six months beyond the
date of the filing of the application.
(Ord. 67-26. Passed 12-4-67.)
   (g)   Subject to the consent of the majority of the Board of Adjudication,
the Superintendent shall have the power to compromise any liability imposed by
this chapter.

to examine the books, papers, records and copies of Federal income tax returns
of any employer or of any taxpayer or person subject to, or whom the
Superintendent believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter, for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made, or, if no return was
made, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Every such employer,
supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer, is hereby directed and
required to furnish within ten days following a written request by the
Superintendent, or his or her duly authorized agent or employee, the means,
facilities and opportunity for making such examinations and investigations as
are hereby authorized.
   (b)   The Superintendent is hereby authorized to order any person presumed
to have knowledge of the facts to appear before him or her and may examine such
person under oath, concerning any income which was or should have been returned
for taxation or any transaction tending to affect such income, and for this
purpose may compel the production of books, papers, records and copies of
Federal income tax returns and the attendance of all persons before him or her,
whether as parties or witnesses, whenever he or she believes such persons have
knowledge of such income or information pertinent to such inquiry.
   (c)   The refusal to produce books, papers, records and copies of Federal
income tax returns, the refusal to submit to such examination by any employer
or person subject or presumed to be subject to the tax or by any officer, agent
or employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax, or the
failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section or with an
order or subpoena of the Superintendent authorized hereby, shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter, punishable as provided in Section
880.99.
   (d)   Any information gained as the result of any returns, investigations,
hearings or verifications required or authorized by this chapter shall be
confidential, except for official purposes, or except when ordered by a court
of competent jurisdiction. No person shall divulge such information in
violation of this chapter.
   (e)   Every taxpayer shall retain all records necessary to compute his or
her tax liability for a period of five years from the date his or her return is
filed, or the withholding taxes are paid.
(Ord. 67-26. Passed 12-4-67; Ord. 02-24. Passed 12-23-02.)
880.10   INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   All taxes imposed and all monies withheld or required to be withheld
by employers under the provisions of this chapter and remaining unpaid ten days
after they become due shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half
percent per month or any portion thereof.
   (b)   In addition to interest as provided in subsection (a) hereof,
penalties based on the unpaid tax are hereby imposed as follows:
      (1)   For failure to pay taxes due, other than taxes withheld: one-half
of one percent per month or fraction thereof, or ten percent, whichever is
greater.
      (2)   For failure to remit taxes withheld from employees: three percent
per month or fraction thereof, or ten percent, whichever is greater.
      (3)   Where the taxpayer has failed to file a declaration on which he or
she has estimated and paid a tax equal to or greater than the tax paid for the
previous year, or has failed to file a declaration on which he or she has
estimated and paid tax equal to or greater than ninety percent of the actual
tax for the year, or has failed to file a final return and pay the total tax on
or before the end of the month following the end of his or her taxable year:
ten percent of the difference between ninety percent of the actual tax for the
year and the amount paid through withholding or declaration.
      (4)   Except in the case of fraud, the penalty shall not exceed fifty
percent of the unpaid tax.
   (c)   A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax assessment made
by the Superintendent when a return has been filed in good faith and the tax
paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Superintendent, provided that,
in the absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any
additional tax assessment resulting from a Federal audit, provided an amended
return is filed and the additional tax is paid within three months after final
determination of the Federal tax liability.
   (d)   Upon recommendation of the Superintendent, the Board of Adjudication
may abate penalty or interest, or both.
   (e)   In no case shall penalty and interest charges be levied when the total
of such penalty and interest amounts to less than five dollars ($5.00).
   (f)   Any person required to withhold the tax who knowingly fails to
withhold such tax, or to pay over such tax, or knowingly attempts in any manner
to evade or defeat such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other
penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of
the tax evaded, or not withheld, or not paid over. No other penalty under this
section shall be applied to any offense to which this penalty is applied.
   (g)   Interest but no penalty will be assessed where an extension has been
granted by the Superintendent and the final tax paid within the period as
extended.
   (h)   A late filing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) is hereby
established, with this charge to be assessed for failure to or refusal to file
a City income tax return each year whether or not a tax is due. This late fee
shall not be assessed against an individual taxpayer for the first year for
which a return was required to be filed, providing the taxpayer files a
complete return within six months after notification by the Superintendent to
the taxpayer of the filing requirement.

any interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as other debts are recoverable.
Except in the case of fraud, omission of twenty-five percent of income subject
to this tax, or failure to file a return, an additional assessment shall not be
made after three years from the time the return was due or filed, whichever is
later, provided, however, that in those cases in which the Commissioner of

of limitations, the period within which an additional assessment may be made by
the Superintendent shall be one year from the time of the final determination
of the Federal tax liability.
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund
is made within three years from the date on which such payment was made or the
return was due, or within three months after final determination of the Federal
tax liability, whichever is later.
(Ord. 67-26. Passed 12-4-67.)

881.01   PURPOSE.
   The purposes of these Rule and Regulations are to assist the Tax Department
and taxpayers to comply with the Tax Ordinance and to provide fair and
consistent application of the Tax Ordinance to similarly situated taxpayers. 
These Rules and Regulations shall be deemed to be authoritative interpretations
of provisions in the Ordinance.
(Ord. 67-28.  Passed 12-4-67; Ord. 02-24.  Passed 12-23-02.)
881.02   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in these Rules and Regulations, the following words shall have the
meaning ascribed to them in this section, unless the context clearly indicates
or requires a different meaning.
   (a)   "Business" means an enterprise, activity, profession, trade or
undertaking of any nature conducted for profit or ordinarily conducted for
profit, whether by an individual, partnership, association, corporation or any
other entity.  The ordinary administration of a decedent's estate by the
administrator or executor is not to be construed as a business within this
definition.
   (b)   "Business apportionment" means the portion of net profits to be
allocated as having been earned within the City of Vandalia. That percentage
may be determined by actual books and records verifying such amounts or, in the
absence of actual books and records, by the application of the three-factor
formula of property, payroll, and sales as provided in the Income Tax
Ordinance.
   (c)   "City" means the City of Vandalia, Ohio.
   (d)   "Domicile" means that place where an individual has his or her true,
fixed, and permanent home, and principal establishment, and to which whenever
he or she is absent he or she has the intention of returning.  A "domicile" is
a permanent legal residence that a taxpayer intends to use for an indefinite
period and continues in one place until another permanent home and principal
establishment is acquired.  Some factors used to determine domicile are:
addresses used for federal and state income tax filings; business, social and
family ties to a community; voting registration and place actually voted;
automobile registrations and driver's license; where children attend school and
length of time there; social security records; employer records; being shown as
a dependent on the tax return of a parent or guardian; and, if married, where
the family resides.  This is not an all- inclusive list and other factors may
be considered as necessary.  A domicile once acquired is presumed to continue
until it is shown to have been changed.  Temporary changes of residence do not
usually affect changes in domicile.  College students whose parents are in the
City, although they may be away from the home in which they maintain a room or
significant presence for indefinite periods, are normally considered to be
domiciled in the City until such time as they become self-supporting and meet
other domicile determination factors as listed above.  When a taxpayer has
previously been domiciled in the City but whose domicile has changed, such
change may be indicated as a part of the filing of their final Vandalia
return.  If a return is not required, a written notice should be submitted to
the tax division with both current and previous addresses.
   (e)   "Employee" means one who works for wages, salary, commission or any
other types of compensation in the service of an employer.  Anyone for whom an
employer is required to withhold for Federal, State or Social Security or
Medicare purposes, or for whom worker's compensation premiums or unemployment
tax contributions are required to be paid shall be considered an employee.
   (f)   "Employer" means an individual, partnership, corporation, including
not-for-profit corporations, association, governmental agency or any other
entity who or that employs one or more persons and pays, allocates or sets
aside a salary, wage, commission or any other type of compensation.  To be an
employer does not require that business be conducted.
   (g)   "Federal Income Tax" means the tax required to be paid by a taxpayer
pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code.
   (h)   "Federal Income Tax return" means the tax return filed by the taxpayer
pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code.
   (i)   "Fiscal year" means an accounting period of 12 months or less ending
on any day other than December 31. Only fiscal years accepted by the Internal
Revenue Service for Federal income tax purposes may be used for City tax
purposes.
   (j)   "Gross receipts" means total income from any source whatsoever.  Gross
receipts shall include, but not be limited to, income in the form of
commissions, fees, rentals from real estate and tangible personal property, and
other compensation for work done or services provided as well as income from
sales of stock-in-trade.
   (k)   "Joint Economic Development District" means districts created under
Ohio R.C. 715.70 and 715.71, as amended from time to time.
   (l)   "Net profit" for a taxpayer other than an individual means adjusted
federal taxable income as defined in the Ohio Revised Code. "Net profit" for a
taxpayer that is an individual means the profit required for federal tax
purposes to be reported on Schedule C, Schedule E, Schedule F or any other
schedule of income and expenses as reportable for federal income tax purposes.
Such net profit generally is comprised of the net gain from the operation of a
business, profession, enterprise or other activity carried on for profit or
normally carried on for profit after provisions for ordinary and necessary
expenses either paid or accrued in accordance with the accounting system used
by the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes but without the deduction of
taxes imposed by the Income Tax Ordinance or Federal, State or other taxes
based on income, and in the case of an association or partnership, without the
deduction of salaries, wages or other compensation or payments to partners or
other owners.  Net profits, as disclosed on any return filed pursuant to the
Income Tax Ordinance and these Rules and Regulations, shall be calculated using
the same accounting method used in reporting net income to the Federal Internal
Revenue Service, provided that such method does not conflict with any
provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance or the Ohio Revised Code; and such net
profits must be reconciled with the income reported to the Federal Internal
Revenue Service. 
   (m)   "Ordinance", "this Ordinance", "the Ordinance" or "the Income Tax
Ordinance" means
Chapter 880 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Vandalia, Ohio and any
amendments or supplements thereto.
   (n)   "Other activity" means any undertaking, not otherwise specifically
defined herein, which is normally entered into for profit, including, but not
limited to, rental of real and personal property and a business conducted by a
trust or guardianship estate.
   (o)   "Other entity" means any person, business or enterprise not otherwise
specifically defined herein.
   (p)   "Partnership" means an association, joint venture or any form of
unincorporated enterprise owned by two or more persons.
   (q)   "Person" means every natural person, partnership, fiduciary,
association or corporation. Whenever used in any section prescribing and
imposing a penalty or interest, the term "person" includes an officer or
employee of a corporation, or a member or employee of a partnership, or in the
case of an unincorporated entity not having a partner, member or officer, any
employee or agent of such entity, who, as such officer, employee, agent or
member, has control, supervision or is charged with the responsibility of tax
law compliance or is under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the
violation resulting in said penalty or interest occurs.
   (r)   "Place of business" means any office, factory, warehouse, storage
area, distribution center, building or other space which is occupied or used by
the taxpayer in carrying out any business activity.
   (s)   "Resident" means an individual domiciled in the City of Vandalia or
any person who maintains a place of abode within the City for a total of 183
days or more within any 12-month period.
   (t)   "Resident unincorporated business entity" means an unincorporated
business entity having a place of business within the City of Vandalia.
   (u)   "Taxable income" means qualifying wages, salaries, commissions and any
other compensation earned, received, accrued or in any other way set apart by
an employer or employers before any deduction other than ordinary and necessary
business expenses as properly reported for federal income tax purposes and
actually deducted for federal income tax purposes, and/or the net profits from
the operation of a business, profession or other activity or enterprise
adjusted in accordance with provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance and with
these Rules and Regulations, and/or all other income from whatever source that
is not exempt from municipal taxation per the Ohio Revised Code.
   When used in these Rules and Regulations, the singular shall include the
plural and the masculine shall include the feminine and neuter.
(Ord. 67-28.  Passed 12-4-67; Ord. 02-24.  Passed 12-23-02.)
881.03   IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   Resident Employees.  An annual tax as set forth in the Income Tax
Ordinance shall be imposed upon the taxable income of all residents of the
City.  The source of the earnings and the place where work or services were
performed is immaterial.  All earnings of residents wherever earned or paid are
subject to Vandalia taxation.  Taxable items include but are not limited to:
      (1)   Qualifying salaries, wages, commissions, incentive payments,
bonuses and other compensation earned, received, accrued or in any other way
set apart unto residents of the City whether paid directly or through an agent
and whether in cash or in property during the tax period as:
         A.   An officer, director or employee of a corporation, including
charitable and other nonprofit organizations.
         B.   An employee (as distinguished from a partner or member) of a
partnership, association or any form of unincorporated entity owned by two or
more persons.
         C.   An employee (as distinguished from a proprietor) of a business,
trade or profession conducted by an individual owner.
         D.   An officer or employee (whether elected, appointed or
commissioned) of the United States Government or any of its agencies or of a
corporation created, owned or controlled by the United States Government or of
the State of Ohio or any of its political subdivisions or agencies or any
foreign country or dependency except military on active duty.
         E.   An employee of any other entity or person whether based on
hourly, daily, weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, annual, unit of production or
piece work rates; and whether paid by an individual, partnership, association,
corporation, including nonprofit and charitable corporations, governmental
administration, agency, authority, board, branch, bureau, department,
subdivision, section or unit or any other entity.
   (2)   Commissions earned, received, accrued or in any other way set apart
unto residents of the City whether paid directly or through an agent and
whether paid in cash or property regardless of how calculated or by whom paid
or where such payment is made.
         A.   If amounts received as a drawing account exceed the commissions
earned, the tax shall be on the gross amounts received, unless the excess is
subject to the demand of the employer for repayment.
         B.   If commissions are included in the net earnings of a trade,
business, profession, enterprise or other activity carried on by an
unincorporated entity of which the individual receiving such compensation is
owner or part owner and therefore subject to the tax through the entity, the
individual shall not be subject to the tax on the same commissions.
      (3)   Amounts received from an employer for expenses and used as such by
the individual receiving them are not deemed to be compensation subject to
taxation if the employer deducts such expenses or advances from gross income
for the purpose of determining net profits taxable under federal law and the
employee is not required to include such receipts as income on his or her
federal income tax return.  However, expense allowances or advances received
that are in excess of actual expenses are taxable by the recipient individual
employee.
      (4)   Fees, unless such fees are includable as part of the net profits of
a trade, business, profession or enterprise regularly carried on by an
unincorporated entity owned or partly owned by said individual and such net
profits are subject to the tax.  The term "fees" shall include honorariums,
marriage and funeral offerings, gratuities received in the performance of
religious ceremonies and other monies received by members of the clergy,
evangelists or religious workers.
      (5)   Other compensation, in addition to items mentioned elsewhere in
these Rules and Regulations, including but not limited to bonuses, stipends,
tips, other earned income, supplemental unemployment benefits (S.U.B. pay),
income from partnerships, estates or trusts, employee contributions to costs of
fringe benefits, ordinary gains as reported on Federal Form 4797, recapture of
depreciation, vacation pay, farm net income, employer paid premiums for group
term life insurance in the same amounts as taxable to the employee for federal
tax purposes, contributions made on behalf of employees to tax deferred annuity
programs, income from guaranteed annual wage contracts, prizes and gifts of any
type if connected with employment, stock options (taxed) when exercised,
usually valued at market price less the option price at the date the option is
exercised, director fees, income from jury duty, union steward fees, strike
pay, profit sharing, uniform, automobile and travel allowances, gambling and
lottery winnings, reimbursements in excess of deductible expenses, executor
fees, pre-retirement distributions from retirement plans, amounts received from
covenants not to compete to the extent includable on the taxpayer's Federal
income tax return, other income as taxable for the purpose of Federal income
tax including but not limited to employer-provided educational assistance and
other types of income earned, received accrued or in any other way set apart or
deemed as ordinary income for Federal income tax purposes, including
compensation paid to domestic, casual or other types of employees.  All
qualifying wages appearing on a W-2 shall be considered as taxable to the
recipient and will not be excluded from taxable income unless it can be shown
to be an exception in accordance with the Income Tax Ordinance and these Rules
and Regulations.
      (6)   In the case of domestic employees or other employees whose duties
require them to live at their place of employment or assignment, board and
lodging shall not be taxable as wages or compensation.
      (7)   Sick pay, disability pay, long-term disability pay, vacation pay,
wage or salary continuation plan payments and other payments made to an
employee by an employer or a third party agent during periods of absence from
work are taxable when paid and at the rate in effect at time of payment and may
not be excluded from taxable income by an employer, resident or nonresident
employee.  Disability benefits received from a policy in which the taxpayer has
paid the premiums will not be taxable to the City to the extent that the
benefits received are a result of such premiums.  Benefits from disability
policies of which the premiums are partially employer paid and partially
employee paid are taxable only on the employer paid portion.
      (8)   Payments made to an employee by an employer as separation pay,
severance pay, termination pay, early retirement incentives and similar pay-
outs are taxable when paid. 
      (9)   Employee contributions to retirement plans, including Internal
Revenue Code Sections 401(k), 403(b), 457 and other deferred compensation
plans, are taxable and are neither excludable nor deductible by the employee. 
Withholding applies to the employee's full compensation unreduced by an
employee's contribution to a retirement or deferral plan.  If an employer pays
into a tax sheltered or tax deferred plan on behalf of an employee, or makes
any similar type payments that may be in lieu of paying additional wages or
other compensation, those payments are taxable and subject to withholding.
      (10)   Contributions made either by or on behalf of an employee to
cafeteria-type plans that are includable in Federal Medicare wages, are fully
taxable and may not be excluded or deducted from taxable income by either an
employee or employer.  Federal wage reductions do not cause a fully taxable
wage or salary to lose its character as a fully taxable wage or salary subject
to the provisions of the City Income Tax Ordinance or these Rules and
Regulations, unless such reductions are includable in the calculation of
qualifying wage per the Ohio Revised Code.  Contributions to the costs of such
benefits, when includable in qualifying wages, whether paid directly or through
a payroll deduction plan, are not deductible from and should be included in
taxable income.  Employer-sponsored benefit plans that permit the participant
employee to reduce taxable income for Federal income tax purposes are not
recognized for City income tax purposes if contributions to such plans arc
includable in federal Medicare wages.  Such a reduction does not cause the
gross wage or salary to lose its character or taxability or withholding
requirements for City purposes.
      (11)   Where compensation is paid or received in property, its fair
market value, at the time of receipt, shall be subject to the tax and to
withholding.  Board, lodging and similar items received by an employee in lieu
of additional cash compensation shall be included in earnings at their fair
market value.  Gifts to employees of a minimal amount that may be given by
employers during holidays or other occasions are taxable only to the extent
that they are subject to taxation for federal income tax purposes.
   (b)   Nonresident Employees.  An annual tax as set forth in the Income Tax
Ordinance shall be imposed on the taxable income of all nonresidents of the
City on qualifying salaries, wages, commissions, incentive payments, bonuses,
and other compensation earned, received accrued or in any other way set apart
unto nonresidents of the City for work done or services performed within the
City whether such compensation is received or earned directly or through an
agent and whether paid in cash or property.  The location of the place from
which payment is made is immaterial.  The items subject to the tax for
nonresidents of the City are the same as those listed and defined in these
Rules and Regulations as subject to the tax for residents of the City.  A
nonresident individual who is in the employment of a nonresident business and
in the course of said employment works or performs services in the City for 12
or fewer days within a calendar year shall be considered an occasional or
casual entrant and shall not be subject to Vandalia income tax for those 12 or
fewer days.  For the purposes of the 12-day calculation, any portion of a day
worked in the City shall be construed and counted as one day worked in the
City.  If said individual works or performs services in the City for 13 or more
days during a calendar year, on the thirteenth day of said calendar year, the
individual shall no longer be considered an occasional or casual entrant and
shall be subject to taxation on all income earned in the City, including that
earned during the first 12 days.
      (1)   If said individual can be reasonably defined as a professional
entertainer, a professional athlete, a promoter of a professional sports or
entertainment event or an employee of such a promoter, the herein-defined 12-
day occasional or casual entrant provision for nonresidents shall not apply.
      (2)   Vandalia income tax withheld by a nonresident employer and paid to
the City as a result of the employer being subject to withholding rules, as
defined in these Rules and Regulations, cannot be refunded to an individual
under the 12-day occasional or casual entrant provision.
   (c)   Resident Unincorporated Businesses.  In the case of resident
unincorporated businesses, professions, enterprises or other activities
conducted, operated or engaged in, irrespective of whether such taxpayer has an
office or place of business in the City, there is imposed an annual tax, as set
forth in the Income Tax Ordinance, on the net profits earned, received,
accrued, set apart or derived from sales made, work done, services performed,
or business or other activities conducted in the City.
      (1)   The tax imposed on resident partnerships, associations, joint
ventures or other unincorporated entities owned by two or more persons is upon
the entities rather than the individual owners or members.
      (2)   The tax imposed on a resident unincorporated entity owned by one
person is upon the individual owner.  Net profits from self-employment,
professions, sole proprietorships and other unincorporated entities owned by
one person are subject to the tax.
      (3)   The tax is imposed on all resident unincorporated entities having
net profits attributable to the City under the method of allocation provided in
the Income Tax Ordinance and in these Rules and Regulations regardless of where
the owner or owners of such resident unincorporated business entity reside.
      (4)   Resident unincorporated entities owned by two or more persons, all
of whom are residents of the City, shall disregard any method of allocation and
shall be subject to the tax on the entire net profits.
      (5)   A resident individual who is sole owner of a resident
unincorporated entity shall be subject to tax on the entire net profits of said
business and shall disregard any method of allocation. 
      (6)   In the case of a resident individual partner, member or part owner
of a resident unincorporated business entity, the tax is imposed on said
individual's distributive share of net profits earned, received, accrued, set
apart or derived by the entity but not attributed to the City under the method
of allocation set forth in the Income Tax Ordinance and these Rules and
Regulations and not taxed against the entity.
   (d)   Nonresident Unincorporated Businesses.  In the case of nonresident
unincorporated businesses, professions, enterprises or other activities
conducted, operated or engaged in, there is imposed an annual tax as set forth
in the Income Tax Ordinance on the net profits earned, received, accrued, set
apart or derived that are attributable to the City.
      (1)   The tax imposed on nonresident partnerships, associations, joint
ventures or other unincorporated entities owned by two or more persons is upon
the entities rather than the individual owners or members. 
      (2)   The tax imposed on a nonresident unincorporated entity owned by one
person is upon the individual owner.
      (3)   The tax is imposed on all nonresident unincorporated entities
having net profits attributable to the City under the method of allocation
provided in the Income Tax Ordinance and in these Rules and Regulations
regardless of where the owner or owners of such nonresident unincorporated
business entity reside.
      (4)   Nonresident unincorporated entities owned by two or more persons,
all of whom are residents of the City, shall disregard any method of allocation
and shall be subject to the tax on the entire net profits.  In such case, the
tax paid by the entity shall constitute all tax due from the owners or members
for their distributive share of net profits.  However, an additional return
shall be required from such owner or member and such return shall report any
taxable income other than the distributive share of net profits from the
entity.
      (5)   A resident individual who is sole owner of a nonresident
unincorporated entity shall be subject to tax on the entire net profits of said
business and shall disregard any method of allocation.
      (6)   In the case of a resident individual partner, member or part owner
of a nonresident unincorporated business entity, the tax is imposed on said
individual's distributive share of net profits earned, received, accrued, set
apart or derived by the entity but not attributed to the City under the method
of allocation set forth in the Income Tax Ordinance and these Rules and
Regulations and not taxed against the entity.
   (e)   Corporations.  In the case of corporations, whether domestic of
foreign and whether or not such corporations have an office or place of
business in the City, there is imposed an annual tax as set forth by the Income
Tax Ordinance on the net profits earned, received, accrued, set apart or
derived that are attributable to the City.
      (1)   There is in the Income Tax Ordinance and these Rules and
Regulations a method of allocation that will determine if a corporation is
conducting a business or other activity in the City and the amount of net
profits subject to taxation by the City.
      (2)   Corporations required by provisions of the Ohio Revised Code to pay
an excise tax may exclude from calculations of net profits subject to the tax
imposed by the Income Tax Ordinance, that portion of their gross receipts upon
which the excise tax is paid.  Accordingly, expenses incurred in the production
of such gross receipts shall not be deducted in calculating said net profits
subject to the tax.
      (3)   Distributions to shareholders of S-corporations are not subject to
taxation by the City.  Conversely, losses derived from S-corporations may not
be used to offset other income that may be subject to City taxation. 
      (4)   S-corporations are required to file on an entity basis and pay the
tax due on any net profits attributable to the City in the same manner as all
other types of corporations that are subject to the tax.  The tax is imposed
upon the S-corporation net profits attributable to the City per the three-
factor business apportionment formula without regard for where the owners,
shareholders or members reside.
   (f)   Royalties.  Royalties derived from land leases, coal, gravel and other
mineral rights, oil and gas wells whether managed, extracted or operated by the
taxpayer individually or through an agent or other representative are subject
to taxation by the City.  Royalties derived from intangible property, patents
and copyrights are not taxable unless the taxpayer's activities produce a
publication or other product which results in sales from which royalties are
produced.  Such items shall be clearly disclosed as an attachment to the City
tax return.
   (g)   Rentals.  An annual tax as set forth in the Income Tax Ordinance shall
be imposed on rental earnings from all types of real estate or other property
that is located within the City and from the rental earnings of City residents
no matter where such rental property is located.  The owner or owners of the
property shall declare and pay the tax thereon.  Rental earnings from all types
of real estate and other property are not deemed to be earnings from a
business, as defined in the Income Tax Ordinance and these Rules and
Regulations, if the taxpayer's entire gross rental activity in aggregate is
less than three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) per month.
      (1)   "Real property", as used in these Rules and Regulations, shall
include commercial property, farm property, residential property and any and
all other types of real estate or personal property for which rents, payments
or remuneration in exchange for the use, possession or control of such property
are earned, received, accrued or in any other way set apart.
      (2)   Individuals having rental losses, but not receiving gross rents
that would average three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) per month or more over
a calendar year, must be able to verify that such property was actually
available for rent and that the rental amount was set at a reasonable fair
market value in order to use such loss to offset other taxable income.  Such
property is not considered a business for loss offset purposes.  However, all
rental net gains are taxable without regard for the average monthly rental
amount.
      (3)   In the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a percentage of
sales, receipts or profits whether or not such rental exceeds three hundred
fifty dollars ($350.00) per month.
      (4)   In the case of farm property, the owner shall be considered engaged
in business when he or she shares in the crops or when rental is based on a
percentage of gross or net receipts received from the farm whether or not such
amounts exceed three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) per month.
      (5)   A person who operates a rooming house of five or more rooms
available for rent shall be considered to be engaged in business whether or not
gross income exceeds three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) per month.
      (6)   Rentals received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of buying
and selling real estate shall be considered as part of the business income.
      (7)   In determining the taxable income from rentals, the deductible
expense amount shall be of the same nature and amount as properly reported and
actually deducted for federal income tax purposes.  In the absence of actual
books and records, the Income Tax Superintendent may estimate taxable net
rental income.
      (8)   Residents of the City are subject to taxation upon the net income
from all rentals regardless of the location of the property.
      (9)   Nonresidents of the City are subject to taxation on rentals only if
the property is located within the City.  Nonresidents, in determining whether
gross monthly rentals exceed three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00), should take
into consideration only those properties located within the City.
      (10)   Corporations owning or managing real estate or other rental
property are taxable only on that portion of income derived from property
located within the City.
      (11)   An individual, business or other entity having a rental property
that is subject to the City income tax and who or that subsequently sells such
rental property, shall attach Federal Form 4797, page 1 and 2, to the Vandalia
return for the year in which the sale is made.  Any amount or value realized on
a sale, exchange or other disposition of such rental property shall be treated
as taxable income to the extent of depreciation allowed or allowable.
      (12)   The owners of rental property located in the City shall, on or
before October 31 of each year, submit a current listing of all renters to the
City Income Tax Division.  The list shall contain the name, address and date of
occupancy of each tenant.  Any change in occupancy that occurs during the year
must be reported to the Income Tax Division immediately.  A form or forms
needed in making such reports will be furnished by the Income Tax Division and
are available upon request.  However, substitute forms are acceptable if such
forms contain the applicable information of name, address and date of occupancy
of all tenants.
   (h)   Non-taxable Income.  In addition to items mentioned elsewhere in these
Rules and Regulations, the following are examples of items that, for the
individual recipients, are exempt from the City income tax: interest,
dividends, social security benefits, income from federally qualified retirement
plans, state unemployment benefits, worker's compensation, proceeds of life
insurance policies, active duty military pay, earnings of persons under 18
years of age, capital gains, prizes and gifts not connected with employment,
annuity distributions, housing allowances for the clergy to the extent that the
allowance is used to provide a home as excluded by Section 107 of the Internal
Revenue Code, health and welfare benefits distributed by government,
charitable, religious or educational organizations.
      (1)   Proceeds from an educational scholarship, fellowship or grant is
exempt from City income tax only when given for attendance as a student at an
accredited college or university and when also exempt for federal income tax
purposes.
      (2)   Alimony is not taxed to the recipient nor is it allowed as a
deduction by the payor.
      (3)   Compensatory insurance proceeds derived from property damage or
personal injury settlements are not taxable; however, this exclusion does not
apply to any amounts of insurance proceeds paid as a replacement for lost
salaries or wages.
      (4)   Compensation paid under the Ohio Revised Code to a person serving
as a precinct election official, to the extent that such compensation is under
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) annually, is exempt from City income tax. The
payer of such precinct election official's income of under one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) annually for any individual is not required to withhold the City
income tax from that income.  However, when such compensation is one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) or more during any calendar year, it is subject to taxation
and to withholding on the full amount earned during that tax period.
      (5)   Compensation paid to an employee of a transit authority, as defined
for municipal tax purposes in the Ohio Revised Code, for operating a transit
bus or other motor vehicle for such transit authority in or through the City is
exempt from the City income tax, unless the bus or vehicle is operated on a
regularly scheduled route in the City or the employee has a residence or
domicile within the City or the transit authority headquarters is located in
the City.
   (i)   Ordinary and Necessary Expenses.  Except as provided in the Income Tax
Ordinance or elsewhere in theses Rules and Regulations, all ordinary and 
necessary expenses of operating a business that have been properly reported for
federal income tax purposes and that have been deducted for federal income tax
purposes, including reasonable compensation paid to employees, shall be
allowed.  However, no deduction may be claimed for salary or withdrawal of a
proprietor or of the partners, members or other owners of an unincorporated
business or enterprise.
   (j)   Deductibility of Taxes.  There shall be no deduction of any taxes
imposed by the Income Tax Ordinance or federal, state or any other tax based on
income.  Nor shall there be a deduction for gift, estate or inheritance taxes
or taxes for local benefits or improvements to property.  If for any reason the
income from a property is not subject to the tax imposed by the Income Tax
Ordinance,  then taxes and any other expenses of such property are not
deductible.
   (k)   Charitable Contributions.  Charitable contributions shall not be
deducted in the computation of qualifying wages for the City, nor shall
charitable contributions be deducted in the computation of City income tax of
an individual taxpayer.  Corporations, partnerships and other businesses
required to file returns on an entity basis may deduct charitable contributions
to the extent that such contributions have been deducted for Federal tax
purposes, and providing that such contributions are includable in the
computation of adjusted Federal taxable income as reportable to the City.  Such
contributions must be supported through a Federal form attached to the City
return.
   (l)   Employee Business Expenses.  Individual taxpayers having employee
expenses which are properly reportable on Federal Form 2106 and which have been
taken as a deduction for federal income tax purposes may also be entitled to a
deduction for City income tax purposes.  The total of such expenses cannot
exceed the related income from the employer of whom the expenses were
incurred.  A copy of Federal Form 2106 and Federal Schedule A must be filed as
attachments to the City annual tax return.  For City purposes, expenses
included on the Form 2106 may not be aggregated; in such case, an itemized
listing of expenses must be attached to the City return.  Employee business
expenses related to income earned in another taxing municipality shall be used
to reduce the tax due in such other municipality.  In such circumstances, any
other city tax credit allowed by the City will reflect the tax due to the other
city after the reduction of the Form 2106 expenses.
   (m)   Moving Expenses.  Individual taxpayers having moving expenses which
are properly reportable on Federal Form 3903 and which have been taken as a
deduction for federal income tax purposes may also be entitled to a deduction
for City income tax purposes.  The total of such moving expenses cannot exceed
any reimbursed amounts received or set apart unto the employee from the
employer of whom the expenses were incurred.  A copy of Federal Form 3903 and
Federal Schedule A must be filed as attachments to the City annual return. 
      (1)   Moving expense reimbursements in excess of actual expenses that are
properly reportable on Federal Form 3903 and/or not actually deducted from
federal income tax are taxable.
      (2)   Moving expenses that are not reimbursed by the employer are not
deductible.
   (n)   Expenses Attributable to Non-taxable Income.  Expenses attributable to
non-taxable income shall not be allowed as a deduction in the computation of
income subject to City taxation.  Per the Ohio Revised Code, when calculating
adjusted Federal tax income, an amount equal to 5% of the tangible income that
has been deducted in the adjusted Federal taxable income calculation will be
considered as attributable to such non-taxable income and shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
   (o)   Trucking Companies.  Net profits derived by trucking companies and
other carriers operating under a certificate issued by the P.U.C.O. are not
subject to City tax per the Ohio Revised Code exemption of motor carriers. 
Motor carriers having gross receipts derived both within and without the Ohio
Revised Code P.U.C.O. exemption are subject to the tax on that portion of their
net profits not subject to the exemption and may not deduct expenses relating
to any portion of the exempt amount of gross receipts.
   (p)   Allocation of Business Profits and Losses.
      (1)   If a corporate taxpayer doing business both within and without the
City, or a  nonresident unincorporated taxpayer doing business both within and
without the City, has actual and bona fide books and records that accurately
reflect the proper percentage of business activities within the City, such
taxpayer shall use such records.  In the absence of such records, such taxpayer
shall use the Three-Factor Business Apportionment Formula as set forth in the
Income Tax Ordinance and these Rules and Regulations.  If the books and records
of the taxpayer are used rather than the business apportionment formula, a
statement must accompany the City return explaining the manner in which such
apportionment is made in sufficient detail to enable the Superintendent to
determine whether the net profit or loss attributable to the City is
apportioned with reasonable accuracy.
      (2)   Where allocation of net profit or loss is necessary and the
taxpayer does not have appropriate actual books and records showing such
allocation, the three-factor business apportionment formula percentage shall be
calculated on the basis of:
         A.   The original cost of real and tangible personal property within
and without the City; and
         B.    The gross business receipts within and without the City; and
         C.   The wages earned within and without the City.
      (3)   Business apportionment formula method:
         A.   Step 1: Ascertain the percentage which the original cost of real
and tangible personal property, including leasehold improvements, owned or used
in the business and situated within the City is of the original cost of all
real and tangible personal property, including leasehold improvements, owned or
used in the business wherever situated, during the period covered by the
return. 
            1.   The percentage of taxpayer's real and tangible personal
property within the City is determined by dividing the original cost of such
property within the City, without deduction of any encumbrances, by the
original cost of all such property within and without the City.  In determining
such percentage, property rented to the taxpayer must be considered.  The value
of real and tangible personal property rented by the taxpayer shall be
determined by multiplying gross annual rents payable by eight. 
            2.   "Gross rents" means the actual sum of money or other form of
compensation payable by the taxpayer for the use or possession of property
whether designated as a fixed sum or as a percentage of sales or profits or
other consideration.  Any amounts such as interest, repairs, taxes, insurance
or other amounts required to be paid in lieu of rents or as an addition to
rents shall be included in gross rents.
         B.   Step 2: Ascertain the percentage which the gross receipts of the
taxpayer derived from sales made, work done and services rendered in the City
is of the total gross receipts, wherever derived, during the period covered by
the return. The following shall be considered sales and gross receipts derived
in the City:
            1.   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from
City to purchasers outside the City, regardless of where title passes if the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
            2.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered to
purchasers within the City, regardless of where title passes, even though
transported from a point outside Vandalia, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation and the sales either directly or
indirectly result from such solicitation.
            3.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered
within the City regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered from
an office, store, warehouse, factory, place of storage or other facility or
stock of goods within the City.
               a.   In application of the foregoing paragraphs, a carrier shall
be considered the agent of the seller regardless of the F.O.B. point or other
conditions of the sale, and the place at which orders are accepted or contracts
written shall be immaterial. 
               b.   Solicitation of customers outside the City by mail or phone
or fax or electronic means from an office or place of business within the City,
or when such solicitation is automatically directed to points outside the City
but was ordered or initiated in the City, shall not be considered as
solicitation of sales outside the City.
               c.   Business receipts are not considered to have been derived
by the taxpayer outside the City solely because they were payable or actually
received outside of the City.  Nor shall the fact that deliveries are made
outside the City necessarily constitute a sale for which receipts are allowable
outside the City.
               d.   Charges for work done or services performed incident to a
sale, whether or not included in the price of the property, shall be considered
gross receipts from such a sale.
         C.   Step 3: Ascertain the percentage which the total wages, salaries,
commissions and other compensation of employees within the City is of total
wages, salaries commissions and other compensation of all employees within and
without the City during the period covered by the return. 
            1.   Salaries and compensation paid to owners or credited to the
account of owners or partners during the period covered by the return are
considered wages for the purpose of this computation.
            2.   Wages, salaries and other compensation shall be calculated on
the cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method of accounting used in
the computation of the entire net income of the taxpayer.
            3.   For employees who perform services both within and without the
City,  the amount treated as compensation for services performed within the
City shall be deemed to be as follows:
               a.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends
directly on the volume of business secured, such as a salesperson on a
commission basis, the City wages, salaries and other compensation amount is the
amount received for the business attributable to the employee's efforts within
the City.
               b.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends on
other results achieved, the amount attributable to the City is the value of the
proportion of the total compensation received for services within the City.
               c.   In the case of an employee compensated on a time basis, the
amount of wages, salaries and other compensation attributable to the City is
the proportion of the total amount received for working time within the City.
         D.   Step 4: Add the percentages determined in Step 1, Step 2 and Step
3 and divide the total by the number of percentages used.  The result so
obtained is the business allocation percentage.  In determining the business
apportionment percentage through use of the three-factor formula, a factor
shall not be excluded from the computation merely because the factor is
allocable entirely within or outside of the City.  A factor is excluded only
when it does not exist anywhere. 
      (4)   The business apportionment formula shall be applied to the entire
taxable net profits of the taxpayer, wherever derived, to determine the net
profits allocable to the City.
      (5)   In the event that a just and equitable result cannot be obtained
under the standard three-factor formula, the Superintendent may substitute
other factors to be used within the formula or prescribe other methods of
allocating net income to determine a fair and proper allocation.  Application
to use substitute factors in the formula or to use a different method to
allocate net profits must be made, in writing, to the Superintendent before the
end of the taxable year.  The application shall state the specific grounds and
reasoning on which the substitution of factors or use of a different method is
requested.  No specific form need be followed in making such application.  Once
a taxpayer has filed under a substitute method, such method may not be changed
unless the Superintendent grants permission for a change.
   (q)   Nonprofit Organizations.  Any charitable, educational, fraternal or
other type of nonprofit organization that meets Ohio Revised Code requirements
for exemption from the payment of real estate taxes is exempt from the tax
imposed by the Income Tax Ordinance.  However, any such nonprofit organization
is required to file declarations and tax returns and remit the taxes imposed by
the Income Tax Ordinance, and otherwise comply with all other aspects of the
Income Tax Ordinance as with other for-profit organizations, on all business
activities of a type conducted for profit or ordinarily conducted for profit by
taxpayers operating for a profit.
      (1)   The Income Tax Superintendent is authorized to verify forms filed
with the federal government by nonprofit organizations relating to or
establishing their status for federal tax purposes; and nonprofit organizations
will keep copies of such forms available for inspection and verification.
      (2)   The exemption of the nonprofit organization from the imposition of
the tax does not extend to its employees or to its requirement to withhold and
remit taxes on salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation paid to its
employees.
   (r)   Recapture of Depreciation.  Capital gains and losses from the sale,
exchange or other disposition of property shall not be taken into consideration
in arriving at net profits earned.  However, any amount or value realized on a
sale, exchange or other disposition of tangible personal property or real
property used in business in excess of book value shall be treated as taxable
income to the extent of depreciation allowed or allowable.
   (s)   Stock Options. Any income or value received from the grant, sale,
exchange or other disposition of a stock option, the exercise of a stock option
or the sale, exchange or other disposition of stock purchased under a stock
option plan shall be included in the City taxable income of individual
taxpayers.

15-09.)
881.04   RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Date and Requirements for Filing.
      (1)   On or before April 15 of each year, every person 18 years of age or
older, subject to the provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance shall, without
assessment or notice or demand, make and file a return with the Superintendent
whether or not a tax is due.  Such return must be on a form prescribed by and
obtainable upon request from the Superintendent.  The Superintendent shall
accept a generic form of any return, report or document required to be filed if
the generic form once completed and filed, contains all the information
required to be submitted with the City prescribed returns reports or documents,
and if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form otherwise
complies with the rules and regulations and ordinances of Vandalia.
      (2)   If the return is for a fiscal year or any period less than a year,
said return shall be made within three and one-half months from the end of the
fiscal year or other period.
      (3)   The fact that a person subject to City filing requirements is not
required to file a Federal tax return does not relieve such person from filing
a City tax return.
      (4)   Individuals who are permanently retired and who have no income
subject to taxation by the City must file a return for the year following the
year in which they become permanently retired.  Subsequent filings will not be
required of those retirees receiving no income subject to taxation.  However,
such retirees may, when deemed necessary by the Superintendent, be required to
verify their Federal tax status.  Such verification will be no more than once
every three years in frequency.
         A.   Individuals that are permanently retired are required to file
annual returns until an exemption is granted, in writing, by the
Superintendent.
         B.   Anyone, including retirees, receiving a pre-printed return from
the tax office has an active account and must file a return.
      (5)   Every person subject to the provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance
shall, without assessment or notice or demand, file a return setting forth the
aggregate amount of qualifying salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned, received, accrued or in any other way set apart, and net
profits from business or other activities including the rental of real estate
and other personal property, and any other income subject to taxation under the
Income Tax Ordinance earned, received, accrued or set apart for the period
covered by the return, and such other facts and information as the
Superintendent may require.
      (6)   All returns required to be filed shall set forth the aggregate
amount of qualifying wages, salaries, bonuses, incentive payments, commissions,
fees and other compensation earned, received, accrued or in any other way set
apart and subject to the tax from each employer, taxable net profits and other
pertinent information as the Tax Superintendent may require.  In lieu of the
above, a taxpayer may submit an affidavit from the tax office of any City in
which the taxpayer worked, stating that the taxpayer has met the obligation to
file and pay the tax in that City.  This alternative is available to those
taxpayers that have income that is fully withheld upon at a rate equal to or
higher than the Vandalia rate.
      (7)   Trustees of active trusts are required to file returns and pay the
tax on the taxable income thereof.
      (8)   Fiduciaries are liable for the payment of any taxes due by a
deceased person from the estate of such deceased person.
      (9)   Nonresident employees need not file a return when their entire
earnings subject to taxation by the City of Vandalia for the tax period are
paid by an employer or employers and said employer or employers have withheld
and remitted the full and proper amount of Vandalia income tax.
      (10)   An employee who is permitted to deduct employee business expenses
from gross wages, salaries or other compensation for Federal tax purposes
through Federal Form 2106 and Federal Schedule A must file a City return in
order to claim such deductions.
      (11)   Anyone actually or constructively receiving income subject to City
taxation but not fully withheld upon must file a City return.
      (12)   Taxpayers having income, wages, salaries or other compensation for
which a return must be filed, and also having net profits subject to taxation
from an individually owned business that is not required to file on an entity
basis, are required to file only one return including all income subject to
taxation.
      (13)   Except as provided for herein, the tax is upon the partnership or
association as an entity, whether resident or nonresident, and a return is
required from the entity disclosing the net profits allocable to the City and
the tax paid thereon.  However, any resident partner or resident member of an
unincorporated entity is required to make a return and pay the tax in
accordance with the Income Tax Ordinance.
      (14)   All returns shall set forth the amount of tax imposed by the
Income Tax Ordinance on all income subject to taxation.  Any credits that may
be applicable may not be set forth until after the full and proper amount of
tax is determined and reported on said return.
      (15)   A husband and wife may file returns either individually or
jointly. 
      (16)   All returns filed must clearly indicate how taxable income was
determined.  Applicable schedules must be attached.  The Superintendent of
Taxation may require additional information to verify the accuracy of any
return and to provide documentation or verification of any items or amounts
shown on the return.
      (17)   Where amounts of total income, deductions and net profits are
included, as shown on a Federal return, any items of income that are not
subject to City tax and any unallowable expenses shall be eliminated in
determining net taxable income.
      (18)   A corporation, partnership, association, trust or other
organization required to file returns on an entity basis must show a
reconciliation of net income reported on the Federal income tax return with the
income reported on the City return.
      (19)   Operating losses (except any portion of a loss separately
reportable for municipal tax purposes to another city) from business or
professional activities, the profits of which would be subject to the tax under
the Income Tax Ordinance, may be offset against salaries, wages or other
compensation or against net profits from other business or professional
activities.  Such losses may only be deducted in the year in which they occur. 
There is no carry forward or backward of operating losses.
      (20)   If a change in Federal income tax liability made by the Internal
Revenue Service or by a judicial decision results in an additional amount of
tax payable to the City, a report of such change shall be filed within three
months after receipt of the notice from the Internal Revenue Service or court
decision.  If such change results in a reduction of taxes owed and paid to the
City, a claim for refund may be filed with the Superintendent as prescribed by
the Income Tax Ordinance.
   (b)   Extensions.
      (1)   Upon written request received on or before the due date for filing
the return, and for good cause shown, the Superintendent may, when it is deemed
to be in the best interest of the City, extend the time for filing such return
for a period not beyond the last day of the month following the month in which
the federal income tax return has been extended.
      (2)   All extensions shall be conditioned upon the taxpayer filing a
tentative return, accompanied by payment of any tax due by the date the return
is normally due, and upon the taxpayer maintaining continuing compliance with
all provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance.
      (3)   A late filing penalty shall not be assessed in those cases in which
the return is filed and the final tax paid within the period as extended
provided all other filing and payment provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance
have been met.  However, the amount by which the actual tax found to be due
exceeds the payment submitted with the tentative return shall bear late payment
penalty and interest from the original due date of the return.
      (4)   Extensions granted by the Superintendent are done so with the
understanding that the declaration, filing and payment requirements have been
fulfilled.  However, if upon further examination, it becomes evident that such
requirements have not been met, interest and penalties shall be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.
   (c)   Payment with Return.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing, without
assessment or notice or demand, pay the amount of taxes shown to be due
thereon.
      (2)   A taxpayer who has made and filed a complete return and who has
overpaid the amount of tax due may have such overpayment refunded or applied
against the next year estimated tax due at his or her election as indicated on
the return.  When no such election has been indicated by the taxpayer, any
overpayment will be credited to the next tax year.  All overpayments will be
transferred first to any tax year in which there is a delinquent balance due
before such overpayment will be credited forward to pay estimated taxes or be
refunded.
      (3)   No tax shall be collected and no overpayment shall be refunded or
applied against subsequent liabilities when less than one dollar ($1.00).
   (d)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of any tax
overpaid, subject to the provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance.  Such amended
return shall be on a form prescribed by the Superintendent of Taxation.  A
taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or apportionment of net
profits after the due date for filing the original return without prior
approval of the Superintendent.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended City return showing income subject to the tax based upon
the final federal tax liability, and pay any additional tax due or make claim
for refund of any overpayment.
   (e)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   Consolidated returns may be filed by a group of corporations that
are affiliated through stock ownership, provided such group files consolidated
returns for federal income tax purposes.
      (2)   For a subsidiary corporation to be included in a consolidated
return, 80% or more of its stock must be owned by the other members of the
affiliated group.
      (3)   A consolidated return must include all companies that are so
affiliated.
      (4)   Once a consolidated return has been filed for any taxable year, the
consolidated group must continue to file consolidated returns in subsequent
years unless:
         A.   Permission, in writing, is granted by the Tax Superintendent; or
         B.   A new corporation, other than a corporation created or organized
by a member of the group, has become a member of the group during the taxable
year; or
         C.   A corporation member of the group is sold or exchanged.
      (5)   Liquidating a corporation or merging one of the corporations of the
group into another member of the group will not qualify the group for filing
separate returns.
      (6)   If a corporation becomes a member of the group during the taxable
year, the consolidated return must include the income from the entire year of
the parent corporation and any subsidiaries which were members of the group for
the entire year, plus the income of each subsidiary that becomes a member of
the group during the year for the period beginning with the date it became a
member of the affiliated group.  For the period prior to the time any
subsidiary became a member of the group, separate returns must be filed for
that subsidiary.  When a subsidiary ceases to be a member of the affiliated
group, the consolidated return must include the income of such subsidiary for
the period during which it was a member, but for the period after it ceases to
be a member of the group, separate returns must be filed.  If a corporation has
been a member of the affiliated group for less than a month of the taxable year
of the group, it may be considered as not being part of the group.  Similarly,
a subsidiary may be considered as being a member of the affiliated group during
the entire taxable year of the group if the period during which it was not a
member does not exceed one month.
      (7)   If a subsidiary is a member of a consolidated group for only part
of a taxable year, the income considered to be earned in such fractional part
of the year shall be prorated accordingly.
      (8)   In determining the allocation fraction where a corporation becomes
a member of the consolidated group or ceases to be a member during the taxable
year, the property factor (Step 1 of the Three-Factor Business Apportionment
Formula as provided in the Income Tax Ordinance and these Rules and
Regulations) shall be determined on the basis of original cost of the property
during the period such corporation was a member of the group.  The rental
portion of the factor, however, shall be calculated at eight times the annual
rent.  The gross receipts and wage factors shall be based on the actual
amounts.
      (9)   All subsidiary corporations filing as a part of a consolidated
group shall be liable for the tax as well as the parent corporation.
      (10)   In consolidating the net income, the taxable income of each
corporation shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions governing the
taxable income of separate corporations except that there shall be eliminated
unrealized profits and loses in transactions between members of the affiliated
group.
      (11)   In determining expenses that are not allowable because they are
allocable to non- taxable income, such calculations shall be based on the
consolidated net income.
   (f)   Operating Losses.
      (1)   Net losses (except any portion of a loss separately reportable for
municipal tax purposes to another city) incurred during any taxable period, in
a business or other activity subject to City income tax, are deductible from
the taxpayer's net profits from similar business endeavors for the same period.
      (2)   Losses are deductible only in the taxable period in which they are
incurred.  There is no carry forward or backward of losses.

881.05   COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Duty of Withholding.
      (1)   Except as provided in the City Income Tax Ordinance or elsewhere in
these Rules and Regulations, each employer within or doing business within the
City who employs one or more individuals shall, without assessment or notice or
demand, deduct at the time of each payment, from the qualifying salary, wage,
commission or other compensation earned, allocated, received,  set aside or
paid residents of the City regardless of where the services were rendered, and
for nonresidents who performed work or services or other income producing
activities in the City, the amount of tax due at the rate as provided in the
Income Tax Ordinance.  Federal deferred income plans and tax sheltered annuity
plans, while they may not be applicable to federal withholding, are not
recognized for City purposes; the full amount of gross wages shall be withheld
upon for City income tax purposes.  Contributions by an employee from his or
her current earnings to any retirement or annuity plan or the like do not act
to reduce such employee's income for City tax or withholding purposes.
      (2)   All employers within or doing business within the City are required
to make the collections and deductions specified in this section from the gross
income of all City residents regardless of the fact that all or part of the
services performed by such residents of City may be performed outside the City.
      (3)   The place where payroll is prepared, even though it may be outside
the City, has no bearing on the duty of an employer to deduct and remit the
proper City income tax.
      (4)   Employers who do not maintain a permanent office or place of
business in the City, but who are subject to tax on net profits attributable to
the City, are considered to be employers within the City and subject to City
withholding requirements.
      (5)   Commissions and fees paid to independent contractors are not
subject to withholding or collection of the tax at the source.  Taxpayers
receiving such commissions and fees, in all instances, must file a declaration
and return and must pay the tax per the Income Tax Ordinance.  It is the
responsibility of any entity or individual to provide copies to the City of
Federal Form 1099 or such other form used to report commissions, fees or other
compensation paid to non-employees.  Such Forms 1099 or other reporting forms
shall be due on or before February 28 of each year and shall include a
calculation of the total compensation earned in the City by all recipients of
said compensation during the preceding year.
      (6)   Where a nonresident receives compensation for personal services
rendered or performed partly inside and partly outside the City, the employer
shall, without assessment or notice or demand, withhold and remit the tax on
that portion of the compensation which is earned within the City.  The employer
shall comply with the following rules of apportionment when making a
determination as to amount to withhold:
         A.   If the nonresident is a salesperson, agent or other employee
whose compensation depends directly on the volume of business transacted or
chiefly effected by the employee, the deducting and withholding shall attach to
the portion of the entire compensation which the volume of business transacted
or chiefly effected by the employee bears to the total volume of business
conducted by said employee.
         B.   The deducting and withholding from the compensation of other
nonresident employees, including officers of corporations, shall attach to the
proportion of the compensation of such employee which the total number of
working hours within the City is of the total working hours.
         C.   The fact that nonresident employees are subject to call at any
time does not permit the allocation of pay for the time worked within the City
on a seven-day per week basis.  The percentage of time worked in the City will
be calculated on the basis of a 40-hour week unless the employer notifies and
documents with the Superintendent that a greater or lesser number of hours is
worked.  The determination of tax liability of nonresidents working in and out
of the City is to be computed on the formula of the total number of days worked
in the City divided by the total number of days worked during the year and the
resulting percentage applied to the total annual income from wages including
sick leave, vacation, wage continuation plans and the like.  A working day is
any day for which compensation is received whether or not services were
performed that day.  Where no record can be substantiated of the number of days
worked during the year, the figure 260 is to be used as the total number of
days worked.
         D.   Wage continuation plans paid by the employer or third party agent
on behalf of the employer for the purpose of health, rest, recuperation or
other reward are deemed to have the same tax situs as the primary job
assignment or job location of the employee and are taxable on the same ratio as
the normal earnings of such employee.
         E.   An employee's attendance of meetings, training sessions, seminars
and the like do not constitute changes in tax situs and are not factors in
determining time in or out of the City.
         F.   The occasional entry into the City by a nonresident employee who
performs the duties for which he or she is employed primarily outside the City
but who enters the City for less than 12 days during any calendar year, shall
not be deemed to take such employee out of the class of those rendering their
services entirely outside the City.  For the purposes of the 12-day
calculation, "day" means any part of a 24-hour calendar day. 
         G.   The Superintendent of Taxation shall, upon review of all
circumstances, make a determination as to the taxable status of the employee
and the duty of the employer to withhold the tax.
      (7)   Where an employee is given advances against future wages,
commissions or other compensation, withholding shall be on the full amount
advanced.
      (8)   Bonuses paid to employees as well as prizes and gifts to employees
from their employers are subject to the City income tax and the employer shall
withhold the tax at the time of payment.  Such tax shall be remitted in the
return for that period in the same manner as for any other compensation.
      (9)   Employers shall withhold and remit the tax on the full amount of
qualifying wages, salaries, commissions and other compensation paid to
employees regardless of the fact that an employee may have allowable expenses
in connection with such compensation.  Such expenses may, when certain criteria
is met and if properly substantiated, be allowed as a reduction of the
employee's taxable income at the time the employee files his or her annual City
income tax return.
      (10)   Contributions by an employee from his or her earnings to any
retirement or annuity plan or the like, do not act to reduce such employee's
income for City income tax purposes, even though such contributions may be
treated as a tax deferment for federal income tax purposes.  For City purposes,
the employer shall withhold on the full amount of qualifying wages, salaries,
commissions and other compensation.
      (11)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages or
other compensation paid to domestic servants employed exclusively in or about
such person's residence.  However, such employee shall be subject to all other
aspects of the Income Tax Ordinance and these Rules and Regulations.
      (12)   A City employer required to withhold the tax from a City resident
for work done or services performed in another municipality shall be relieved
from the requirement of withholding the City tax from such City resident except
where the rate of tax of the other municipality is less than the rate imposed
by the City Income Tax Ordinance.  In such case, the employer shall withhold
and remit to the City the difference between the amount due to the other
municipality and the amount that would otherwise be due to the City.
      (13)   The mere fact that the tax is not withheld will not relieve the
employee of the responsibility of filing a return and paying the proper amount
of tax due.
      (14)   The officer or employee having control or supervision of or
charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making payment is
personally liable for failure to file the City return or pay the City tax due
as required.  The officer or employee shall be personally liable for the tax he
or she failed to return or pay as well as any related interest, penalties or
fees.  The dissolution of a corporation does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of the corporation to file City
returns or pay City tax due.
   (b)   Return and Payment of Tax Withheld and Status of Employers.
      (1)   Every employer required to withhold City income tax from the
salaries, wages and other compensation shall, on of before the last day of each
month, make a return and pay the tax withheld during the preceding calendar
month.  However, the Superintendent of Taxation shall have the authority to
approve the filing of returns and payment of the tax on a quarterly basis when
deemed to be in the best interest of the City.
         A.   An employer who wishes to file and remit quarterly may request
the authority for quarterly filing from the Superintendent.  Such request must
be in writing, stating the name and City withholding account number of the
employer, the address to which withholding forms should be mailed, the
estimated amount of tax to be withheld each quarter, and the name, title and
address of the person or persons responsible for complying with City
withholding requirements.  In considering such a request, the Superintendent
will base the decision on the facts and the best interests of the City.  The
best interest of the City will be the primary deciding factor.  Once approval
is granted for quarterly filing and payment, the employer may continue on such
basis unless notified by the Superintendent that quarterly filing is
withdrawn.  The Superintendent shall withdraw the quarterly filing
authorization whenever it is deemed that such quarterly authorization is no
longer in the City's best interest.
         B.   Notice of withdrawal of quarterly filing authorization shall be
made in writing and may be served in person or mailed to the address where
withholding returns are mailed.  Proof of mailing furnished by the United
States Post Office shall be presumptive proof of receipt.
         C.   Employers authorized to file and pay on a quarterly basis shall,
on or before the last day of each month following the calendar quarter ending
March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, make a return and pay the tax
withheld during the preceding calendar quarter.
      (2)   Every employer is deemed to be a trustee for the City in collecting
and holding the tax required per the Income Tax Ordinance to be withheld and
all funds so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds.
      (3)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold the City income tax
at the source is liable directly to the City for payment of such tax whether
the tax was actually collected or withheld from the employee or not.
      (4)   Every employer required to withhold City income tax shall file, no
later than February 28 of each year, an annual reconciliation covering the
aggregate amount deducted and remitted during the entire preceding calendar
year.  The employer shall file with the Superintendent, in a form prescribed by
the Superintendent, an information return for each employee from whom the City
income tax has been withheld, clearly showing the name, address and social
security number of the employee, the total amount of compensation paid during
the year and the amount of City income tax withheld from such employee.  The
information return may be a copy of Federal Form W-2 or other listing as
approved by the Superintendent and containing the required information.
      (5)   If more than the amount of tax required to be deducted by the
employer is withheld from the employee's pay, such excess may be refunded by
the employer or the City depending upon the circumstances and the time the
over-withholding is determined, as follows:
         A.   Current employees:
            1.   If the over-withholding is discovered in the same withholding
period, the employer shall make the necessary adjustment directly with the
employee and the amount to be reported as withheld shall be the corrected
amount.
            2.   If the over-withholding is discovered in a subsequent period
of the same calendar year, the employer may make proper adjustment with the
employee.  In such case, the report for the period in which the adjustment is
made shall indicate the total amount actually withheld, the amount of the
adjustment deducted therefrom, and the corrected amount reported.
            3.   If the over-withholding is discovered in the following year,
the employer should notify the Superintendent of such over-withholding and the
circumstances thereof.  Upon proper verification, the Superintendent shall
refund to the employee the amount of such excess withholding.
         B.   Former employees:
            1.   If over-withholding is discovered from an employee who is no
longer employed by the employer, the employer shall notify the Superintendent
and provide verification of the amount and circumstances of such over-
withholding and the Superintendent shall then refund to the employee the amount
of such excess withholding.
            2.   If the error is discovered by the employee, such employee
shall file a claim with the Superintendent and, upon certification by the
employer, the Superintendent shall refund to the employee the amount of such
excess withholding.
      (6)   Where an employer has withheld the tax from all wages of a
nonresident of the City and such nonresident has been employed outside the City
for all or a part of the time, such employee shall file a claim with the
Superintendent covering such withholding and the Superintendent shall, upon
verification by the employer, refund to the employee the amount of any excess
withholding.
      (7)   If less than the amount of tax required to be deducted is withheld
from an employee, such deficiency shall be withheld from subsequent wages.  If
the employee- employer relationship has terminated, the employer shall,
immediately upon discovery, notify the Superintendent of such deficiency and
the reasons and circumstances involved.
      (8)   In deducting and withholding the tax at the source and payment of
any tax due, a fractional part of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts
to one-half cent ($.005) or more, in which case, it shall be increased to one
cent ($.01).  No person shall be entitled to a refund nor additional payment
merely because such rounding of the tax resulted in an apparent over or under
payment.
      (9)   Employers desiring to make withholding filings and remittances by
electronic funds transfer may do so beginning in 2003.  Effective January 1,
2004, such electronic funds transfer shall be mandatory for those employers
required to make remittances on a monthly basis and by those employers who use
a payroll service, an outside contractor or other third-party service or entity
to process their withholding.  Effective January 1, 2008, it shall become
mandatory for all employers required to withhold and remit the tax to make such
filings and remittances by electronic funds transfer.  Electronic funds
transfers must be made in a format that is compatible with  systems in use by
the City and such format must be approved by the Tax Superintendent.
(Ord. 67-28.  Passed 12-4-67; Res. 90-R-29.  Passed 10-1-90; Ord. 02-24. 
Passed 12-23-02.)
881.06   DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Requirement of Filing.
      (1)   A declaration of estimated tax shall be filed by every taxpayer who
may reasonably be expected to have income that is taxable to the City, the tax
on which is not or will not be fully withheld upon by an employer or employers
for City tax purposes.
      (2)   A taxpayer's final return for the preceding year may be used as the
basis for calculating the declaration of estimated tax for the current year. 
In any event, declarations must present a good faith estimate of the tax that
can reasonably be anticipated to be due. 
      (3)   The Superintendent of Taxation may file a declaration or amended
declaration of estimated tax on the behalf of a taxpayer when such declaration
has not been received by the City or when such declaration, in the judgment of
the Superintendent, is considered not to have been filed accurately and in good
faith.
      (4)   If, upon the filing of the final return, the taxpayer did not pay
at least 90% of the tax liability as properly shown on said return, the
difference between 90% of the liability and the amount of estimated tax
actually paid on or before January 31 of the following year or the thirteenth
month after the beginning of a fiscal year, shall be subject to interest and
penalty assessments as provided in the Income Tax Ordinance and these Rules and
Regulations.
         A.   Any taxpayer whose declared taxes and payments are equal to or
greater than the tax paid in the previous tax year shall not be assessed any
interest or penalty for any increased taxes found to be due in the current
year, except in the case where the required return and final return payment
have not been submitted within the three and one-half month period after the
close of the tax year.
         B.   An individual taxpayer who resides in the City and who is subject
to penalty and interest assessment due to the underpayment of estimated tax
shall not be assessed such penalty and interest if said taxpayer was not
domiciled in the City on the first day of January of the calendar year for
which the assessment was applicable.
   (b)   Date of Filing.
      (1)   Declarations are to be filed each year by April 15 or, for those
taxpayers having a fiscal year or tax period differing from a calendar year,
within three and one-half calendar months after the beginning of such tax
period.
      (2)   A person or other entity conducting a business not previously
subject to the tax, or who has income not fully withheld upon, shall file a
declaration within three and one-half months after first becoming subject to
the tax.
   (c)   Amended Declarations.  An amended declaration must be filed on or
before January 31 of the following year, or in the case of a taxpayer on a
fiscal year basis, on or before the last day of the thirteenth month following
the beginning of such fiscal year, if it appears that the original declaration
made for such taxable year underestimated the taxpayer's income by 10% or
more.  At such time, a payment which, together with prior payments, is
sufficient to pay the taxpayer's entire estimated liability shall be made.
   (d)   Form of Filing.
      (1)   Declarations shall be filed on a form furnished by or obtainable
from the City Income Tax Division or other form as approved by the
Superintendent of Taxation.  Credit shall be taken for City tax to be withheld
from any portion of the income.  Additionally, credit may be taken for tax
properly due and paid or properly withheld and remitted to another taxing
municipality or joint economic development district.
      (2)   The original estimate of tax liability or any subsequent amended
estimate may be increased or decreased by filing an amended declaration on or
before any quarterly payment date.  Such amendment may be made on the regular
declaration remittance form.
   (e)   Dates of Payments.
      (1)   The estimated tax of an individual taxpayer may be paid in full
with the declaration or in equal installments on or before the last day of the
fourth, seventh, tenth and thirteenth month after the beginning of the taxable
year.
      (2)   The estimated tax of a business taxpayer may he paid in full with
the declaration or in equal installments on or before the fifteenth day of the
fourth, sixth, ninth and twelfth month after the beginning of the taxable year.
      (3)   In the event that an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments over the
remaining payment dates.
   (f)   Final Returns Required.  The filing of a declaration does not relieve
the taxpayer of the duty and necessity of filing a final annual City income tax
return even though there may be no difference between the estimated tax
liability and the actual tax liability and payment has been made in full.
(Ord. 67-28.  Passed 12-4-67; Res. 90-R-29.  Passed 10-1-90; Ord. 02-24. 
Passed 12-23-02.)
881.07   DUTIES AND POWERS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF TAXATION.
   (a)   General Provisions.
      (1)   It shall be the duty of the Income Tax Superintendent to administer
the Income Tax Ordinance of the City, to receive the tax imposed by the Income
Tax Ordinance in the manner prescribed by the Income Tax Ordinance and to keep
an accurate record thereof.  The Superintendent shall report all monies
received, on a daily basis, to the Director of Finance.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of the Superintendent to enforce payment of
all taxes owing the City, to keep accurate records for a minimum of five years
showing the amount due from each taxpayer and to show the dates and amounts of
payments thereof.
      (3)   The Superintendent is charged with the responsibility to enforce
the provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance and is empowered to adopt rules,
policies, and procedures relating to any matter pertaining to the
administration and enforcement of the Income Tax Ordinance. 
         A.   Any taxpayer, employer or other interested party desiring a
special ruling on any matter pertaining to the Income Tax Ordinance or these
Rules and Regulations should submit to the Superintendent, in writing, all
facts involved and the ruling sought. 
         B.   Certain rules, policies, procedures and the like, as established
by the Superintendent per the above empowerment may additionally require
concurrence by the City Council or Income Tax Board of Appeals.
      (4)   The Superintendent has the authority to correct or adjust any
return submitted when a correction or adjustment is necessary to accomplish the
intent of the Income Tax Ordinance or these Rules and Regulations. 
         A.   If, as a result of investigation and examination by the
Superintendent, a return is found to be incorrect, the Superintendent is
authorized to assess and collect any underpayment of tax withheld at the source
or any underpayment of tax due from any taxpayer on earnings or net profits or
both.
         B.   If, as a result of such investigation or examination it is found
that an overpayment has been made, the Superintendent shall allow such
overpayment as a credit against a subsequent year liability or refund that
amount to the taxpayer.
      (5)   In the event that the Superintendent has obtained information
indicating that a taxpayer may have an obligation to file a return or may have
a tax obligation that was not shown on a return, the Superintendent is
authorized to assess and collect the tax actually due with or without the
formality of obtaining a return from the employer or taxpayer.
         A.   The Superintendent may prepare returns on behalf of an employer
or taxpayer.
         B.   Whenever the Superintendent has been unable to secure information
from a taxpayer or employer as to the taxable income for any year, the
Superintendent may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due, together
with any penalties, interest or fees, and assess the taxpayer or employer upon
the basis of such determination.  Such determination may be adjusted upon
submission by the taxpayer of actual records from which the correct amount of
tax due may be calculated.
      (6)   The Superintendent shall make electronic versions of the Income Tax
Ordinance, these Rule and Regulations and Vandalia income tax returns available
to the public through the Internet.  Any amendments, supplements or changes to
the Income Tax Ordinance or Rules and Regulations shall be made available on
the Internet within 90 days of adoption of such amendment, supplement or
change.
   (b)   Corrections and Assessments.
      (1)   Where a taxpayer or employer has failed to file a return or has
filed a return which is incomplete or does not show the proper amount of tax
due, the Superintendent may assess and collect any underpayment of tax withheld
at the source or any underpayment of tax due from any taxpayer on earnings or
net profits or both.  In such case, the Superintendent shall issue a proposed
assessment showing the amount of tax due together with any penalties, interest
or fees that may be applicable.
         A.   Such proposed assessment shall be served in person or by mailing
to the taxpayer's last known address.  Proof of mailing furnished by the U.S.
Post Office shall be presumptive proof of receipt by the addressee.  A proposed
assessment is not necessary in cases where a taxpayer or employer has filed a
return indicating the amount of tax due but has failed to pay the tax shown to
be due.  In such instances, the Superintendent may proceed with enforcement
provisions per the Income Tax Ordinance.
         B.   A taxpayer may, within 30 days after the date the proposed
assessment was served or mailed, file a written appeal with the
Superintendent.  If no appeal is filed with 30 days, such proposed assessment
shall become final.  If the Superintendent receives such appeal, the taxpayer
will be given an opportunity, within 30 days of receipt of such appeal, to a
hearing with the Superintendent to discuss the proposed assessment and to
present any facts relative to the assessment.  The Superintendent may extend
the date of the hearing upon good cause shown.  After such hearing, the
Superintendent shall withdraw, modify or reaffirm the assessment and it shall
then become final.
      (2)   When a proposed assessment becomes final, notice of such final
assessment shall be issued by the Superintendent and shall be served in the
same manner as a proposed assessment.
         A.   A taxpayer shall have 30 days after the date a final assessment
is served or mailed to file a written appeal with the Board of Tax Appeals. 
Such written notice of appeal shall be filed in a sealed envelope plainly
marked "Appeal to Board of Tax Appeals" and mailed or delivered to the
Superintendent, who shall, within five days after receipt, deliver such appeal
to the Chairperson of the Board of Tax Appeals or, if the Chairperson is not
available, to the Vice- Chairperson.
         B.   Within 30 days of notification from the Board of Tax Appeals that
an appeal has been filed, the Superintendent shall provide the Board with a
certified transcript of all actions, and the reasoning behind those actions,
that were taken on the account prior to the final assessment being made.  Such
transcript shall be open to review by the taxpayer and the taxpayer's counsel.
      (3)   When the Board of Appeals grants a hearing on a final assessment,
both the Superintendent and the taxpayer may present evidence relating to such
assessment.  The Board of Appeals may affirm, reverse or modify the final
assessment and shall furnish a copy of the decision to the Superintendent and
to the taxpayer.  The taxpayer's copy of the decision shall be served in the
same manner as the proposed and final assessments.
   (c)   Installment Plans.  The Superintendent is authorized to arrange for
payment of unpaid taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment
payments when the taxpayer has shown that due to certain hardship conditions a
timely full payment of the amount due cannot be made. 
      (1)   Such authorization for an installment plan shall not be granted
until all proper and complete returns are filed and all amounts owed are
established and all other payment options have, in the judgment of the
Superintendent, been fully explored and eliminated.
      (2)   Installment plans shall not exceed a period of six months unless,
in the judgment of the Superintendent, and with exceptional hardship conditions
proven by the taxpayer, it is in the best interest of the City to grant
provisions for an extended payment plan.
      (3)   When a delinquent balance due encompasses more than one tax year,
any payments received shall first be applied to the oldest year tax balance due
until the tax for that year is paid in full before applying payments to any
other year or to penalties, interest or fees.
      (4)   Failure to make any installment plan payment when due shall cause
the total unpaid amount, including all penalties, interest and fees, to become
due and payable on demand and to become subject to all enforcement provisions
of the Income Tax Ordinance.
   (d)   Investigative Authority.
      (1)   The Income Tax Superintendent or any designated employee of the
Income Tax Office is authorized to examine the books, papers, records and other
documents, including Federal, State and other city income tax returns, of any
employer or taxpayer or person or entity subject to the City income tax, or
whom the Superintendent believes is subject to the tax, for the purpose of
verifying the accuracy of any return made, or if no return was made, to
ascertain the tax due under the provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance.  Every
such employer, supposed employer, taxpayer, supposed taxpayer, person or entity
is required, within ten days following the written request from the
Superintendent, to furnish to the Superintendent or duly authorized employee,
the means, facilities and opportunity for making inspections and investigations
of books, papers, records and other documents that may relate, in the judgment
of the Superintendent, to City income tax.
      (2)   The Superintendent, or any person empowered to act in the
Superintendent's capacity, is authorized to examine any person reasonably
believed to have knowledge of the facts to appear before the Superintendent and
to examine such person, under oath, concerning any income or profit which was,
or should have been, returned for taxation, or any transaction tending to
affect such income.
         A.   The Superintendent may issue subpoenas, if necessary, for
attendance, whether the examination is to be at the income tax office or at the
office of the taxpayer or other designated location, of all persons whether as
parties or witnesses, whenever it is believed that such persons may have
knowledge of such income or profits or other pertinent information or
transaction that may affect income or profit.  Individuals may be so ordered
whether or not such individuals have custody of actual books and records of the
taxpayer or employer or entity being investigated.
         B.   The Superintendent is specifically authorized to order the
appearance of the local manager or representative of any taxpayer or employer
or entity.
      (3)   Persons required to attend any hearings shall be notified not less
than ten days prior to the time of the hearing.  The notice shall show the time
and place of the hearing and what books, papers, records or other documents or
information is to be made available.
      (4)   The notice or subpoena shall be served by the Superintendent, or
duly authorized agent, by delivering it to the person named in the notice, or
by leaving the notice at the person's usual residence or place of business, or
by mailing it to such usual residence or place of business by certified mail,
return receipt requested.
      (5)   Refusal by any taxpayer, employer or other person or entity subject
to or presumed to be subject to the tax, or having knowledge of or presumed to
have knowledge of pertinent tax information, to appear before the
Superintendent or to produce books, papers, records and other documents, as
ordered by the Superintendent shall be deemed to be in violation of the Income
Tax Ordinance.  Such refusal by any taxpayer or employer or entity or other
person to appear, or to produce books, papers, records or other documents or
information as ordered by the Superintendent, constitutes a misdemeanor
punishable by fine or imprisonment or both, as prescribed by the Income Tax
Ordinance.
      (6)   Every taxpayer and employer subject to the tax is required to keep
such records as will enable the filing of true, complete and accurate City
income tax returns whether of taxes payable upon earnings or net profits or
both or of taxes withheld at the source.  Such records are to be maintained and
preserved for a period of not less than five years after the close of the
calendar or fiscal year to which the records relate or five years after the
date the final return is filed and paid or the withholding taxes are remitted,
whichever is later.
   (e)   Confidentiality.  Any information gained as a result of any returns,
investigations, verifications or hearings before the Superintendent as required
or authorized by the Income Tax Ordinance, shall be confidential and no
disclosure thereof shall be made except for official purposes or as ordered by
a court of competent jurisdiction.
      (1)   The Superintendent may furnish copies of returns filed and other
required information to examiners of the State of Ohio in connection with their
duties of auditing political subdivisions.
      (2)   Nothing in these Rules and Regulations shall be construed as giving
authority to any elected or administrative official or employee of the City,
other than those of the Income Tax Division, for access to tax returns or other
information in connection therewith that is filed with the Income Tax Division.
      (3)   Dissemination of information by the Superintendent of a general
statistical nature, including but not limited to reports of total amounts
collected, number of returns filed and the like, is not prohibited.
(Ord. 67-28.  Passed 12-4-67; Ord. 02-24.  Passed 12-23-02.)
881.08   INTEREST, PENALTIES AND FEES.
   (a)   Interest.  All taxes due from taxpayers and moneys withheld by
employers, or required to be withheld by employers, and remaining unpaid,
including estimated tax payments ultimately found to be due, shall bear
interest, in addition to the unpaid tax or withholdings, at the rate of one and
one-half percent per month, or any part thereof, until paid in full.  Interest
will be assessed on any tax not paid by the due date.  Having an approved
extension will not preclude the assessment of interest on any taxes paid late. 
Extensions, when requested and approved, extend only the time to file, not the
time to pay any taxes due.
   (b)   Late Payment Penalties.
      (1)   In addition to any interest assessments, penalties based on the
unpaid tax are imposed as follows:
         A.   For failure of a business or individual to pay taxes when due,
other than taxes withheld, a penalty of one-half of one percent per month or
fraction thereof, or 10%, whichever is greater.
         B.   For failure to remit taxes withheld from employees, a penalty of
3% per month or fraction thereof, or 10%, whichever is greater.
         C.   On the excess of 90% of the actual tax over the amount paid on
declaration of estimated tax where a declaration has not been filed estimating
a tax liability in the same or greater amount than paid the previous year, or
where a final return has not been filed and the total paid on or before the end
of the month following the close of the taxable year, a penalty of 10% of the
difference between 90% of the total tax for the year and the amount paid
through withholdings or declarations is imposed.
         D.   Except in the case of fraud, the penalty shall not exceed 50% of
the unpaid tax.
      (2)   In the case where an extension of time to file has been authorized
by the Superintendent, penalty will be assessed from the date the return was
due when the return is not filed within the authorized extended period.
   (c)   Late Filing Fees.  In addition to any interest or penalties based on
late or non-payment of taxes, a late filing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00)
shall be assessed for late or non-filing of complete returns by the due date. 
Such late filing fees shall be assessed whenever a complete return is not filed
by the due date without regard to amounts of tax due.  The fact that such
delinquent tax returns may have no tax due shall not relieve the taxpayer or
employer of the responsibility to file the return in a timely manner or cause
an abatement or adjustment of late filing fees.
   (d)   Exceptions.
      (1)   Late payment penalties will not be assessed when an audit or
correction of a return by the Income Tax Division staff results in additional
tax due, if the return was originally and in good faith, timely filed and taxes
due thereon timely paid and the additional taxes resulting from the audit or
correction paid in full within 15 days of notification of the additional amount
due.  In the absence of fraud, there will be no assessment of a penalty or
interest on any additional taxes due resulting from a Federal audit provided an
amended City return is filed and the additional taxes due are paid in full
within three months after the final determination of the federal tax liability.
      (2)   Late filing fees shall not be assessed in instances where a
taxpayer has properly requested and been granted by the Tax Superintendent an
extension of time to file and subsequently files a complete return by the
extended due date.
         A.   Any taxes not paid by the original due date shall bear interest
and penalty without regard for the extended due date.
         B.   Having an extension for Federal purposes shall have no bearing on
City tax requirements and shall not cause an abatement of a penalty unless the
proper extension of time to file the City return has been requested of and
granted by the Superintendent.
      (3)   Late filing fees may be waived when an individual taxpayer is
filing a City return for the first time due to being a new resident or becoming
18 years of age during that tax year. 
         A.   Such waivers apply to individual taxpayers only and are not
applicable to employers required to file withholding returns or to businesses
required to file on net profits.
         B.   Late filing fee waivers will not be granted if the individual
taxpayer has not complied with the filing requirements of the Income Tax
Ordinance within six months after first being notified by the Superintendent of
such requirement.
      (4)   Late filing fees will not be assessed when a nonresident is filing
a return only for the purpose of obtaining a refund.
      (5)   Upon recommendation of the Superintendent, the Board of
Adjudication may abate or adjust or compromise late payment penalties or
interest or late filing fees when the taxpayer has shown good cause for the
late filing or late payment of taxes when due.  Upon appeal, the Board of
Adjudication may, without recommendation of the Superintendent, abate or adjust
or compromise late payment penalties, interest or late filing fees when it is
deemed to be in the City's best interest to do so.
      (6)   Penalty and interest charges shall not be levied when the total of
such charges amounts to less than five dollars ($5.00).
   (e)   Violations by Employers.  Any person required to withhold the tax who
knowingly fails to withhold such tax, or pay over such tax or knowingly
attempts in any manner to evade or defeat such tax or the payment thereof,
shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty
equal to the total amount of the tax evaded or not withheld, or not paid over.
(Ord. 67-28.  Passed 12-4-67; Ord. 86-11.  Passed 11-3-86; Res. 90-R-29. 
Passed 10-1-90; Ord. 02-24.  Passed 12-23-02.)
881.09   COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUND OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   Unpaid Sums a Civil Debt.
      (1)   All taxes imposed by the Income Tax Ordinance and not paid when due
become, together with interest, penalties and fees thereon, a debt due the City
from the taxpayer and are recoverable by civil suit.  Employers who are
obligated to withhold and remit taxes required to be withheld at the source,
and who fail to meet such withholding and remittance requirements, become
liable to the City in a civil suit to enforce payment of the debt created by
such failure.
      (2)   Except in those cases in which specific statute of limitation
rights have been waived under the Ohio Revised Code, or cases in which a waiver
of Federal statute of limitations has been executed, an additional tax
assessment shall not be made by the Superintendent after three years from the
time the complete return was due or filed, whichever is later, except in the
case of filing a false or fraudulent return to evade payment of the tax,
omission of 25% or more of income subject to the tax, or failure to file a
return.  In those cases where the Internal Revenue Service and the taxpayer
have executed a waiver of the Federal statute of limitations, the period within
which an assessment may be made by the Superintendent is extended to one year
from the time of final determination of Federal tax liability.
   (b)   Refunds and Overpayments.
      (1)   Taxes that are overpaid shall not be refunded unless a claim for
refund is made within three years from the date on which such payment was made,
or the return was due, whichever is later.
      (2)   No refund shall be made when a taxpayer is not in full compliance
with all provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance or these Rules and Regulations
or when the taxpayer has not furnished all information and documentation
required by the Income Tax Ordinance or the Superintendent.
      (3)   Overpayments will be either refunded or credited to the taxpayer's
current year liability at the taxpayer's option.  When no such option has been
indicated by the taxpayer, any overpayment will be credited to the current year
estimated tax due.  All overpayments will be transferred first to any tax year
in which there is a delinquent balance due before such overpayment will be
credited to any estimated taxes or refunded.
      (4)   All refund claims for tax that was withheld by an employer shall be
conditioned upon the employer providing certification that such withholding was
true and correct and that the employer's withholding account with the City has
not been adjusted and such employer's City withholding account has been
reconciled.
      (5)   Overpayments of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall not be refunded
nor credited to any subsequent tax year.
(Ord. 67-28.  Passed 12-4-67; Res. 90-R-29.  Passed 10-1-90; Ord. 02-24. 
Passed 12-23-02.)
881.10   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY; CREDIT TO RESIDENTS.
   Every individual taxpayer who resides within the City but who earns,
receives, accrues or in any other way has set aside to him any net profits,
wages, salaries, commissions or other compensation for work done or services
performed within another municipality, within a joint economic development
district or within a joint economic development zone and who can establish and
document that the tax was properly paid to the other municipality, joint
economic development district or joint economic development zone on such
earnings, may claim a credit of such tax against their City income tax
obligation.
   (a)   The credit may not exceed the amount of tax imposed by the City Income
Tax Ordinance; nor shall credit be allowed for the tax paid to another city on
any income of an amount higher than the City taxable income.
   (b)   The credit shall not be applicable to any tax year other than the tax
year when the tax upon which the credit is based was paid to the other
municipality, joint economic development district or joint economic development
zone.  There shall be no carry forward or backward of any such tax credit.
   (c)   No credit shall be given unless the taxpayer claims such credit on the
final return and presents such evidence and documentation as the Superintendent
may require of the properly due payment made to the other municipality, joint
economic development district or joint economic development zone.  A statement
satisfactory to the Superintendent from the other taxing municipality or joint
economic development district or joint economic development zone to which the
taxes for which credit is claimed are paid, that a City resident or that an
employer of a City resident has paid the tax, shall be considered as fulfilling
the evidence and documentation of taxes paid as required in this section.
   (d)   There shall be no credit allowed for any tax paid that is not based on
or measured by income.
   (e)   There shall be no credit allowed for any type of income tax paid to
the Federal Internal Revenue Service, the State of Ohio or any other State,
County, school district or any other taxing entity other than municipalities or
Ohio joint economic development zones or joint economic development districts
as created under Ohio R.C. 715.70 and 715.71.
      (1)   No credit will be allowed for taxes paid to joint economic
development zones or to joint economic development districts outside the State
of Ohio.
      (2)   In determining the amount of credit for taxes paid to cities
outside Ohio, the taxable income on which such credit is based must be
calculated in the same manner as for municipal taxes within Ohio.
   (f)   Where a resident of the City is subject to the tax of a municipality,
or joint economic development district or joint economic development zone, and
such tax is on or measured by income, the taxpayer shall not pay a total joint
economic development zone, joint economic development district or municipal tax
on the same income greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate.
   (g)   A non-refundable credit will be allowed in such case where a resident
of the City has paid municipal income tax to another City in error and the City
is pursuing the payment of tax due on the income that was paid incorrectly if
such tax is not refundable by the other city due to statute of limitations. 
Where collection efforts have begun by the City of Vandalia prior to the other
City tax becoming non-refundable due to statute of limitations and the taxpayer
has neglected or refused to obtain a refund from the other City, no credit
shall be allowed.
(Ord. 67-28.  Passed 12-4-67; Ord. 02-24.  Passed 12-23-02.)
881.11   VIOLATIONS.

commenced shall be extended to ten years from the date the return was due or
the date the false or fraudulent return was filed.
   (f)   The failure of any taxpayer, employer, person or other entity to
receive or procure a return, declaration or other form shall not excuse the
taxpayer, employer, person or other entity from making any return, information
return or declaration or from filing any such form or from paying the tax.
   (g)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of these Rules and Regulations,

882.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Director of Finance” is the Finance Director of the City.
   (b)   "Hotel" or "motel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained,
advertised or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered for a consideration to guests, in which five or more
rooms are used for the accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in
one or several structures.
   (c)   "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms or space or portion thereof, in any hotel or
motel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or
right to use or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office
space, banquet or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space
shall not be considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless
the person exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or
possess all or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging
or sleeping purposes.
   (d)   "Operator" means the person who is the proprietor of the hotel or
motel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, licensee, mortgagee in
possession, or any other capacity. Where the operator performed his or her
functions through a managing agent of any type or character, other than an
employee, the managing agent shall be deemed an operator for the purposes of
this chapter, and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her
principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the
principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance
by both.
   (e)   "Transient guest" means a person occupying a room for sleeping
accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (f)   "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in money,
whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits,

(Ord. 86-07.  Passed 5-19-86; Ord. 16-38.  Passed 12-19-16.)
882.02   IMPOSITION; RATE; PAYMENT.
   (a)   A three percent excise tax is hereby imposed, in accordance with law,
upon all rent for lodging furnished, or to be furnished, to transient guests in
the City. Such tax shall be paid on a monthly basis in conjunction with the
submission of a monthly reporting form, which form shall be provided to each
hotel and motel in the City by the City.
   (b)   Reporting and payment of such tax shall be in accordance with rules
and regulations promulgated by, and upon forms provided by, the Director of
Finance.
(Ord. 86-07.  Passed 5-19-86; Ord. 16-38.  Passed 12-19-16.)
882.03   EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   No tax shall be imposed under this chapter:
      (1)   Upon rents not within the taxing power of the City under the
constitution or laws of Ohio or the United States.
      (2)   Upon rents paid by the State of Ohio or any of its political
subdivisions.
   (b)   No exemption claimed under division (a) of this section shall be
granted, except upon a claim therefore made at the time rent is collected and
under penalty or perjury upon a form prescribed by the Director of Finance. All
claims of exemption shall be made in the manner prescribed by the Director of
Finance.
(Ord. 16-38.  Passed 12-19-16.)
882.04   RECORDS, INSPECTIONS, DESTRUCTION.
   Each operator shall keep complete and accurate records of all lodging
furnished and of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount due under
this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent documents. 
If the operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the operator's
records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale was not
exempted by reason of such identity, or shall show the nature of the
transaction if exempted for any other reason.  Such records and other documents
shall be open during business hours for inspection by the Director of Finance
or his or her agents and shall be preserved for a period of four years, unless
the Director of Finance, in writing, consents to their destruction within that
period, or unless the four-year period is extended by an order requesting that
such records be kept for a longer period of time.
(Ord. 16-38.  Passed 12-19-16.)
882.05   LIABILITY.
   (a)   The operator or authorized agent having control of or charged with the
responsibility of making and filing the return and making payment is personally
liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax due as required by this
chapter.
   (b)   If any operator corporation required to file returns and to remit tax
due to the City under the provisions of this chapter, fails for any reason to
make such filing or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments, shall be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due
for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this chapter or as otherwise permitted by law.
   (c)   If any operator fails to collect the tax or any transient guest fails
to pay the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter on any transaction
subject to the tax, such operator or transient guest shall be personally liable
for the amount of the tax applicable to the transaction. The Finance Director
may make an assessment against either the operator or transient guest, as the
facts may require, based upon any information in his or her possession.
   (d)   An assessment against a operator in cases where the tax imposed by or
pursuant to this chapter have not been collected or paid, shall not discharge
the transient guest's liability to reimburse the operator for the tax
applicable to such transaction.
   (e)   In each case, the Finance Director shall give to the operator or
transient guest assessed written notice of such assessment. Such notice may be
served upon the operator or transient guest assessed personally or by
registered or certified mail. An assessment issued against either, pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter shall not be considered an election of remedies,
nor a bar to an assessment against the other for the tax applicable to the same

      (1)   "Domicile" means the true, fixed and permanent home of the taxpayer
to which whenever absent, the taxpayer intends to return.
      (2)   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Municipality for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the
Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if
the tax administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (a)(1) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
   (b)   For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be

884.051   COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (a)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
884.052 or division (d) or (f) of this section. An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (a)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (b)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         A.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)B. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         B.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of
taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf
of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars ($200.00). Payments under division (b)(1)B. of this section
shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the
last day of each month.
   (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
884.091.
   (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold Municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or Municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for Federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this State to which the employee is required to report

services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (b)(1)A. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(b)(2) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for
"municipal corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that
division.
   (b)   (1)   Subject to divisions (c), (e), (f), and (g) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold Municipal income tax on qualifying wages

corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
         A.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the

            2.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to perform
services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services at the
location for more than twenty days.
         C.   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
884.051.
         D.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional entertainer,
or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the performance of
services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         D.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (b)
(2)C. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         E.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (d)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (b)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold Municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
884.03.  To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
884.051.

884.053   COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
   (a)   The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino operator,
as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and Ohio R.C.

deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall

amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         A.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         B.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
               If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor
is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the Municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (d)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold Municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (e)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (e) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with Ohio R.C. 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding

the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or Social Security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of Municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (f)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
            If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty percent of the tax

telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Ohio
R.C. Chapter 5745.
   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and

property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the
         Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during

section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
884.19(a).
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
884.19(a).
      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed
         for, or on behalf of, the employer or that the employee's presence at
the location directly or indirectly benefits the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's Municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made and
services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be

real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal

income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
884.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4., by a municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add
the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal

computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least

consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
884.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the

the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in

all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated Municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
884.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this

member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.

through D. of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
884.091.

this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:

date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the

reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
municipal corporation under Section
884.091 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

884.08   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID
884.081   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (a)   Where a resident of the City is subject to a municipal income tax in
another municipality, as well as in the City of Vandalia, he or she shall not
pay a total Municipal income tax on the same income greater than the tax
imposed at the highest rate to which he or she is subject.
   (b)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the City who receives net
profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service compensation
for work done or services performed or rendered outside the City, and who is
liable and has paid to another municipality an income tax on the same income
taxable and taxed under this chapter, shall be allowed a credit against the tax
imposed by this chapter (on the same income to the extent such income is taxed
under this chapter) of the amount so paid by him or on his behalf to such other
municipality. The credit shall not exceed the Vandalia tax assessed by this
chapter on such income earned in such other municipality or municipalities,
where such tax is paid. No credit shall be given for county or school district
taxes paid, but only for other municipal taxes paid.
   (c)   The amount of income reported on Federal Schedules C, E, and F, earned
in and taxed by a given municipality (as a percentage of total income reported
on Federal Schedules C, E, and F, attributable to taxing and non-taxing
jurisdictions) shall be used to determine each municipality's contribution to
Vandalia net profits taxable income, prior to calculation of the resident City
credit for taxes paid to other cities on net profit income. The rate to be used
for calculation of this credit shall be the lesser of the resident City tax
rate or the appropriate rate at which such income was taxed by such other
municipality.
   (d)   If the total amount of credit granted under this chapter exceeds the
total amount of tax due to the City before application of all such credits,
then no refund shall be due or payable to the taxpayer.
(Ord. 15-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
884.082   REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid Municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any Municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 15-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
884.083   CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
884.081.
(Ord. 15-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
884.084   CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
884.096.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
884.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
884.096.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
884.081 regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 15-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
884.09   ANNUAL RETURN
884.091   RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal taxable income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under Section

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized

   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed

   (e)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's Social Security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each

other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund

      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a

method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The Department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
Municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other Municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08.  The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,

Administrator.
         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
884.092 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in Section
884.092, the provision in Section
884.092 prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (f)(3) and (f)(4) of
this section.
   (i)   (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other Municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
884.051 shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.  Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
884.052.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
               The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in Municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of Municipal
taxable income on an annual Municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of

884.093   USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (a)   Any taxpayer subject to Municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any Municipal

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (d)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

Municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (e)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its Municipal income tax.

884.094   EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a Municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the Municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic Federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Municipal

the taxpayer's Municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under division (G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08, a

amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
884.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section
884.19(a)(2) for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less,
no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth
in division (c)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
884.096.  Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this section, the request
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other Municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
884.18.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any Municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
884.10(a)(4).

examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice

records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's possession

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section

   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 15-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
884.18   LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality. Two members shall be
appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality, and may not be
employees, elected officials, or contractors with the Municipality at any time
during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official
of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but
may not be the Director of Finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax
Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The Board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the Board.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the
hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the Board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43.  For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22.  For this reason, such hearings
shall not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be
present during the hearing.
(Ord. 15-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
884.19   ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
884.18.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding,
or holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax
Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have
jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that
assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of Municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
884.096.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
884.18, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,
there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal
representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section
884.096, with interest on that amount as provided by division (d) of this
section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover Municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 15-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
884.20   ADOPTION OF RULES.

of apartments; rooms and other rental accommodations shall file with the Tax
Administrator a report showing the name, address and telephone number, if
available, of each such tenant who occupies an apartment, room or other rental
property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Within thirty days after a tenant vacates an apartment, room or other

   (c)   Any owner of the real estate property who fails to make a report of
tenants of the premises under his or her control as required in division (B) of
this section, shall be fined up to a maximum of one hundred dollars ($100.00)
per unreported tenant.
   (d)   Any information gained as a result of any returns, investigations,
hearings or verification required or authorized by the chapter shall be
confidential and no person shall disclose such information except in accordance
with proper judicial order or in connection with the performance of that
person's official duties or the official business of the municipal corporation
as authorized by the chapter.
(Ord. 15-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
884.22   INFORMATION BY CONTRACTORS.

CHAPTER.
   (a)   Effective with taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 a
taxpayer may elect to be subject to Ohio R.C. 718.80 to 718.95 in lieu of the
provisions set forth in this chapter. All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 718.01,
shall control in the interpretation of this section
884.23. For purposes of section
884.23 "Tax Administrator" does not include the Tax Commissioner and "Tax
Commissioner" means the Tax Commissioner appointed under Ohio R.C. 121.03.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon the taxpayer's
election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The Tax Commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of each
municipal income tax for which the taxpayer is liable for the term of the
election;
      (2)   The Commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to Ohio R.C.
718.80 to 718.95 and any applicable provision of Ohio R.C. Chapter 5703.
   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the Tax Commissioner and each municipal corporation in which the
taxpayer conducted business during the previous taxable year, on a form
prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
      (2)   A.   The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the Tax Commissioner and each municipal corporation
in which the taxpayer conducted business during the previous taxable year of
its termination of the election.
         B.   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form prescribed
by the Tax Commissioner, on or before the first day of the third month of any
taxable year.
         C.   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the taxpayer
is no longer subject to Ohio R.C. 718.80 to 718.95, and is instead subject to
the provisions set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (c)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Ohio R.C. 718.80 to 718.95
is confidential, and no person shall disclose such information, except for
official purposes, in accordance with a proper judicial order, or as provided
in Ohio R.C. 4123.271 or 5703.21. The Tax Commissioner may furnish the internal
revenue service with copies of returns filed. This section does not prohibit
the publication of statistics in a form which does not disclose information
with respect to particular taxpayers.
   (d)   For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual return.
Such return, along with the amount of tax shown to be due on the return less
the amount paid for the taxable year under Ohio R.C. 718.88, shall be submitted
to the Tax Commissioner, on a form and in the manner prescribed by the
Commissioner, on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year.
   (e)   All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under Ohio R.C.
718.80 shall file any tax return or extension for filing a tax return, and
shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such returns, electronically,
either through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by
the Tax Commissioner.
   (f)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Ohio R.C.
718.80 fails to pay any tax as required under Ohio R.C. 718.80 to 718.95, or
any portion of that tax, on or before the date prescribed for its payment,
interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in the same manner as the tax,
upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum prescribed by Ohio R.C. 5703.47
from the date prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an
assessment is issued under Ohio R.C. 718.90, whichever occurs first.
   (g)    (1)   A credit, granted by resolution or ordinance of a municipal
corporation pursuant to Ohio R.C. 718.15 or 718.151, shall be available to a
taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Ohio R.C. 718.80, against the
municipal corporation's tax on income.
      (2)   A.   Each taxpayer that claims a credit shall submit, with the
taxpayer's tax return, documentation issued by the municipal corporation
granting the credit that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the
credit, the amount of the credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the
tax year to which the credit is to be applied.
         B.   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by
the Tax Commissioner.
         C.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Tax
Commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by a municipal corporation and taxpayer under Ohio R.C. 718.15 or 718.151,
or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing agreement.
(Ord. 18-02. Passed 2-19-18)
884.97   COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (a)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the
aforesaid period are fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the
collection of taxes or for the punishment of violations of this chapter have
been fully terminated, subject to the limitations contained in Section
884.19.
   (b)   Annual returns due for all or any part of the last effective year of
this chapter shall be due on the date provided in Section
884.091 as though the same were continuing.
(Ord. 15-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
884.98   SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter. This chapter and each
section and provision of this chapter, are hereby declared to be independent
sections and subsections and, notwithstanding any other evidence of legislative
intent, the Council of the Municipality, by adoption of the legislation
containing this section, hereby states that it is the controlling legislative
intent that if any provisions of said chapter, or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remaining sections or
provisions and the application of such sections and provisions to any person or
circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid, shall not be
affected thereby, and it is hereby declared that such sections and provisions
would have been passed independently if such section or provision were so known
to be invalid. The adoption of this chapter in a single legislative act is
merely for convenience.
(Ord. 15-19.  Passed 11-16-15.)
884.99   VIOLATIONS; PENALTY.

applicant is permitted to occupy or do the things or acts specified in, upon,
under or over the street or public place in the City.  The City Manager may
deny a permit to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the public
right-of-way, or when necessary to protect the public right-of-way and its
users.  The City Manager, shall consider the following factors: the extent to
which public right-of-way space where the permit is sought is available; the
competing demands for the particular space in the right-of-way; the
availability of other locations in the public right-of-way or in other public
right-of-way or within utility easement areas outside of the right-of-way; the
applicability of ordinance or other regulations of the right-of- way that
affect location of elements in the right-of-way; the degree of compliance of
the applicant with the terms and conditions of its franchise, this chapter, and
other applicable ordinances and regulations; the degree of disruption to
surrounding communities and businesses that will result from the use of that
part of the public right-of-way; the condition and age of the public right-of-
way, and whether and when it is scheduled for total or partial reconstruction;
the balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage to the public
right-of-way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by the
expansion into additional parts of the public right-of-way; and the feasibility
of accomplishing the desired goal outside of the public right-of-way.

involved in major construction, the outside lanes may be striped wider than the
inside lanes if the following criteria are met, as determined by the Director
of Public Service, or his/her designee:
         A.   The segment of street being constructed or reconstructed must
have a continuous length of at least one-half mile, or connect to an existing
wide outside lane;
         B.   The street segment must have a driving surface in one direction
at least twenty-four feet wide, exclusive of curb and gutter sections;
         C.   The  Director of Public Service, or his/her designee must
determine that the street segment does not contain any unique geometrics or
other unusual circumstances that would cause the uneven lane widths to present
a hazard to the public health, safety and/or welfare; and
      (2)   The City is encouraged to make every reasonable effort to either
maintain traffic signal detectors that are sensitive to the presence of
bicycles or provide for other means of actuation of traffic signals for
bicyclists.
      (3)   When designing or reviewing plans for new streets or when
developing plans for the reconstruction of existing streets, the City and all
utility companies are encouraged to specify that storm water inlets containing
street grates, utility covers and other surface irregularities be designed to
be safe for the passage of bicycles.
      (4)   Wherever it has street maintenance responsibility, the City is
encouraged to make every reasonable effort to maintain transitions between
street surfaces and bridge decks, between street surfaces and concrete gutter
sections, and between street surfaces and any street grates, as smoothly as
possible.
   (b)   A Bicycle Committee is hereby established to advise the Director of
Public Service, or his/her designee of possible ways to improve conditions for
bicyclists on public streets when, in the exercise of his or her discretionary
authority and sound engineering judgment, such action is deemed to be
appropriate.

REVOCATION OF THE PERMIT.
   No language or provisions set forth in Codified Ordinances Chapter 1020, et

(Ord. 00-07.  Passed 8-21-00.)

(Ord. 00-07.  Passed 8-21-00.)

the City shall have a maximum time period of ninety consecutive calendar days
from the date a complete application for a Certificate of Registration by a
utility service provider is received by the City to make a decision on the

decision time, failure of the City to make a decision on an application for a
Certificate of Registration shall be considered the same as an approval of the
application by the City. 
(Ord. 00-07.  Passed 8-21-00.)
1030.25   CRITERIA FOR ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   (a)   In deciding whether to issue a Certificate of Registration, the City
Manager shall consider: whether the issuing of the Certificate of Registration
will contribute to the health, safety, and welfare of the City and its
citizens; whether issuing of the Certificate of Registration will be consistent
with this chapter; the impacts of the proposed location of applicant's elements
on aesthetic and architectural compatibility with the surrounding environment;
whether aesthetic and good planning principles have been given due
consideration, and that adverse impact on the environment has been minimized in
addition to minimizing the adverse aesthetic and visual impacts on the land,
property, buildings, and other facilities adjacent to, surrounding, and in
generally the same area as the requested location, which shall mean using the
least visually and physically intrusive elements (including associated
screening or vegetation) that is not technologically or commercially
impracticable under the facts and circumstances; whether the applicant has
submitted a complete application and has secured all certificates and other
authorizations required by law in order to construct and operate a system in
the manner proposed by the applicant; whether the applicant is delinquent on
any taxes or other obligations owed to the City, Montgomery County, Ohio, or

managerial, and technical ability to fulfill all the obligations under this
chapter and the issuance of a Certificate of Registration; and any other
applicable law.
   (b)   To protect the public health, safety, and welfare in recognition of
the limitation of space in the public right-of-way, the City Manager shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new facilities or additional
elements of an existing utility system within a public right-of-way if there is
insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of persons to occupy and
use the public right-of-way. In making such decisions, the City Manager shall
strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users
of the public right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of
the public interest, the public's needs for the particular utility service, the
condition of the public right-of-way, the time of year with respect to
essential utilities, the protection of existing elements of utility systems in
the public right-of-way, and future City plans for public improvements and
development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest.
(Ord. 00-07.  Passed 8-21-00; Ord. 08-12.  Passed 5-12-08.)
1030.26   DENIAL OF APPLICATION.
   The City Manager shall have the right to deny an application for a
Certificate of Registration for adequate cause. If requested in writing by the
applicant, the City Manager must provide to the applicant in written form
specific factual findings in support of the decision by the City Manager to
deny the application for a Certificate of Registration. Any decision by the
City Manager to deny an application for a Certificate of Registration is
appealable by the application to the City Council in the manner set forth in
Section
1030.40.
(Ord. 00-07.  Passed 8-21-00.)
1030.27   EXPIRATION OF CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   Unless terminated by the City at an earlier date, a Certificate of
Registration shall expire one year from the date of issuance by the City.
(Ord. 00-07.  Passed 8-21-00.)
1030.28   RESPONSIBILITIES OF UTILITY SERVICE PROVIDER WITH VALID CERTIFICATE
OF REGISTRATION.
   (a)   When required by these Codified Ordinances, a utility service provider
with a valid Certificate of Registration must obtain a revocable street
privilege permit.
   (b)   The provider must keep all the information required in the application
by the City current.
   (c)   When requested by the City, a public or private utility service
provider, with a utility system element located or proposed to be located in a
public right of way in the City, must meet with the City to co-ordinate future
plans for the public right of way between the utility service provider and the
City. 
   (d)   A utility service provider with any utility system element located or
proposed to be located in a right of way in the City must provide the City with
up-to-date accurate plans in sufficient detail and in a format acceptable to
the City showing the location of all elements of the utility system located in
the right of way in the City.
   (e)   In addition to a Certificate of Registration, providers shall obtain
any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses
necessary for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate
Federal, State and local authorities and, upon the City's reasonable request,
shall provide copies of such documents to the City.
   (f)   A Certificate of Registration issued pursuant to this chapter shall
not entitle a provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere with, the
facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable,
or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever under the
management or control of the City.
(Ord. 00-07.  Passed 8-21-00.)
1030.29   NATURE OF ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   A Certificate of Registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in
the rights of way. A Certificate of Registration is only the nonexclusive,
limited right to occupy rights of way in the City for the limited purpose and
for the limited period stated in the Certificate of Registration and in
accordance with this chapter and any associated permit. For those providers
with a valid gas or electric franchise, the provisions of a Certificate of
Registration shall be deemed as regulatory in nature and shall not be
interpreted to limit the right to occupy the rights of way which may have been
granted by such franchise.  The rights to occupy the right of way itself may
not be subdivided or subleased, provided, however, that two or more providers
may collocate facilities in the same area of the rights of way so long as each
such provider complies with the provisions of this chapter. A Certificate of
Registration does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or
pole attachment agreements before collocating its facilities on facilities of
others, including the City's facilities. A Certificate of Registration does not
prevent a provider from leasing space in or on the provider's system, so long
as the sharing of facilities does not cause a violation of law, including the
provisions of this chapter. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a
provider from complying with any provisions of this chapter and other
applicable law.
(Ord. 00-07.  Passed 8-21-00.)
1030.30   RELOCATION OF EQUIPMENT.
   (a)   A provider must promptly and at its own expense, with due regard for
seasonal working conditions, permanently remove and relocate its equipment and
facilities in the right of way whenever the City Manager requests such removal
and relocation, and shall restore the right of way to the same condition it was
in prior to said removal or relocation. The City Manager may make such request
to prevent interference by the Company's equipment or facilities with (i) a
present or future City use of the right of way, (ii) a public improvement
undertaken by the City, (iii) an economic development project in which the City
has an interest or investment, (iv) when the public health, safety and welfare
require it, or (v) when necessary to prevent interference with the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel over the right of way.
   (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person shall not be required to
remove or relocate its equipment from any right of way which has been vacated
in favor of a non-governmental entity unless and until the reasonable costs
thereof are first paid to the person therefor.
(Ord. 00-07.  Passed 8-21-00.)
1030.31   PRE-EXCAVATION EQUIPMENT LOCATION.
   Before the start date of any right of way excavation, each provider who has
equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal and approximate
vertical placement of all said equipment. Any provider whose equipment is less
that twenty inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work
closely with the excavation contractor to establish the exact location of its
equipment and the best procedure for excavation.
(Ord. 00-07.  Passed 8-21-00.)
1030.32   DAMAGE TO OTHER EQUIPMENT.
   (a)   When the City does or causes to be done work in the right of way and
finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a provider's equipment to
protect it, the City Manager shall notify the local representative as early as
is reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that
provider and must be paid within thirty days from the date of billing.
   (b)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
equipment in the right of way which it or its equipment damages. Each provider
shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the equipment of
another provider caused during the City's response to an emergency occasioned
by that provider's equipment.
(Ord. 00-07.  Passed 8-21-00.)
1030.33   RIGHT OF WAY VACATION.
   (a)   If the City vacates a right of way which contains the equipment of a
provider, and if the vacation does not require the relocation of the provider's
equipment, the City shall reserve, to and for itself and all providers having
equipment in the vacated right of way, the right to install, maintain and
operate any equipment in the vacated right of way and to enter upon such right
of way at any time for the purpose of reconstructing, inspecting, maintaining
or repairing the same.
   (b)   If the vacation requires the relocation of the provider's equipment;
and (i) if the vacation proceedings are initiated by the provider, the provider
must pay the relocation costs; or (ii) if the vacation proceedings are
initiated by the City, the provider must pay the relocation costs unless
otherwise agreed to by the City and the provider; or (iii) if the vacation
proceedings are initiated by a person or persons other than the provider, such
other person or persons must pay the relocation costs.
(Ord. 00-07.  Passed 8-21-00.)
1030.34   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS; ABANDONED EQUIPMENT; REMOVAL.
   (a)   Discontinued Operations. A provider who has determined to discontinue
its operations in the City must either:
      (1)   Provide information satisfactory to the City Manager that the
provider's obligations for its equipment in the right of way under this chapter
have been lawfully assumed by another provider; or
      (2)   Submit to the City Manager a proposal and instruments for
transferring ownership of its equipment to the City. If a provider proceeds
under this clause, the City may, at its option: purchase the equipment; require
the provider, at its own expense, to remove it; or require the provider to post
a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the City for reasonably anticipated
costs to be incurred in removing the equipment.
   (b)   Abandoned Equipment. Equipment of a provider who fails to comply with
the discontinued operations provisions of this chapter and which remains unused
shall be deemed to be abandoned. Unused equipment means facilities located in
the rights of way which have remained unused for a period of two years and for
which the provider is unable to:  (i) provide the City with a credible plan
detailing the procedure by which the provider intends to begin actively using
such facilities within the next twelve months; or (ii) that it has a potential
purchaser or user of the facilities who will be actively using the facilities
within the next twelve months; or (iii) that the availability of such
facilities is required by the provider to adequately and efficiently operate
its system. Abandoned equipment is deemed to be a nuisance. The City may
exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not
limited to: (i) abating the nuisance; (ii) taking possession of the equipment
and restoring it to a useable condition; or (iii) requiring removal of the
equipment by the provider, or the provider's successor in interest.
   (c)   Removal. Any provider who has unused and abandoned equipment in any
right of way shall remove it from that right of way during the next scheduled
excavation, or at such different time as designated by the City Manager, unless
this requirement is waived by the City Manager.
   (d)   Conflicts of Law. In the event of any conflict between the provisions
of this section and with Federal law known as the Miller Act, the provisions of
the Miller Act shall control.
(Ord. 00-07.  Passed 8-21-00.)
1030.35   WRITTEN NOTICE OF VIOLATIONS.
   The City Manager shall give written notice of violation to a provider if it
is determined that a provider has: violated any material provision or
requirement of the issuance or acceptance of a Certificate of Registration or
any law of the City, State or Federal government; or attempted to evade any
provision or requirement of the issuance of a Certificate of Registration or
the acceptance of it; or practiced any fraud or deceit upon the City; or made a
material misrepresentation of fact in its application for a Certificate of
Registration.
(Ord. 00-07.  Passed 8-21-00.)
1030.36   FAILURE TO CURE VIOLATIONS.
   If a provider fails to cure a violation within thirty calendar days after
such notice is served by the City then such violation shall be a material
breach and the City may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in
equity to terminate the Certificate of Registration.  If the City Manager
decides there is cause or reason to terminate, the following procedure shall be
followed:
   (a)   City shall serve a provider with a written notice of the reason or
cause for proposed termination and shall allow a provider a minimum of ten
calendar days to cure its breach.
   (b)   If the provider fails to cure within ten calendar days, the City
Manager may declare the Certificate of Registration terminated.
   (c)   The determination of the City Manager shall be final.
(Ord. 00-07.  Passed 8-21-00.)
1030.37   REVOCABLE STREET PRIVILEGE PERMIT.
   (a)   Permit Application.  An application for a revocable street privilege
permit shall be in accordance with Chapter 1020 of these Codified Ordinances,
including any additional requirements contained in this chapter of these
Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   Permit Requirements.  The requirements in this chapter shall be in
addition to any requirement set forth in these Codified Ordinances Chapter
1020, et seq.
      (1)   A utility service provider must have a valid Certificate of
Registration on file with the City, before the City may issue a revocable
street privilege permit.
      (2)   When practical, in the opinion of the City, the policy of the City
is to require the underground location of a new utility system element in the
public right of way.
      (3)   The construction, demolition or removal of any element of a utility
system in a public right of way by a utility service provider must be
accomplished in a practical manner which, in the opinion of the City, results
in the least potential amount of damage and disruption of the public right of
way.
      (4)   The applicant shall provide a specific timetable for the permit
work to be accomplished within, detailed plans, accurate scale drawings, and
specifications in sufficient detail acceptable to the City to describe the area
of work covered in the permit application. In addition, the City may require
the applicant to provide up-to-date, accurate, comprehensive master plans of
the existing and proposed utility system. These master plans are intended to
allow the City to consider the broader context of the utility service
provider's plans upon which the permit application is based.
   (c)   Limitations on Placement of Utility System Elements and/or Permissive
Denial of Permit.
      (1)   To protect the public health, safety, and welfare in recognition of
the limitation of space in the public right of way, the City Manager shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of a new utility system or
additional elements of an existing utility system within a public right of way
if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of persons to
occupy and use the public right of way. In making such decisions, the City
Manager shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and
potential users of the public right of way, but shall be guided primarily by
considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the particular
utility service, the condition of the public right of way, the time of year
with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing elements of
utility systems in the public right of way, and future City plans for public
improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the
public interest.
      (2)   The City Manager may deny a permit to protect the public health,
safety and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of
ordinary travel over the public right of way, or when necessary to protect the
public right of way and its users.  The City Manager, in his or her discretion,
may consider one of more of the following factors: the extent to which public
right of way space where the permit is sought is available; the competing
demands for the particular space in the right of way; the availability of other
locations in the public right of way or in other public rights of way for the
utility system elements of the permit applicant; the applicability of ordinance
or other regulations of the right of way that affect location of utility system
elements in the right of way; the degree of compliance of the applicant with
the terms and conditions of its franchise, this chapter, and other applicable
ordinances and regulations; the degree of disruption to surrounding communities
and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the public right
of way; the condition and age of the public right of way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial reconstruction; the balancing of the costs
of disruption to the public and damage to the public right of way, against the
benefits to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional
parts of the public right of way; and the feasibility of accomplishing the
desired goal outside of the public right of way.

1030.38   NONLIABILITY OF CITY.
   By reason of the acceptance of an application or the grant of a permit, the

1030.39   INDEMNIFICATION.
   By applying for and being issued a Certificate of Registration with the City

to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the City's agents, elected officials,
officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors from all costs, liabilities,
claims, and suits for damages of any kind arising out of the construction,
presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of its facilities, or
out of any activity undertaken in or near a right of way, whether any act or
omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by a permit,
excepting only negligent acts or omissions that are willful and wanton or
intentional torts and for which immunity is not provided by the Ohio Revised
Code for such acts, omissions, or intentional torts. This exception shall not
extend to acts, omissions, or intentional torts occurring as a result of or in
response to an emergency. A provider further agrees that it will not bring, nor
cause to be brought, any action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or
seeking any other relief against the City's agents, elected officials,
officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors or any claim nor for any
award arising out of the presence, installation, maintenance or operation of
its facilities, or any activity undertaken in or near a right of way, whether
the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a
permit. This chapter is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or
immunity otherwise available to the provider or to the City, and the provider,
in defending any action on behalf of the City, if allowable by law, shall be
entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could
assert in its own behalf. Any and all exercises of the above shall be
consistent with, but not limited to, the following:
   (a)   To the fullest extent permitted by law, each provider shall, at its
sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its
agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors
from and against any and all lawsuits, claims (including, without limitation,
workers' compensation claims against the City or others), causes of action,
liability, and judgments for injury or damages, including, but not limited to,
expenses for reasonable legal fees and disbursements assumed by the City
related to the following:
      (1)   Injuries or damages to persons or property, in any way arising out
of or through the acts or omissions of provider, its subcontractors, agents or
employees attributable to the occupation by the provider of the rights of way,
to which provider's negligence shall in any way contribute, and regardless of
whether the City's negligence or the negligence of any other party shall have
contributed to such claim, cause of action, judgment, injury or damage.
      (2)   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy, for
defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement of
any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other right
of any person, firm and corporation by the provider, by excluding claims
arising out of or related to City programming.
      (3)   Arising out of provider's failure to comply with the provisions of
any law applicable to the provider.
   (b)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the City:
      (1)   Giving provider reasonable notice of any claim or the commencement
of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is sought;
      (2)   Affording the provider the opportunity to fully participate in any
discussions concerning any compromise, settlement, or other resolution or
disposition of any claim or proceeding subject to indemnification, as well as
the sole right to approve any compromise or settlement or financial commitment,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld;
      (3)   Cooperating in the defense of such claim and making available to
the provider all pertinent information under the City's control.
   (c)   The City shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such
action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense
thereof, and the provider shall pay all reasonable fees and expense of such
separate counsel if employed.

      (1)   Each Certificate of Registration for Small Cell shall be classified
as one of three types.  The three types of applications are:
         A.   1.   Small Cell Minor. An application that:
            2.   Involves removal or replacement of small cell facilities and
any associated equipment on an existing wireless support; and such removal or
replacement does not  constitute a substantial change.
         B.   Small Cell Substantial. An application that:
            1.   Involves the installation of a new small cell facility on a
wireless support structure; or
            2.   Involves the removal or replacement of a small cell facility
on an existing wireless support structure and such removal or replacement
constitutes a substantial change.
         C.   Wireless Support Structure. An application for a proposal to
construct, modify or replace a wireless support structure in the right-of-way.
      (2)   Applications seeking to collocate a small cell facility to a
wireless support structure owned by the City and located within the City right-
of-way shall also be required to obtain an Attachment Certificate and shall be
subject to an attachment fee in an amount set by the City's Fee Schedule.
      (3)   Pursuant to Ohio R. C. 4939.0312(A) the City shall permit a person
seeking to construct, modify, collocate, or replace more than one small cell
facility or more than one wireless support structure within the jurisdiction of
a single municipal corporation to file,  at the person's discretion, a
consolidated application for consent for up to 30 small cell facilities
requests in a single application or up to 30 wireless support structure
requests in a single application and receive a single permit for the
construction, modification, collocation, or replacement of the small cell
facilities or wireless support structures. However, this single application may
only address multiple small cell facilities or multiple wireless support
structures if they each involve substantially the same type of small cell
facilities or substantially the same type of wireless support structures. The
City may separately address small cell facility collocations or wireless
support structures for which incomplete information has been received or which
are denied.  In the case of a consolidated  application, the applicable fees
shall be cumulative.  In the case of a consolidated application, each small
cell facility or wireless support structure proposed to be constructed,
modified, collocated on, or replaced shall constitute a separate request for
consent for purposes of tolling the response deadline.

      (2)   Location.
         A.   In accordance with Ohio R.C. 4939.0314(D), Authority of a
Municipal Corporation, the City shall reserve the right to propose an alternate
location to the proposed location of a new wireless support structure, provided
the alternate location is within 100' or a distance equal to the width of the
right-of-way in or on which the new wireless support structure is proposed,
whichever is greater.  The City also finds that certain locations and
collocation configurations are preferred. A preferred location and collocation
configuration should be utilized whenever possible and should only be surpassed
if in the determination of the Director of Public Service, clear and convincing
evidence supports such a decision. Cost alone should not be grounds for such a
determination. The order of preference is as follows:
            1.   First, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement.  If no
such pole or wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next
preference;
            2.   Second, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within an alley.  If no such pole
or wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
            3.   Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within a utility easement.  If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            4.   Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley.  If no such location is available
then proceed to the next preference;
            5.   Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a
wireless support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located
within the City right-of-way. If no such wireless support structure is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            6.   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole located within the City right-of-way.  If no such existing pole
is available then proceed to the next preference;
            7.   Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within a utility easement.  If no such
location is available then proceed to the next preference;
            8.   Eighth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within an alley.  If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            9.   Ninth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the City right-of-way.
         B.   New wireless support structures shall be spaced from other small
cell facilities consistent with the average spacing of the existing utility
poles and street light poles along that portion of the right of way and if
none, no closer than 500 feet unless such spacing requirement shall prohibit,
or have the effect of prohibiting, the provision of wireless service to any
location.
      (3)   Wireless Facilities Design.

subject to the following design standards:
            1.   a.   The City reserves the right to require the following:
               b.   Antenna and all associated equipment shall be concealed to
the extent deemed necessary by the Director of Public Service in response to
the aesthetic context of the small cell facility.  Some possible configurations
include but shall not be limited to the following:
                  (i)   Antenna(s) associated with the first fitting on a
wireless support structure shall be top-mounted and concealed within a radome
that also conceals the cable connections, antenna mount and other hardware. 
The Director of Public Service may approve a side-mounted antenna with the
initial fitting if, in the Director of Public Service's discretion, the side-
mounted antenna would be a better match to the aesthetics and character of the
immediate area and would promote the purposes of this chapter.
                  (ii)   GPS antennas be placed within the radome or directly
above the radome not to exceed six inches.
            2.   Each antenna and all associated equipment shall not exceed six
cubic feet in volume.
            3.   All portions of a small cell facility other than an antenna
and as identified by the Ohio R.C. 4939.01(P)2, shall not exceed 28 cubic feet
in volume per facility.
            4.   Small cell facilities mounted to a wireless support structure
shall be completely concealed within a common enclosure capable of containing
at least two small sell facilities.  Such common enclosures shall:

inches in depth;
               c.   Not extend more than 24 inches away from the pole on which
it is mounted;
               d.   Shall be centered on the vertical axis of the pole to which
it is mounted;
               e.   Be mounted at a distance of at least ten feet measured from
grade to the bottom of the enclosure;
               f.   Be mounted on the side of the pole facing away from nearest
traffic lane's direction of travel.
            5.   Such common enclosures shall have the following design
elements:
               a.   Material. The enclosure material shall be metal, a
composite, or an equivalent material as determined by the Director of Public
Service.
               b.   Color. The enclosure shall match the color of the pole on
which it is mounted.
               c.   Style. The enclosure shall match the style of the pole on
which it is mounted.
               d.   Coordinated Design Elements. Common enclosures shall match
the material, color, and style of nearby existing common enclosures when:
                  (i)   Such enclosures are located within 5000' of an existing
common enclosure; and
                  (ii)   Such enclosures are mounted on wireless support
structures of a similar or matching design.
               e.   Exception. If the aesthetics and character of the immediate
area would be better matched by an enclosure a different material, color,
style, or by deviating from the design of a nearby existing common enclosure as
determined by the Director of Public Service, then such design elements may be
substituted with an alternate design element.  Such determination shall be
based on the following factors:
                  (i)   The design features of nearby poles serving in a
similar capacity;
                  (ii)   The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
                  (iii)   The historical context of a district or specific
site;
                  (iv)   A desire to camouflage or conceal the enclosure from
view.
            6.   For ground mounted equipment:
               a.   (i)   Concealed Enclosure. All equipment shall be
completely concealed within a metal, composite, or equivalent material
enclosure as determined by the Director of Public Service.

necessary based on the smallest available size of the proposed equipment as
determined by the Director of Public Service.
                  (iii)   Camouflage. Camouflaging elements may be required. 
Such elements may include, but shall not be limited to, public art displayed on
the enclosure, strategic placement in less visible or obtrusive locations,
placement within an existing streetscape element, landscape screening, and
strategic painting or coating to camouflage such enclosure or equipment.
               b.   The maximum height of any such enclosure shall be 30";
provided, however, if permittee shows that it does not use 30" enclosures at
any other location in the country, the maximum height may be adjusted as
determined by the Director of Public Service to the smallest enclosure used
elsewhere in the country but not exceeding 48 inches.
   (c)   Reservation of Right-of-Way.
      (1)   The City reserves the right to reserve space for future public
safety or transportation uses in the right-of-way or on a wireless support
structure or pole owned or operated by the City in a documented and approved
plan in place at the time an application is filed.  A reservation of space
shall not preclude placement of a pole or collocation of a small cell
facility.  If replacement of the City's pole or wireless support structure is
necessary to accommodate the collocation of the small cell facility and the
future use, the small cell facility operator shall pay for the replacement of
the pole or wireless support structure, and the replaced pole or wireless
support structure must accommodate the future use.
      (2)   The Director of Public Service is authorized to make requests and
to issue orders regarding utility installations in the right of way for the
purpose of public safety and compliance with this chapter. The Director of
Public Service is also authorized to conduct visual and external inspections of
utility installations in the right of way at any time and shall make efforts to

   (d)   The provisions of this section are in addition to all other
requirements of the City with regard to the installation and use of water
service to any user of such service within the City.
(Ord. 67-10.  Passed 4-17-67.)
1042.25   SECONDARY WATER METERS.
   (a)   Any customer serviced by the City’s Water System has the option of
installing a separate, secondary water meter for the flow that does not
terminate in the sanitary sewer system.  The cost of installation is hereby
established at forty dollars ($40.00), plus the current cost of the meter and
wireless transmitter.  Payment of all such costs shall be the sole
responsibility of the customer.  Additionally, a service charge of ten dollars
($10.00) will be assessed to the customer each time if they choose to have the
water turned off or turned on by the City.  Billings to this secondary meter
will not reflect sewer or wastewater treatment charges.  There will be no
minimum monthly charge for the secondary water service.  Customers will only be
billed for their actual usage.
   (b)   The secondary water meter shall be located inside the primary
structure of the premises in a reasonably accessible location.  City personnel
shall be permitted access to the meter for the purpose of taking readings,
meter replacement or repair.  The failure of the customer to permit such access
will result in sewer and wastewater charges being billed to the secondary
service for the period during which access is denied.
(Ord. 92-12.  Passed 7-6-92; Ord. 15-12.  Passed 6-15-15.)
1042.26   WELL FIELD PROTECTION FUND CHARGE.
   There is imposed a monthly charge of one dollar and sixty cents ($1.60) for
the Tipp City wellfield protection for the sole purpose of maintaining a non-
contaminated drinking water supply which shall be a separate charge and
designated on the utility bill as “WFP”.
(Ord. 97-05. Passed 4-21-97; Ord. 17-31.  Passed 12-18-17.)
1042.99   PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter, for which no
penalty is otherwise provided, is guilty of a minor misdemeanor for a first
offense and shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).  For a
second or subsequent offense, such person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree and shall be fined not more than two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both.
   (b)   For any installation contrary to Section
1042.24, a separate offense shall be deemed committed each day such
installation continues.

described substances, materials, waters or wastes if it appears likely that
such wastes can harm either the sewers, sewage treatment processes or
equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving stream, otherwise endanger
life, limb or public property, or constitute a nuisance. In forming an opinion
as to the acceptability of these wastes, consideration will be given to such
factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities
in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, the nature of the
sewage treatment process, the capacity of the sewage treatment plant, the
degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant and other
pertinent factors. Prohibited substances include:
      (1)   Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150 degrees
Fahrenheit (sixty-five degrees Centigrade), but in no case heat in amounts
which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW, thus resulting in
interference, or heat in such quantities that the temperature at the POTW
treatment plant exceeds 104 degrees Fahrenheit (forty degrees Centigrade).
      (2)   Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease or oils, whether
emulsified or not, in excess of 100 mg/l, unless otherwise permitted by the
City, or containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at
temperatures between 32 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (0 and 65 degrees
Centigrade). Discharges of petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil or
products of mineral oil origin are prohibited if discharged in amounts that can
pass through or cause interference;
      (3)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. The installation
and operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor of three-fourths
horsepower (0.76 hp metric) or greater shall be subject to the review and
approval of the City.
      (4)   Any waters or wastes containing acid iron pickling wastes, or
concentrated plating solutions, whether neutralized or not, without prior
approval by the City;
      (5)   Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc and
similar objectionable or toxic substances, or wastes exerting an excessive
chlorine requirement to such a degree that any such material received in the
composite sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits established
by the City for such materials;
      (6)   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor-
producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be
established by the City as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage,
to meet the requirements of the State, Federal or other public agencies of
jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters;
      (7)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such a half-life or
concentration as may exceed established limits in compliance with applicable
State or Federal regulations;
      (8)   Materials which exert or cause:
         A.   Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but
not limited to, Fullers earth, lime slurries and lime residues) or of dissolved
solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate);
         B.   Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions);
         C.   Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand or chlorine requirements in
such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment
works; or
         D.   Unusual volumes of flow or concentration of wastes constituting
slugs;
      (9)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or which are
amenable to treatment only to such a degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters; or
      (10)   Any wastewater that causes the receiving plant to violate the
conditions of its NPDES permit.
   (e)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged, to the public sewers, which waters or wastes contain the substances
or possess the characteristics enumerated in this section, and which waters or
wastes may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes,
equipment or receiving waters, or otherwise create a hazard to life or
constitute a public nuisance, the City may:
      (1)   Reject the wastes;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
      (3)   
Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under Section
1044.06.
   If the City permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the City and to the requirements of all applicable
codes, ordinances and laws.
   (f)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when they are
necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in
excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients.
However, such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or
dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by
the County/City and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection.
   (g)   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided
for waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and
effective operation by the owner at his or her expense.
   (h)   When required by the City, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole, together with such meters and other appurtenances in the building
sewer as are necessary to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of
the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the City. The
manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or her expense and shall be
maintained by him or her so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (i)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wages to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136, and shall be determined at the control
manhole provided or upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. If no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer from the point at which
the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property.
      (1)   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based
on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
      (2)   The user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW.  Where time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must
be representative of the discharge.  Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows:  for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. 
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City as
appropriate.  In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
Instantaneous Limits.
      (3)   Samples for oil and grease, temperatures, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (4)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds
for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities
for which historical sampling data are available, the POTW may authorize a
lower minimum.  For these reports, the user is required to collect the number
of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (j)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to payment of a surcharge
based on the strength and character of the waste, provided that such payment is
in accordance with Federal and State guidelines for user charge systems and
industrial cost recovery systems.  No agreement shall be made which violates
any State or Federal standard or requirements, including categorical
pretreatment standards.
   (k)   The City may reject any industrial waste which may not be compatible
with the treatment process or the sewage works. Further, the City may require
pretreatment of industrial wastes if deemed necessary, and may impose a
surcharge commensurate with any added difficulty or added direct cost
associated with an industrial waste.
   (l)   No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in
any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute
for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or
requirement. This subsection shall not prohibit the use of equalization tanks
utilized to regulate flows.
   (m)   National categorical pretreatment standards, as promulgated by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) pursuant to the Act,
shall be met by all industrial users who or which are subject to such
standards.
   (n)   State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW shall be
met by all dischargers who or which are subject to those standards in any
instance in which such standards are more stringent than Federal requirements
and limitations, the requirements of this chapter or the requirements of any
other applicable ordinance.
   (o)   No discharger shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the sewer
water any pollutants in concentrations above those specifically permitted in a
wastewater discharge permit issued by the City. Discharge permits shall impose
maximum discharge concentration limits or mass-based limits where appropriate
and except as allowed in
1044.05(o)(1) through (8) below. In the absence of such specific wastewater
discharge permit conditions, no person shall discharge wastewater containing
pollutants in excess of the limits specified in the subdistrict's approved and
amended pretreatment program for the North Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant.
A list of such limitations shall be provided by the City, upon request.
      (1)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the POTW
may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
      (2)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the POTW shall impose
an alternate limit in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.6(e).
      (3)   A categorical industrial user may obtain a net/gross adjustment to
a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs
of this section.
         A.   Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the
presence of pollutants in the Industrial User's intake water in accordance with
this section.  Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to the POTW.  Upon request of the industrial
user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (meaning,
adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the following
requirements are met.
            1.   Either the applicable categorical pretreatment standards
contained in 40 C.F.R. subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be
applied on a net basis or the industrial user demonstrates that the control
system it proposes or used to meet applicable categorical pretreatment
standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the
absence of pollutants in the intake water.
            2.   Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be
granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the
generic measure in the user's effluent are substantially similar to the
constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate
additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall
or elsewhere.
            3.   Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet
the applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value
equal to the influent value.  Additional monitoring may be necessary to
determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted
under this section.
            4.   Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the
intake water is drawn from the same body of water into which the POTW
discharges. The POTW may waive this requirement if it finds that no
environmental degradation will result.
      (4)   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the POTW
convert the limits to equivalent mass limits.  The determination to convert
concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the POTW.  The
POTW may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all
the conditions set forth in Section
1044.05(o)(4)A. through E.
         A.   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its individual wastewater discharge permit;
         B.   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         C.   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual
average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous
effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average
production rate.  Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term
average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions;
         D.   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limts are not appropriate to
control the discharge; and
         E.   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request
for equivalent mass limits.
         F.   An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
            1.   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
            2.   Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use
of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
            3.   Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify
the POTW whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20% from
its baseline production rates.
            4.   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to those in division (o)
(4)A. of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
         G.   When developing equivalent mass limits, the POTW:
            1.   Will calculate the equivalent mass limits by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial
user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for
the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
            2.   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
            3.   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial user's actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of
water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow
rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limits were not
based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment.  The industrial
user must also be in compliance with Section
1044.13(f) regarding the prohibition of bypass.
      (5)   The POTW may convert the mass limits of the categorical
pretreatment standards of 40 C.F.R. Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration
limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual
industrial users.  The conversion is at the discretion of the POTW.
      (6)   Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with
the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated
categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
      (7)   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations.  Where
such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be
used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.
      (8)   Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based
standard shall notify the POTW within two business days after the user has a
reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change
within the next calendar month.  Any user not notifying the POTW of such
anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in
its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average
production rate.
   (p)   Non-Significant Categorical User.  The POTW may determine that an
industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards is a non-
significant categorical industrial user rather than a significant categorical
industrial user on a finding that the industrial user never discharges more
than 100 gallons per day (GPD) of total categorical wastewater (excluding
sanitary, non-contact cooling and boiler blow down wastewater, unless
specifically included in the pretreatment standard) and the following
conditions are met:
      (1)   The industrial user, prior to the POTW's finding, has consistently
complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards and
requirements;
      (2)   The industrial user annually submits the required certification
statement together with any additional information necessary to support the
certification statement; and
      (3)   The industrial user never discharges any untreated concentrated
wastewater.
      (4)   If the IU is located upstream of a combined or sanitary sewer
overflow the following additional requirements must be met of the application
of this classification:
         A.   The IU cannot discharge wastewater that is regulated by
categorical pretreatment standards or;
         B.   Must not have been in significant noncompliance at any time in
the past two years.
         C.   Procedures for categorization of an IU as a non-significant
categorical industrial user and the issues related to combined sewer overflows
must be addressed through either the long term control plan, approved combined
system operation plan implementing the nine minimum controls, or the program
modification request.
      (5)   The POTW must evaluate and document, at least once per year,
whether the industrial user continues to meet the requirements for the
classification.
      (6)   Upon a finding that a user meeting the criteria in Section
1044.05(p)(1) through (4) has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting
the POTW's operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement,
the POTW may at any time on its own initiative or in response to a petition
received from an industrial user, and in accordance with procedures in 40
C.F.R. 403.8(f)(6), determine that such user should not be considered a
significant industrial user.
   (q)   Mid-Tier Categorical Industrial Users.  A categorical industrial user
may be considered a mid-tier categorical industrial user.
      (1)   This classification requires that the IU does not discharge total
categorical wastewater that exceeds:
         A.   Zero point zero one percent (0.01%) of the design dry weather
hydraulic capacity of the POTW;
         B.   Five thousand gallons per day of total categorical wastewater;
         C.   Zero point zero one percent (0.01%) of the design dry weather
organic treatment capacity of the POTW; and
         D.   Zero point zero percent (0.01%) of the maximum allowable
headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical
pretreatment standards for which a local limit has been developed.
      (2)   The IU's flow must be measured by a continuous effluent flow
monitoring device unless the IU discharges in batches.
      (3)   The IU must not have been in significant noncompliance for any time
in the past two years.
      (4)   The daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels of the
IU cannot vary so significantly that decreasing the reporting requirement would
result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the
reporting period.
      (5)   If the IU is located upstream of a combined or sanitary sewer
overflow, procedures for categorization of an IU as a mid-tier categorical
industrial user and the issues related to combined and sanitary sewer overflows
must be addressed through either:
         A.   The long-term control plan;
         B.   Approved combined sewer system operation plan implementing the
nine minimum controls; or
         C.   The program modification request.
      (6)   Any IU classified as a mid-tier categorical industrial user will be
required to be inspected and the effluent randomly sampled and analyzed by the
POTW at least once every two years.  If the IU no longer meets the criteria for
being classified as a mid-tier categorical industrial user the POTW must
immediately begin inspecting the IU and monitoring the effluent at the
frequency set by the POTW's pretreatment program.
      (7)   As a mid-tier categorical industrial user the control authority may
reduce the IU's reporting frequency to no less than once a year unless required
more frequently by the categorical pretreatment standard or the Director of the
Ohio EPA.
      (8)   If the IU no longer meets the criteria for being classified as a
mid-tier categorical industrial user the IU must immediately begin monitoring
the effluent and complying with the minimum reporting requirements at the
frequency set by the POTW's pretreatment program.
   (r)   Monitoring Waivers.  The POTW may authorize, at its discretion, an
industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, except for
centralized waste treatment facilities regulated by and defined in 40 C.F.R.
437, to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment
standard.
      (1)   Monitoring waivers do not apply to pollutants where certifications
processes and requirements are established by the POTW or by categorical
pretreatment standards (e.g. a Total Organics Management Plan's certification
alternative to sampling) unless allowed for by the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard.
      (2)   If a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be
present based on changes that occur in the IU's operations, the user shall be
required to immediately notify the POTW in writing and start monitoring the
pollutant at the frequency specified in the POTW's pretreatment program.
      (3)   The monitoring waiver applies only to IU self-monitoring and does
not remove the POTW's obligations for IU monitoring for that parameter;
however, the waiver can be extended to POTW monitoring done to satisfy IU self-
monitoring.
      (4)   In making its request for a pollutant monitoring exemption, the
industrial user must demonstrate through sampling an other technical factors
that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the
discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and
without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user.
The industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the
facility's process wastewater prior to treatment present at the facility that
is representative wastewater from all processes.  Non-detectable sample results
may only be used as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the
USEPA approved analytical method form 40 C.F.R. 136 with the lowest method
detection limit for that pollutant was used.
      (5)   Waivers are valid only for the duration of the effective period of
the IU's control mechanism and, in no case, longer than five years.  The IU
must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for
each subsequent control mechanism.
      (6)   The request for a monitoring waiver shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user in accordance with paragraph
(F) of O.A.C. rule 3745-3-06, and it must include the certification statement
in 40 C.F.R. 403.6(a)(2)(ii).
      (7)   The POTW shall include any monitoring waiver as a condition in the
industrial user's control mechanism.  The supporting reason(s) for a monitoring
waiver and the information submitted by the user in its request shall be
maintained in the industrial user's file by the POTW for three years after
expiration of the waiver.
      (8)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the IU's
control mechanism by the POTW, the IU shall certify on each self-monitoring
report with the following statement:  "Based on my inquiry of the person or
persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the pretreatment
standards under 40 C.F.R. [specific national pretreatment standard part], I
certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no
increased in the level of [listed pollutant] in the wastewaters due to the
activities at the facility since the submittal of the last periodic report
under paragraph (E) of rule 3745-3-06 of the Ohio Administrative Code."
   (s)   If a violation is detected through sampling and analysis conducted by
the POTW in lieu of the industrial user, the control authority shall perform
the repeat sampling and analysis within 30 days of becoming aware of the
violation unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to
perform the repeat sampling and analysis.

1044.06   WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   Basis for Wastewater Service Charges. The wastewater service charge
for use of the public sewers and for services supplied by or through the City
shall consist of a charge for collection and a charge for treatment. These
charges shall be established to defray the cost of administration, operation,
maintenance and major replacement and debt service.
   (b)   Collection System Charge. The collection system charge shall consist
of a minimum charge, plus a use charge based on flow. Notwithstanding anything
in section
1044.06  to the contrary, in the event that City provided water services has
been turned off at the request of the property owner, there shall be no monthly
minimum collection system charge.
   (c)   Treatment System Charge. The treatment system charge for normal
domestic sewage and for discharges that are less than 240 mg/l BOD, less than
240 mg/l suspended solids and less than 36 mg/l ammonia nitrogen and that
contain no incompatible pollutants shall consist of a flow charge.

separate specific agreement specifying rates, terms and conditions of usage
measured on a bulk or large quantity basis, the charge shall be based upon the
quantity of water used as measured by the water meter. Such meter shall be
approved by Council and the charge shall be made monthly or otherwise, at the
discretion of Council. The rates to be charged shall be as authorized in
paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(3) and subsection (e) hereof, plus fifty percent for
billing, operation, maintenance, major replacement and debt service.
      (3)   If a lot, parcel of land, building or premises discharges sanitary
sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the Municipal sanitary
system, either directly or indirectly, and is not a user of water supplied
under the Municipal Utilities Department, and the water used is not measured by
a Municipal water meter or by a meter acceptable to Council, and the owner or
interested party does not want, at his or her expense, to install and maintain
a meter acceptable to Council for such purpose, then, in each case, the amount
of water so used shall be determined by the following rates:

   The charge levied by or pursuant to this chapter shall be billed monthly.
      (4)   If a lot, parcel of land, building or premises discharges
industrial wastes, either directly or indirectly, into the Municipal sanitary
sewerage system, and Council finds that it is not practical to attempt to
measure such wastes by a meter, Council shall measure such wastes in such
manner and by such method as it may find practical in light of conditions and
attendant circumstances of the case in order to determine the sewer service
charge or rental in accordance with the corresponding rates provided in this
chapter.
      (5)   All sewer rental charges levied or incurred prior to the effective
date of this chapter (Ordinance 86-8, passed May 19, 1986) and remaining
unpaid, shall remain payable and be collected at the same rates as were
previously provided.
   (e)   Application of Surcharge. A surcharge shall be levied for wastes
stronger than normal domestic sewage. The surcharge shall consist of a
component for operation, maintenance and replacement and a component for debt
plus reserves. The surcharge shall be based on water usage as recorded by water
meters and/or sewage meters for all wastes which exceed 240 mg/l BOD, 240 mg/
l suspended solids or 36 mg/l ammonia nitrogen. Other waste characteristics
shall be surcharged if they increase the cost of wastewater treatment in excess
of that for treatment of normal domestic sewage. The surcharges are as follows:
   BOD in excess of 240 mg/l:
 
OM&R  $ 0.0314
Debt  $ 0.0696
Total $ 0.101  / excess pound
 
   Suspended solids in excess of 240 mg/l:
 
OM&R  $ 0.0292
Debt  $ 0.0428
Total $ 0.072  / excess pound
 
   Ammonia nitrogen in excess of 36 mg/l:
 
OM&R $ 0.1908
Debt $ 0.1022
     $ 0.293 / excess pound
 
   (f)   Computation of Surcharge. The concentration of wastes used for
computing surcharges shall be established by waste sampling. Waste sampling
shall be performed as often as may be deemed necessary by the City or its
representatives and shall be binding as a basis for surcharges.
   (g)   Credits.
      (1)   Credit for Certain Leaks.  The Director of Finance may, when
requested in writing by the owner or consumer, reduce both the monthly
wastewater service charge and the wastewater treatment charge by an amount
equal to fifty percent of the amount of the wastewater service charge that is
in excess of the average for the lesser of the prior 12 months or from the date
service started, provided the water was not discharged into the sewer system.
Such credit may be provided only when the Director verifies that a water
service or inside plumbing line, not including fixture or fixture parts, has
broken, leaked and caused excessively high water usage to record on the owner's
or consumer's water meter.
      (2)    Credit for Swimming Pool Filling. The Director of Finance may,
when requested in writing by the owner or consumer, reduce both the monthly
wastewater service charge and the wastewater treatment charge by an amount
equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the amount of the wastewater service
charge that is in excess of the average for the lesser of the prior 12 months
or from the date service started, provided the water was not discharged into
the sewer system. Such credit may be provided only when the Director verifies
that the water was used for the filling of a swimming pool of 1,000 gallon.
Such credit shall be given only one time and for one pool per calendar year.
   (h)   Commercial Evaporation Credit. The total monthly wastewater service
charge for commercial customers situated within the City with water usage in
excess of 2,000,000 gallons of water per month based upon the quantity of water
used as measured by the water meter, shall be subject to a credit of 10% upon
the user presenting to the City evidence that at least 10% of the water usage
is evaporated and not disposed of through the municipal sanitary sewerage
system unless such usage of the Municipal sewerage system is covered by a
separate specific agreement specifying rates, terms and conditions of usage
measured on a bulk or large quantity basis.

1045.01   PURPOSES AND SCOPE.
   The purposes of this Storm Water Management Code are as follows:
   (a)   To provide for effective management and financing of a Storm Water
System within the City;
   (b)   To provide a mechanism for mitigating the damaging effects of
uncontrolled and unplanned storm water runoff;
   (c)   To improve the public health, safety and welfare by providing for the
safe and efficient capture and conveyance of storm water runoff and the
correction of storm water problems; to authorize the establishment and
implementation of a master plan for storm drainage, including design,
coordination, construction, management, operation, maintenance, inspection and
enforcement;
   (d)   To establish reasonable storm drainage service charges based on each
property's contribution of storm water runoff to the system and use and benefit
of services and facilities; and
   (e)   To encourage and facilitate urban water resources management
techniques, including detention of storm water runoff, minimization of the need
to construct storm sewers, and the enhancement of the environment.
(Ord. 03-20.  Passed 1-5-04.)
1045.02   STORM WATER CHARGE GENERALLY.
   (a)   In order to accomplish such purpose a storm drainage service charge
shall be made on each lot or parcel in the City.
   (b)   Each property's contribution to runoff shall be the primary
consideration in setting the service charge. Secondary consideration shall be
given to specific or unusual service requirements of some properties, and
special and general benefits accruing to or from properties as a result of
providing their own storm water management facilities.
   (c)   The City's storm drainage service charges shall be fair and reasonable
and bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing service and
facilities. All single family residential properties and residential properties
having no more than four dwelling units shall pay the same storm water service
charges. Charges for multi-family residential properties having more than four
dwelling units and nonresidential properties within the City shall be
calculated based on the relationship that the total impervious surface (as
defined in Section
1045.03) for such parcel bears to the average impervious surface area of
residential homes within the City as defined in Section
1045.27. In no case shall any nonresidential property have an ERU of less than
one.
   (d)   Storm water costs shall be spread throughout the City, except where
activities or facilities are clearly unusual and in excess of the normal level
of service City-wide.
   (e)   Charges for single-family residential properties and residential
properties having no more than four dwelling units shall reflect the relatively
uniform effect that single-family residential development has on runoff. Multi-
family residential properties and properties in land uses other than
residential shall pay in proportion to single-family residential properties.
The impervious area of other land uses shall be considered in calculating these
rates.
   (f)   An appeal and service charge adjustment process shall be employed to
review storm water charges when unusual circumstances exist which alter runoff
characteristics or when either service or benefit varies from a normal
condition or is of greater significance than contribution to runoff.

within the City (as defined in Section
1045.03 hereof) shall be calculated by determining the total square footage of
impervious surface on each such property and dividing this total by 4,431. In
no case shall any nonresidential property have an ERU of less than one. The
total square footage of impervious surface shall be measured by the City based
on the records of the County Recorder or Auditor, the City, or through field
examination or photogram metric analysis; provided, however, that owners of
properties which are proposed for subdivision and/or development after the date
of the adoption of this chapter shall include on all preliminary plan and final
plan drawings submitted to the City in connection with the subdivision approval
process, a certification as to the total square footage of impervious surface
to be located on the property upon its development.

all lots and parcels within the City classified as single-family residential
properties and nonresidential properties (each as defined in Section
1045.03). The City Manager, or his or her designee, is further directed to
measure the total square footage of impervious surface on all nonresidential
properties within the City and assign the appropriate number of ERUs to each
such property as is appropriate based on the measurements.
(Ord. 03-20.  Passed 1-5-04.)
1045.30   COLLECTION OF STORM DRAINAGE SERVICE CHARGE.
   (a)   The storm drainage service charge shall be paid by the owner of each
lot or parcel which is subject to this charge on a monthly basis in accordance
with regulations established herein. The City shall use its best efforts to
cause bills for the service charges to be delivered to each owner or designee
on a quarterly basis, however, the failure of the City to deliver such a bill
to owner or his or her designee shall not be cause for non-payment. The service
charge is a continuous charge for all improved properties subject to the
charge, whether occupied or vacant. The owner of the property or properties is
responsible for payment of all service charges, whether incurred under his or
her ownership or previously. Statements may be mailed to another designated
person upon the written agreement of the City and the owner, such as a tenant
or agent; however, the owner is ultimately responsible for payment.
   (b)   Bills are payable on or before the “due date” printed on the bill. Any
amount not paid by the due date shall be considered delinquent and subject to a
late payment penalty of 5% of the current charges. When a bill or part thereof
is delinquent for 30 days, a notice shall be sent to the owner advising of the
delinquency. If a bill remains delinquent for 60 days, the City shall certify
to the County Auditor all charges for storm water services which are delinquent
for payment. Such amounts, including County collection fees, shall be entered
upon the tax duplicate of the property involved and shall be a lien upon such
land from and after the date of the entry, to be collected with other taxes and
returned to the City.
(Ord. 03-20.  Passed 1-5-04.)

   (a)   Persons who consider the charges applicable to their lot or parcel to
be unjust or inequitable or who dispute the denial of permit or conditions
placed on approval of a permit with respect to work relating to a storm water
drainage facility may apply to the City Manager or his or her designee for an
adjustment or review thereof, stating in writing the grounds of the complaint.
The City Manager or the City Manager's designee shall consider the complaint
and determine whether an adjustment of the charges for any such lot or parcel
is necessary to provide for the just and equitable application of the storm
drainage service charge, and adjust such charge if appropriate, or determine
whether a complaint regarding the denial of a permit or any condition placed on
a permit approval is appropriate or should be modified.
   (b)   The City Manager or his or her designee shall have 30 days to
investigate the matter. The City Manager or the City Manager's designee shall
timely review and rule upon the appeal.
(Ord. 03-20.  Passed 1-5-04.)

1444.01   CERTIFICATES REQUIRED.
   (a)   No building hereafter erected shall be used or occupied in whole or in
part until the Chief Building Official or his or her designated representative
has issued a certificate of occupancy therefor under this chapter.
   (b)   No developer, builder, owner or occupant shall occupy or permit or
allow the occupancy of any structure hereafter built without first obtaining a
certificate of occupancy therefor.  (Ord. 76-30.  Passed 12-6-76.)
1444.02   CONDITIONS OF ISSUANCE.
   (a)   The Chief Building Official or his or her designated representative
shall not issue a certificate of occupancy until the initial improvements
contained in the Subdivision Regulations have been installed, including, but
not limited to, required curbs, gutters, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, water
facilities and base coats of asphalt or an approved hard surface on streets in
front of structures, and until the structure meets the Building Code, Zoning
Code and all other applicable specifications and requirements as contained in
these Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   
The holder of a building permit for the construction or reconstruction of a new
building wherein curb boxes and/or drive approaches are required shall be
responsible for the installation of these items.  Such installation shall be
done in accordance with the standard construction drawings of the City.  No
permanent certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the drive approach and
curb box have been installed. 
   (c)   If a permit holder requests the issuance of a temporary certificate of
occupancy prior to the completion of all items required by these Codified
Ordinances and any applicable building codes, such temporary occupancy permit
may be issued by the Chief Building Official if he or she is satisfied that
such building may be occupied safely prior to full completion of the building
without endangering health, life or the public welfare.
   If the required work is not completed by the date set forth on said
temporary certificate of occupancy, the owner shall be subject to the penalties
specified in Section
1444.99.
   (d)    If a permit holder requests the issuance of a permanent occupancy
certificate subsequent to the completion of all items required by any
applicable building codes, but prior to the completion of all items required by
the Zoning Code, such permanent occupancy certificate may be issued by the
Chief Building Official if the applicant has deposited with the City a sum, in
cash, a performance bond or an irrevocable letter of credit from a banking
institution equal to the amount necessary to complete such unfinished items, as
required by the Zoning Code.  The issuance of a permanent certificate of
occupancy and the acceptance of such sum, bond or letter of credit by the City
shall not relieve the applicant of his or her primary responsibility for
completion of such unfinished work by a date to be specified by the Chief
Building Official.  Upon completion of such unfinished items, such sum, bond or
letter of credit deposited with the City shall be refunded to the applicant. 
If the City must expend such sum, bond or letter of credit to complete any
uncompleted items of work and if, upon completion, the sum, bond or letter of
credit is not adequate to cover all expenses associated with completing such
unfinished items of work, the applicant shall be responsible to the City for
the balance of the construction cost.  (Ord. 94-18. Passed 1-3-95.)
1444.99   PENALTY.

committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or
continues.

1468.01   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Findings of Fact. The City of Vandalia has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (b)   Statement of Purpose.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and, generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)    Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (c)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (d)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Vandalia as identified in division (e) of this
section, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City of Vandalia.
   (e)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.
      (1)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
         A.   Flood Insurance Study for Montgomery County, Ohio, and
incorporated areas dated January 6, 2005. Flood Insurance Rate Map for
Montgomery County, Ohio, and incorporated areas dated January 6, 2005.
         B.   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Vandalia as required by Section 1468.04(c) "Subdivisions and
Large Scale Developments."
      (2)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Director of Public Service’s Office.
   (f)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including Subdivision Regulations,
Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (g)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (h)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these
regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (i)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 04-29. Passed 12-20-04; Ord. 16-06. Passed 5-2-16.)
1468.02   DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   "Accessory structure." A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.

   (h)   "Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)." Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)." The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   "Fill." A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   "Flood" or "flooding." A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   "Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)." Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)." An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   "Flood Insurance Risk Zones." Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   "Zone A." Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   "Zones A1-30 and Zone AE." Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   "Zone AO." Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   "Zone AH." Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   "Zone A99." Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   "Zone B and Zone X" (shaded).  Areas of 500-year flood; areas
subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   "Zone C and Zone X" (unshaded). Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   "Flood Insurance Study (FIS)." The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   "Flood Protection Elevation." The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus one foot of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the City Engineer.
   (q)   "Floodway." A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   "Freeboard." A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   "Historic structure." Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis." An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   "Letter of Map Change (LOMC)." A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
LOMC's are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   "Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)." A revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map
and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood
hazard area.
      (2)   "Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)." A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   "Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)." A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance, Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   "Lowest floor." The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   "Manufactured home." A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   "Manufactured home park." As specified in OAC  3701-27-01, a
manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three or more
manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or
for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle,
or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or
rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)." The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   "New construction." Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Vandalia Flood
Insurance Rate Map, November 4, 1981, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (aa)   "Person." Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or State community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   "Recreational vehicle." A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   "Registered professional architect." A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   "Registered professional engineer." A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   "Registered professional surveyor." A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   "Special flood hazard area." Also known as "areas of special flood
hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   "Start of construction." The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of  any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a
building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a
building.
   (hh)   "Structure." A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   "Substantial damage." Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   "Substantial improvement." Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction";
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
   (kk)   "Variance." A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   "Violation." The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
(Ord. 04-29. Passed 12-20-04.)
1468.03   ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Designation of the Flood Plain Administrator. The City Engineer is
hereby appointed to administer and implement these regulations.
   (b)   Duties and Responsibilities of the City Engineer. The duties and
responsibilities of the City Engineer shall include but are not limited to:

floodway data have not been identified, the City Engineer shall review and
reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a Federal, State,
or other source.
      (2)    Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the City Engineer.
      (3)    When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The City Engineer shall make interpretations, where needed, as to
the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood hazard. A
person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
Section
1468.05, "Appeals and Variances".
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (i)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
City Engineer shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the  need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the City Engineer may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other Federal,
State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

base lines are hereby established, National Road (U. S. Route 40) running east
and west and Dixie Drive, running north and south. All streets running east and
west shall be numbered east and west from Dixie Drive; all streets running
north and south shall be numbered north and south from National Road. The even
numbers shall be used on the south side of all east and west streets and on the
east side of all north and south streets. The odd numbers shall be used on the
north side of all east and west streets and on the west side of all north and
south streets. However, when a street curves ninety degrees or more, the
numbering on such street shall be consecutive. The base for such numbering
shall be that portion designated by Council, upon motion, carried by
affirmative vote of a majority of members present at a regular meeting,
irrespective of the numbers being on the side of the street as above indicated.
The number 100 shall be allowed for each block, providing each existing
entrance or doorway shall receive a number, and that number shall progress
arithmetically. Plats shall be made of each street numbered and shall show the
numbers given to each lot or parcel.
(Ord. 58-15. Passed 9-2-58.)
1472.03   SPECIFICATIONS FOR NUMBERS.
   Upon notification by the Director of Public Service of the proper number for
a house or building, the owner of such house or building shall cause such
number to be placed on the front of the house or building. If a house or
building stands back more than fifty feet from the street line, the numbers
shall be displayed conspicuously at or near the walk or driveway in an
appropriate place so as to be easily legible from the sidewalk. Such numbers
shall not be less than three inches in height.  (Ord. 58-15. Passed 9-2-58.)
1472.04   CHANGES; AUTHORITY.
   The Director of Public Service is authorized to change the house numbering
of any street or part of a street or of any individual buildings when such
change is necessary by reason of readjustment of any kind, inaccuracy or
mistake, or for any other cause.
(Ord. 58-15. Passed 9-2-58.)
1472.05   REMOVlNG OR DEFACING NUMBERS.
   No person shall remove, alter or deface any house number properly assigned
and placed on or near a house or building, or place or retain on any house or
building any number other than the one duly assigned. (Ord. 58-15. Passed 9-2-
58.)
1472.99   PENALTY.
   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed

organization responsible for such maintenance. The easement(s) should also
grant to the City the right to maintain and assess all costs to the responsible
parties in the event such maintenance is not properly performed.
      (4)   In designing storm water detention and retention facilities, water
quality benefits shall be considered to the maximum extent practicable.
   (d)   Stream and Wetland Riparian Buffers. The site owner and/or applicant
shall leave an undisturbed riparian buffer on both sides of and/or surrounding
water resources, except for crossings and other riparian area and wetland
impacts approved by the City Engineer. Buffer width will be determined on a
case by case basis using criteria such as floodplain, topography, vegetative
cover, canopy cover, and soil types, etc.
   (e)   Channel Protection. To protect stream channels from degradation, a
specific channel protection criterion shall be provided as prescribed in the
latest edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
   (f)   Temporary Stabilization of Disturbed Areas and Soil Stockpiles.
      (1)   Soil stabilization shall be initiated on disturbed areas as
specified in Table 1 below.
   Table 1: Temporary Stabilization
 
Area Requiring Temporary Stabilization Time Frame to Apply Erosion Controls
Any disturbed area within 50 feet of a Within two days of the most recent
stream and not at final grade.         disturbance if that area will remain
                                       idle for more than 21 days.
For all construction activities, any
disturbed area, including soil         Within seven days of the most recent
stockpiles, that will be dormant for   disturbance within that area.
more than 21 days, and not within 50
feet of a stream.
Disturbed areas that will be idle over Prior to onset of winter weather.
winter.
 
      (2)   Application practices include vegetative establishment, mulching,
wood chips, matting, erosion blankets and the early application of gravel base
on areas to be paved. Soil stabilization measures should be appropriate for the
time of year, site conditions and estimated time of use.
      (3)   Topsoil removed shall be stored on site and shall be stabilized
with quick growing plants or other means, so that it is protected from wind and
water erosion. Topsoil shall be maintained in a usable condition for sustaining
vegetation and reused on the site.
   (g)   Permanent Stabilization.
      (1)   A permanent vegetative cover shall be initiated on disturbed areas
as specified in Table 2 below.
   Table 2: Permanent Stabilization
 
Area Requiring Permanent Stabilization  Time Frame to Apply Erosion Controls
Any area that will lie dormant for 12   Within seven days of the most recent
months or more.                         disturbance.
Any area at final grade.                Within seven days of reaching final

Any area within 50 feet of a stream and Within two days of reaching final
at final grade.                         grade.
 
      (2)   Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until a
ground cover is achieved which is mature enough to control soil erosion and
will survive severe weather conditions.
   (h)   Cut and Fill Slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed,
constructed and stabilized in a manner which will minimize erosion.
Consideration should be given to the length and steepness of the slope, the
soil type, upslope drainage area, groundwater conditions, and other applicable
factors. If, after final grading, excessive erosion takes place, additional
slope stabilizing measures by the owner, developer, or builder will be required
until the problem is corrected. The following guidelines are provided to aid in
developing an adequate design.
      (1)   Roughened soil surfaces are generally preferred to smooth surfaces
on slopes.
      (2)   Diversions should be constructed at the top of long steep slopes
which have significant drainage areas above the slope. Diversions or terraces
may also be used to reduce slope length.
      (3)   Concentrated storm water should not be allowed to flow down cut or
fill slopes unless contained within an adequate channel, flume, or slope drain
structure.
      (4)   Wherever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane which endangers
the stability of the slope, adequate drainage or other protection should be
provided.
   (i)   Protection of Adjacent Properties/Public Right-of-Ways. Properties,
public right-of-ways, and thoroughfares adjacent to the site of an earth-
disturbing activity shall be protected from sediment deposition. This may be
accomplished by preserving a well-vegetated buffer at the perimeter of the
site, by installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers, filters, silt
fences, dikes, sediment basins, or by a combination of such measures. Gravel
parking and maneuvering areas will be provided for vehicles which must enter
and leave the construction site. All streets will be protected whether final
acceptance for the street has been granted or not. Streets adjacent to
construction activities shall be adequately swept before 4:00 p.m. on a work
day.
   (j)   Sediment Control Structures.
      (1)   Sediment control structures shall be used to trap sediment on a
site remaining disturbed for more than fourteen days. Such structures may
include, but are not limited to, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection,
sediment basins and diversions or channels which direct runoff to a sediment
basin. All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.
      (2)    Sediment control structures shall be constructed as a first step
in grading and be made functional before upslope earth disturbing activities
take place. Earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and diversions shall be
seeded and mulched as soon as the installation is complete. Sediment control
structures shall be functional throughout the course of earth disturbing
activity and until the site is stabilized with permanent vegetation. Settling
basins for watersheds of less than five acres shall include a storage zone of
at least 1,000 cubic feet per contributory acre and a dewatering zone comprised
of at least 67 cubic yards per acre. The dewatering zone shall be no more than
five feet deep and have a drawdown time of at least 48 hours. Once the
watershed is fully reclaimed, ponds shall be converted to detention facilities
as applicable.
      (3)   Sheet flow runoff from the site shall be intercepted by silt fence
or diversions. Silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and shall be
capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The relationship between the maximum
drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in Table 3
below.
   Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
 
Maximum Drainage Area (in acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a Particular
Linear Feet of Silt Fence               Drainage Area (percent)
   0.5                                  <2%
   0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
   0.125                                > 20% but < 50%
 
      (4)   Storm water diversion devices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes.
      (5)   Whenever storm water detention is required the storm water runoff
from the site shall pass through a sediment basin or other suitable sediment
trapping facility before discharge to a receiving water body. The City Engineer
may require sediment basins or traps for smaller disturbed areas where deemed
necessary.
   (k)   Stabilization of Waterways and Outlets. All on-site storm water
conveyance channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow without erosion. Methods adequate to prevent erosion shall
also be provided at the outlets of all pipes and paved channels.
   (l)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection. All storm sewer inlets shall be
protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter the conveyance system
without first being filtered or otherwise treated to reduce sediment loading.
   (m)   Working In or Crossing Watercourses.
      (1)   All activities shall be kept out of watercourses to the extent
possible. Where in-channel work is necessary, precautions shall be taken to
stabilize the work area during construction to minimize erosion. The channel
(including bed and banks) shall be restored to its original cross-section and
all disturbed area stabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed.
      (2)   Where a watercourse will be crossed regularly during construction,
a temporary stream crossing shall be provided, used for the shortest period
practical, removed following site construction, and restored as described in
division (m)(1) of this section.
   (n)   Maintenance and Removal of Temporary Measures.
      (1)   All temporary erosion and sediment control practices shall be
maintained and repaired to assure continued performance.
      (2)   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be
removed within thirty  days after final site stabilization is achieved or after
the temporary measures are no longer needed. Trapped sediment and other
disturbed soil areas resulting from the removal of temporary measures shall
have the final grade established and be permanently stabilized to prevent
further erosion and sedimentation.
   (o)   Control of Construction Site Debris and Wastes. All owners,
applicants, contractors, and developers shall control wastes such as discarded
building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter, and sanitary
waste on construction sites and shall keep streets and gutters clear of all
sediment and debris from the site.
   (p)   Use, Safety, and Maintenance of Storm Water Practices.
      (1)   Storm water management practices shall be designed for the ultimate
use of the site and function safely and with minimal maintenance.
      (2)   If an inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of
repair or maintenance, with the exception of a sediment settling pond, it must
be repaired or maintained within three days of the inspection. Sediment
settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten days of the
inspection.

restrict certain storm water practices.
   (h)   Supplemental Requirements.
      (1)   Determination of post-development runoff.
         A.   Each SMP shall include an evaluation of pre-development
conditions together with during, and post-development impacts that quantifies
the volume and rate of runoff from the site by subdrainage areas. This
evaluation shall be prepared according to methods prescribed in the latest
edition of Rainwater and Land Development or other appropriate sources. The
evaluation shall:
            1.   Show delineation and sequence of subdrainage units which
comprise the area proposed for development.
            2.   Indicate the hydraulic length of slope per individual
subdrainage unit and the length of the natural or manmade watercourse which
accommodates the surface runoff from each subdrainage unit.
            3.   Indicate within the legend the average percent slope, erosion
factor (K) and runoff curve number (CN) per individual subdrainage unit for a
24-hour storm of a one-year frequency.
            4.   Include a hydrograph for a 24-hour storm of the critical
frequency to be controlled as determined according to division (h)(1)C. of this
section and all calculations made pertinent to evaluating the effects of the
proposed development on the pre-development runoff conditions of the site.
         B.   Calculations for the design of storm water management facilities
shall demonstrate the following for each subdrainage unit:
            1.   The peak rate of runoff from the developed watershed with
respect to the Critical Storm and all more frequent storms occurring on the
site does not exceed the peak rate of runoff from a one (1) year frequency,
twenty-four (24) hour storm occurring on the same site under pre-development
conditions.
            2.   Storms of less frequent occurrence than the critical storm, up
to the 100- year storm shall have its peak runoff rates no greater than the
peak runoff rates from equivalent storms under pre-development conditions.
Consideration of the 1-, 2- , 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year storms in design
and construction will be considered meeting this standard.
         C.   Calculation of a critical storm for each watershed having an
offsite outfall shall be determined as follows:
            1.   Calculate by appropriate hydrologic methods, such as the SCS
Technical Release 55 (Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, Technical Release
55, 1986, Natural Resources Conservation Service) or other method approved by
the City Engineer (rational method is not acceptable), the total volume of
runoff from a one-year frequency, 24-hour storm occurring on the development
area before, and after development. The Vandalia City Engineer shall approve or
reject any calculation method based on its technical validity for the given
situation.
            2.   From the volumes determined in division (h)C.1. of this
section, determine the percentage increase in volume of runoff due to the
proposed development, and using this percentage, select the 24-hour critical
storm from this table:
   If the percentage of increase in volume of runoff is (see chart below):
 
% Equal to or Greater Than % Less Than The Critical Storm for Peak Rate Control
   --                      10       1 year
   10                      20       2 years
   20                      50       5 years
   50                      100      10 years
   100                     250      25 years
   250                     500      50 years
   500                     --       100 years
 
      (2)   Off-site storm water control facilities.
         A.   Exceptions to requiring permanent on-site runoff control on the
site may be considered by the City provided the applicant can prove to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer that:
            1.   The intent and standards of this chapter for runoff control
can be best achieved by the utilization of off-site storm water control
facilities.
            2.   Runoff from the site can be conveyed to off-site storm water
facilities in a manner and by means which satisfies or surpasses the standards
of this chapter.
            3.   The applicant has ownership of or the right to use the off-
site facility in question and applicable construction and maintenance easements
are acquired and recorded.
      (3)   Pond design standards. Where sedimentation and/or runoff are to be
controlled utilizing a pond, the following standards shall be observed.
         A.   Earthen embankment fill material shall be clay. The embankment
shall be keyed into the surrounding banks and channel bottom to a minimum depth
of eighteen inches.
         B.   Open channel emergency spillways shall be cut into original
material and not allowed in embankment fill.
         C.   Design shall include the removal of all trees within the
impoundment area.
         D.   Paved flow channels in detention ponds shall be provided between
inlet and outlet pipes. The minimum slope from the outlet pipe to any point in
the pond shall be 1%.  Alternatively, underdrains could also be utilized to
assure drainage and allow mowing and other maintenance activities. In ponds for
large developments which include forebays and micropools, flow channels are not
required. Underdrains in this case, however, are strongly encouraged unless
physical site limitations prohibit them.
      (4)   As-built certification. Prior to release of the performance bond, a
registered surveyor shall certify that the pond has been constructed to achieve
design volumes at critical depths as dictated by the design calculations and to
the satisfaction of the City Engineer.

   (d)   Salvage Materials. When any structure has been ordered razed and
removed, the governing body or other designated officer under said contract or

   (j)   Storage of Junk, Disabled Vehicles and Rubbish on Premises.  No person
shall deposit, store, maintain or collect junk, a disabled motor vehicle and/or
rubbish outside of a building within the limits of the City.  Such acts are
hereby declared to be a public nuisance and offensive to the public health,
welfare and safety of the people of the City.  The provisions of this
subsection shall not apply to the deposit, storage, maintenance or collection
of junk, disabled motor vehicles and/or rubbish in an enclosed building, or in
any area of the City in which the same is permitted by City ordinances.
      (1)   Definitions.  As used in this subsection, the following words shall
have the meanings set forth herein:
         A.   Junk: Any worn out, cast off or discarded article or material
which is ready for destruction or has been collected or stored for salvage or
conversion to some other use, and shall include but not be limited to
apparently inoperable appliances and electronics, broken furniture and
mattresses.  Any article of material which, unaltered or unchanged and without
further reconditioning, can be used for its original purpose as readily as when
new shall not be considered junk.  Council has determined that junk on property
constitutes a public nuisance because it harbors rodents, vermin, and other
pests; attracts children to enter upon the property; and diminishes neighboring
property values.
         B.   Disabled motor vehicle: Any motor vehicle that meets all of the
following criteria: (1) Three model years old, or older; (2) Apparently
inoperable; (3) Extensively damaged, including, but not limited to, any of the
following: missing wheels, tires, engine, or transmission.  Portions of
disabled motor vehicles, including, but not limited to, hoods, fenders,
radiators, rims or motor parts not being utilized for the repair of a motor
vehicle shall be considered junk.  Council has determined that disabled motor
vehicles are a public nuisance because: they harbor rodents, vermin, and other
pests; they contain toxic substances and flammable liquids and fumes; they
attract children to enter; they serve as temporary abode for derelicts,
vagrants and criminals; they diminish neighboring property values; and they are
likely to be damaged by vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
         C.   Rubbish: Includes wire, chips, shavings, bottles, broken glass,
crockery, tin, cast or woodenware, hoses, rags, dead weeds, stumps, tree
trunks, brush, paper circulars, handbills, boots, shoes, ashes, metal,
discarded parts and equipment or any waste material other than garbage or
offal.  Council has determined that rubbish on property constitutes a public
nuisance because it harbors rodents, vermin, and other pests; poses potential
health hazards; and diminishes neighboring property values.
      (2)   Notice to remove.  The owner, occupant or person having charge or
management of any lot or parcel of land situated within the City, whether
improved or unimproved, vacant or occupied, shall, within the time set forth in
the notice, which shall not be less than ten days of service of the notice for
junk or rubbish, or less than fourteen days for disabled vehicles, remove or
cause to be removed any junk, disabled motor vehicle and/or rubbish found upon
any such lot or parcel of land. Notice shall be served as provided in Section
1482.23.
      (3)   Noncompliance.  If the owner, occupant or person having charge or
management of any lot or parcel of land does not remove or cause to be removed
such junk, disabled motor vehicle and/or rubbish in accordance with the
provisions of this subsection, then after the applicable appeal period, the
Code Official or his or her designee is hereby authorized to enter upon the
property in order to enforce the provisions of this subsection and to cause
such junk, disabled motor vehicle and/or rubbish to be removed.
      (4)   Remedy of City.  Any and all expenses or costs, relating to abating
any nuisance under this section shall be paid by the owner of such property
except when such expenses or costs are incurred with respect to a government or
school building owned by a governmental entity or political subdivision and are
funded by Federal money.  Such costs shall include the cost of abatement and
include but not be limited to reasonable attorney’s fees, costs of inspection,
administrative staff and support staff, court costs, title search fees, process
server fees, and costs of collection or prosecution, including discovery and
deposition expenses.  The bill shall be mailed to the owner’s last known
address.  If a bill is not paid within thirty days, or if the name or address
of the owner is not known, the Code Official may make a written return to the
County Auditor of the action under this chapter, including a statement of the
costs of the abatement services and a description of the property sufficient to
allow the costs to become a lien on the property.  If the Code Official makes a
return to the County Auditors, then the lien on the property shall be collected
in the same manner as other taxes and returned to the City general fund in
accordance with Ohio R.C. Chapter 731.  The collection of expenses of removal
by the City shall not be a bar to a prosecution for a violation of this section
or to imposition of the penalty provided in paragraph (j)(5) hereof.
      (5)   Penalty.  Whoever violates this subsection is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree and shall be fined not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned not more than sixty days, or both, for each
offense.  A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation occurs or continues.
      (6)   Emergency Situation.  If the nuisance presents an imminent threat
to public health, immediately abate the nuisance without notice, and bill the
owner for the costs of any abatement.

any accessory structures, if prior to the expiration of the thirty-day period,
the owner request such extension in writing and shows reasonable cause for the
requested extension the Code Official may grant an extension to the demolition
permit.  If a demolition permit is issued, the hearing shall be tabled during
such thirty-day period. If such demolition permit is issued, at the scheduled
hearing for nuisance and abatement, the City shall cause the hearing to be
tabled during such thirty-day period as may be extended.
   (c)   On being served the hearing notice, the owner may within fifteen days
after service of notice, request a continuance of the hearing not to exceed
fourteen days.
   (d)   Any abatement by the owner upon the issuance of a building permit
under division (a) of this section or a demolition permit under division (b) of
this section, shall be complete within the time prescribed in the applicable
section above.
(Ord. 19-27.  Passed 12-2-19.)
1484.06  HEARING.
   (a)   The hearing as set forth in the hearing notice shall be conducted
before the Vandalia Property Maintenance Board. All hearings shall be open to
the public.  The owner, the owner's representative, the Code Official, and any
person whose interests are affected shall be given an opportunity to be heard. 
The Code Official shall present its evidence of nuisance and need for abatement
first. The owner/owner's representative/person with affected interest may then
present evidence, provide witnesses and testimony, and cross exam witnesses.
The Code Official and/or owner may be represented by legal counsel. The
procedures shall not require compliance with strict rules of evidence, but
shall mandate that only relevant information be received. The Property
Maintenance Board/City Manager may issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance from the person requesting such subpoena.
   (b)   At such hearing:
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations, but including all documents presented and a
verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (4)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
   (c)   (1)   The Property Maintenance Board shall determine if the Code
Official misinterpreted or misapplied this Code or the basis for a bill for
correction or abatement and shall separately determine by majority vote:  (i)
if the Code Official is correct in declaring a public nuisance as defined in
Section 1484.02 exists; and  (ii) if  the public nuisance is found to exist,
whether the proposed abatement set forth in the hearing notice is reasonable
and necessary.
      (2)   If a proposed abatement is the demolition of a building, such
abatement shall only be approved by the Board upon expressly finding that no
other abatement method will reasonably effectuate the removal of the public
nuisance.
      (3)   The Property Maintenance Board may find on its own accord, based on
the evidence, that a public nuisance as defined in Section 1484.02 that was not
identified by the Code Official exists on the property.
   (d)   The Property Maintenance Board may continue the matter for a period
not to exceed forty-five days for further investigation and disposition. In the
event there is not a quorum at the Property Maintenance Board hearing the
hearing shall be continued for a period not to exceed forty-five days.
   (e)   A decision by the Property Maintenance Board must have a concurring
vote of at least three members.
   (f)   The decision of the Property Maintenance Board may be announced at the
conclusion of the hearing and thereafter issued in writing, or the decision may
be issued later in writing but no later than ten business days after the
hearing. A copy of the written decision signed by the Chair or Vice Chair of
the Property Maintenance Board shall be mailed, with certificate of mailing, to
the last known address of the owner, or person representing the owner. It shall
be the responsibility of the owner, or person representing the owner, to keep
the Code Official apprised of his/her current mailing address.
   (g)   Within fifteen days after the issuance of the written decision by the
Property Maintenance Board, the owner may apply in writing to the Code Official
and Chief Building Official for a building permit or demolition permit as
provided in Section
1484.05.
   (h)   For the purpose of appeal pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506, the final
order shall be deemed to have been entered on the date on which the copy of the
decision was mailed.
(Ord. 19-27.  Passed 12-2-19.)
1484.07  ACTION BY CITY AFTER HEARING OF PROPERTY MAINTENANCE BOARD.
   (a)   Should the Property Maintenance Board conclude that a public nuisance
exists and that abatement is necessary, the Property Maintenance Board shall
grant the Code Official authority to enter on the premises and abate the
nuisance.  In abating such nuisance, the Code Official may call on any
department, division, or bureau of the City for whatever assistance may be
necessary to abate such public nuisance as aforesaid, or may, by private
contract, abate or lessen the severity of such public nuisance or take such
other action as may be deemed appropriate, and the cost of the contract will be
paid for from City funds authorized to be used for that purpose and thereafter
charged to the owner. No abatement action by the Code Official shall take place
until at least thirty-five after the decision of the Property Maintenance
Board.
   (b)   If the owner of a premises requests a permit as provided for in
Section
1484.06(h) but fails to fully abate the nuisance within ninety days for a
building permit or thirty days for a demolition permit, the Code Official may
abate the nuisance as provided by the Property Maintenance Board as provided in
division (a) of this section.
   (c)   A structure may be razed and removed, either through an available
public agency or by contract or arrangement with private persons.
   (d)   When any structure has been ordered razed and removed, the governing
body or other designated officer under said contract or arrangement aforesaid
shall have the right to sell the salvage and valuable materials at the highest
price obtainable. The net proceeds of such sale, after deducting the expenses
of such razing and removal, shall be promptly remitted to the property owner
with a report of such sale or transaction, including the items of expense and
the amounts deducted. If such a surplus does not remain to be turned over, the
report shall so state.
(Ord. 19-27.  Passed 12-2-19.)
1484.08  ASSESSMENT OF COST.
   (a)   The cost of abating or lessening the severity of a public nuisance
shall be billed directly to the owner and sent by certified mail. The bill for
the cost thereof shall be paid within sixty days after receipt of the bill. A
notice of the assessment may be recorded with the County Record.
   (b)   If the costs are not so recovered, the City may collect the costs by
any of the following methods:
      (1)   The City may cause the costs of abating or lessening the severity
of such public nuisance to be levied as an assessment and recovered in
accordance with R.C. § 715.261.
      (2)   The City may commence a civil action to recover the costs from the
owner, as provided in R.C. § 715.261.
         (Ord. 19-27.  Passed 12-2-19.)

or let by another for occupancy any structure that has been declared by the
Code Official to be a public nuisance without first applying for and obtaining
the written consent of the Code Official.
   (b)   No owner or other person shall enter or be present in or on any
building or premises that has been posted with a notice identifying the said
building or premises to be a public nuisance, without first obtaining
authorization in writing from the Code Official and having such written
authorization on his/her person at the time. The officers, agents and employees
of the city, state or federal government, or any political subdivision, or of
any public utility, shall be exempt from the requirements of this section while
in the course of their employment.
   (c)   Written authorization, as provided in division (a) and (b) of this
section, shall be issued by the Code Official to any person who provides
documentation which, on its face, indicates that such person is either an owner
of the premises or is authorized by the owner to be present, or to any person
who makes application and pays for any permit to do work on the premises.
   (d)   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any premises, who has received a
written notice declaring such premises to be a public nuisance to sell,
transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of such premises to another until the
premises have been rehabilitated or demolished, and until any injunctions
obtained against use or occupancy have been dissolved, or until the owner has
first furnished the grantee, transferee, or lessee a true copy of the said
notice, and has furnished to the Code Official a signed and notarized statement
from the grantee, transferee, or lessee, acknowledging the receipt of such
notice and accepting the responsibility for abating the nuisance by
rehabilitation, demolition, or otherwise in conformity with the terms of such
notice, or extension thereof granted by the Code Official.
   (e)   No person shall fail or refuse to comply with a final order to abate a
public nuisance, as provided herein.
   (f)   A violation of division (a), (b), or (d) of this section shall be a
misdemeanor of the third degree. A violation of division (b) or (d) of this
section shall be construed to be a strict liability offense. A violation of
division (a) of this section shall be construed to be a strict liability
offense as to all owners or persons responsible for the nuisance. Negligence,
as defined in R.C. § 130.08, shall be the standard of culpability as to all
other persons who violate division (a) of this section.

(7) Abandonment of Towers All providers utilizing towers shall present a report to the Director of Public Services supplying notification regarding the discontinuation of any tower facility and the date this use will cease. Such report shall be filed at least thirty days prior to the cessation date. If at any time the use of the facility is discontinued for 180-days, the Administrative Officer may declare the facility abandoned. The 180-day period excludes any dormancy period between construction and the initial use of the facility. The owner/operator of the facility will receive written notice from the Administrative Officer and be instructed to either reactivate use of the facility within 180 days, or dismantle and remove the facility. If reactivation or dismantling does not occur, the City of Vandalia will both remove the facility or contract to have the facility removed and assess the owner/operator the costs. The City of Vandalia must provide the tower owner thirty-day notice and an opportunity to be heard before the Board of Zoning Appeals before initiating such action. After such notice has been provided, the City of Vandalia shall have the authority to initiate proceedings to either acquire the tower and any appurtenances attached thereto at the current fair market value at that time, or, in the alternative, order the demolition of the tower and all appurtenances. The City of Vandalia shall provide the tower owner with the right to a public hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals, which public hearing shall follow the thirty-day notice required in subsection (B) hereof.

Section 1218.04: Use-Specific Standards
City of Vandalia, Ohio - Planning and Zoning Code 52
January 17, 2019
It is not the intent of this section to limit or restrict the content of communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults to materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. The standards in this chapter are intended to ensure that residential districts, religious uses, educational uses, parks, and other areas where large numbers of minors regularly travel or congregate are located in areas free from the adverse secondary effects of adult uses. The location of residential districts, religious uses, educational uses, parks and other areas where large numbers of minors regularly travel or congregate within viable, unblighted and desirable areas supports the preservation of property values and promotes the health, safety and welfare of the public. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on a community in reports and studies made available to the Council including, but not limited to, St. Paul, Minnesota; Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and on findings incorporated in cases decided by the United States Supreme Court, other Federal courts and Ohio courts, City Council finds: that the enactment of this section to regulate the adult uses is a substantial government interest for the City in preserving the quality of urban life, and that it is in the interest of the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City that adult uses are regulated pursuant to the standards herein.
(2) Use Regulations
For purposes of this section, all distances shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures, from the closest boundary of the property on which the adult use facility is located to the closest boundary of the property on which the facility or residence of use as listed in this section is located. The presence of a political subdivision boundary shall be irrelevant for purposes of calculating and applying the distance requirements of this section. Adult uses shall be subject to the following standards in addition to the general conditional use review criteria established in this code: No adult use shall be established within 1,000 feet of a zoning district where residential dwellings are a permitted use.

(f) Determination of the Total Maximum Daily Inventory (TMDI)
(1) The purpose of the TMDI is to quantify and memorialize the non-conformity of a Zoning Lot for the handling of regulated substances. The City of Dayton first adopted the well Head Operation District and the Well Field Protection Overlay District restricting the use of regulated substances on September 6, 2011. The Administrative Officer, upon the recommendation of the Combined Health District technical staff, determined the TMDI of lots within the Well SWPO District based on uses of the lots at the time that the districts were adopted, analysis of RSAIRs, and inspection of the properties. Now, with the passage of the amendments to this section, the boundaries and the name of the districts are changed. This change will require Public Health – Dayton & Montgomery County (PHDMC—formerly known as the Combined Health District) technical staff to analyze and make a recommendation as to the TMDI of properties that are now in the Source Water Protection Area, but that were not in the Well Field Protection Districts. All of the lots located in the SWPO District that were nonconforming with respect to the amount of regulated substances have been assigned a TMDI. The remaining lots were deemed conforming and have a TMDI of 160 pounds.
(2) The lots that were a part the SWPO District and continue to be a part of the Source Water Protection Area shall have the same TMDI as they last had in the Well Field Protection Districts, subject to further reduction based upon discontinuance of use or risk point buy downs by the Source Water Protection Fund Board.
(3) For those lots that are now in the Source Water Protection Area and that were not in the Well Field Protection Districts, the Administrative Officer, upon the recommendation of PHDMC technical staff, shall determine the TMDI of the lot based upon the uses of the lot at the time it became part of the Source Water Protection Area, analysis of the RSAIRs, and inspection of the lot.
(4) The TMDI established for properties located in the Well Field Protection Districts and that are also located in the Source Water Protection Area shall remain in effect, subject to further reduction based upon discontinuance of use or Risk Point Buy Downs by the Source Water Protection Fund Board.
(5) Once the TMDI is established for a lot, it shall not be exceeded, except as may be allowed through an approved variance in Section 1214.11.
(6) Lots with dwellings, single-family or two-family dwellings shall have a TMDI of 160 pounds.
(g) Facility Hazard Potential Rating (FHPR)
(1) The purpose of the FHPR is to quantify the risk for potential groundwater contamination for the regulated substances that comprise the TMDI for a lot. While the TMDI limits the amount of regulated substances that can be handled on a lot at one time, the FHPR limits the type of regulated substances that a lot can handle. The Administrative Officer, upon the recommendation of the PHDMC technical staff, determined the FHPR for a lot by deciding the appropriate chemical class a range of hazard potential ratings for each regulated substance stored on the lot. Then, a weighted average of all of the hazard potential ratings was performed to determine the FHPR for each lot. The FHPR was only assigned to a lot that exceeded the 160-pound conforming use. Conforming use properties were not assigned an FHPR. Now, with the passage of the amendments to this section, the boundaries and the name of the districts are changed. This change will require the PHDMC technical staff to analyze and make a recommendation as to the FHPR of the properties that are now in the Source Water Protection Area, but that were not in the Well Field Protection Districts.

(2) The lots that were a part of the Well Field Protection Districts and continue to be a part of the Source Water Protection Area shall have the same FHPR as they last had in the Well Field Protection Districts. subject to further reduction based upon discontinuance of use or risk point buy downs by the Source Water Protection Fund Board.
(3) For those lots that are now in the Source Water Protection Area and that were not in the Well Field Protection Districts, the Administrative Officer. upon the recommendation of the PHDMC technical staff, shall determine the FHPR of the lot based upon the type and quantity of regulated substances lawfully handled on the zoning lot at the time it became part of the Source Water Protection Area, analysis of the RSAIRs, and inspection of the lot. The PHDMC technical staff, subject to approval from City Council, shall adopt rules and regulations for the determination of the FHPR of these properties.
(4) Once the FHPR is established for a lot, it shall not be exceeded.
(h) Hazard Potential Ranking System
(1) Table 1220-1 lists the hazard potential reflecting the overall threat and potential adverse impacts to groundwater presented by the chemical activity, regulated substances, and uses on a lot is ranked on a scale of one to nine, with one representing the lowest threat and nine representing the highest threat.

1220.03 Miller/Benchwood Design Overlay District (MBO)
(a) Purpose
The Miller/Benchwood Design Overlay District (MBO) is established to provide guidelines and regulations to ensure that the site design, physical function, and appearance of the Miller Lane and Benchwood Road area properties reinforce the Comprehensive Plan and the Miller Lane and Benchwood Road Redevelopment Area Master Plan's visions and goals.
(b) Application
These guidelines and regulations shall apply to all properties located within the MBO District as identified on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Vandalia. The guidelines and regulations shall be applied as follows:
(1) Development or redevelopment which occurs within this overlay district that is not part of an approved PUD shall conform to all of the standards in Section 1220.03(d), as mandatory requirements, where applicable.
(2) The Planning Commission and City Council should use the regulations of Section 1220.03(d), as guidelines for the approval of any plans related to the PUD.
(c) Development Review in the MBO

For corner lots the locations of the driveways shall be set back a minimum of fifty feet from the face of curb of the intersecting street or as approved by the Director of Public Services. If a driveway is not shared between parcels, the minimum setback from a property line should be twenty feet. As properties develop, they shall provide for cross easement access to adjoining properties and the consolidation of curb cuts upon development or redevelopment. Drive aisles shall be planned so as to provide continuity with adjacent properties.

Section 1220.03: Miller/Benchwood Design Overlay District (MBO)
City of Vandalia, Ohio - Planning and Zoning Code 74
January 17, 2019
Primary entrances to any developments that are greater than 100,000 square feet in floor area under one roof, including multi-tenant uses, shall include a boulevard style entrance to separate ingress and egress traffic or extended continuous landscaped islands, on either side of the driveway, extending into the parking field fifteen feet in width, to promote green space. See Figure 1220-A.
Figure 1220-A: Illustration of a boulevard entry for a large development.
(5) Building Design Standards Facade colors shall not include metallic, black or fluorescent colors. Building trim may include brighter colors than the facade colors. Building or structures shall be physically separated from any off-street parking area by a full depth, vertical barrier curb per City engineering standards, and planted areas. Sidewalks should be installed to provide safe pedestrian access to and from the building. The predominant exterior building material (greater than 60 percent) shall be brick, wood, natural stone, smoked or non-reflective glass, tinted/textured concrete masonry units or similar material. Vinyl or metal cladding is not allowed with the exception of minor trim. Smooth face concrete block may only be used for buildings greater than 20,000 square feet in floor area for no more than 20 percent of the cladding in areas not visible to the public.

Section 1220.03: Miller/Benchwood Design Overlay District (MBO)
City of Vandalia, Ohio - Planning and Zoning Code 75
January 17, 2019
For single-tenant buildings, free-standing signage shall not exceed eight feet in height and 42 square feet per face for lots with 150 feet of frontage or less. The sign area can increase by one square foot for every 2.5 feet of lot frontage in excess of 150 feet. The maximum size of a sign however, shall be 84 square feet per side. The base and frame of monument signs shall be constructed of brick or stone, or materials with colors which match the principal building. Where multiple tenants are located in one building, one free-standing sign shall be permitted to identify all tenants. Such free-standing sign shall not exceed 15 feet in height and shall conform to the sign area permitted in Chapter 1236: Sign Standards for each base zoning district. The base and frame of monument signs shall be constructed of brick, or stone, or materials with colors which match the principal building. Multiple tenants on one parcel shall share one free-standing sign at a maximum height of 15 feet. Highway identification signage shall be commonly located at a north and south location in the redevelopment area to minimize visual impact of excessive signage and to provide continuity to the design of the site. Developers desiring highway identification signage, in Subareas "A", "B" and "C" shall co-locate on these offsite signs. Private on-site tower highway signs as found north of the planning area along Miller Lane are discouraged. However, the Planning Commission may recommend to City Council approval for signs in excess of the standards of Chapter 1236: Sign Standards within Subarea "A" of the Miller Lane and Benchwood Road Redevelopment Area Plan, but only as part of a PUD approval process. This waiver of standards shall only be granted when the development is deemed by the City as substantially contributing to the economic vitality and diversity of the planning area. The size of the sign shall be reviewed during the PUD process. Wall signs shall be limited to 30 percent of the wall area facing a street and not exceed 75 square feet per frontage. For double frontage lots, both frontages shall be counted when a private tower sign is not approved. For the purposes of this overlay zone, lots adjoining interstate right-of-way may be considered frontage. The size of the wall sign may be increased by 33 percent if no freestanding sign is constructed.
(7) Parking No more than 60 percent of all required off-street parking should be located between the front facade of the primary building and the right-of-way unless additional interior landscaping is incorporated into the parking lot beyond the standards of Section 1232.05(b), and as approved by the Planning Commission as part of the site plan review. No parking should be located in the rear of any commercial use unless a safe pedestrian access into the structure is provided. See also Section 1234.08.
(8) Landscaping and Screening Mulch beds without plant material shall not be acceptable. Furthermore, mulch shall not extend more than two feet beyond the plant material.

Landscaping located continuously around the perimeter of off-street parking areas shall be installed, with the exception of access drives and areas where cross easements or cross access between properties occurs. Such landscaped area shall be a minimum of eight feet in width with one tree provided for every 25 to 30 feet plus one shrub for every three feet. Such landscaping shall be arranged in attractive groups. All other areas should be planted with grass or other suitable groundcover and maintained in a healthy condition, free of weeds, trash and other debris. Earth mounding shall be incorporated in the perimeter landscape areas surrounding parking lots to enhance the ability of the landscaped area in the visual buffering of a parking lot from adjoining right-of-way and residentially zoned property. A minimum of 51 percent of the perimeter landscaping shall be visually buffered. The visual buffer shall extend for a height of three feet from the finished grade of the parking lot and shall be constructed with the use of plant material and earth mounding, as required. The visual buffer shall have an average opacity of 80 percent.

The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is to provide a means for encouraging ingenuity, imagination and flexibility in the planning and designing of development that would not otherwise be possible with the strict application of this code under a base zoning district. The PUD is designed to allow land planning that responds to the unique characteristics of the site and its surroundings while better fulfilling the needs of both the community and applicant than conventional zoning and subdivision standards permit. PUDs will accomplish this by allowing and encouraging:
(a) Flexibility in design and location of structures;
(b) A mixture of types of structures and uses on a single development site;
(c) An effective use of land to facilitate the more efficient arrangement of buildings, traffic circulation systems and utilities;
(d) A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography, geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation and which prevents the disruption of natural drainage patterns;
(e) A more usable and suitably located area for recreation facilities, open space and other public and common facilities than would otherwise be provided under conventional land development regulations;
(f) A development pattern in harmony with surrounding land use and community development objectives outlined in the comprehensive plan;
(g) A harmonious design amongst the various elements and uses within the development while mitigating any potential negative impact on surrounding properties; and
(h) Increased attention to architectural design that will contribute to the overall character of Vandalia.
1222.02 Scope and Applicability
(a) The intent of the PUD regulations is to provide a means for applying comprehensive and flexible planning and design techniques on properties substantially sized to accommodate such a plan. As such, the minimum size of any PUD project or plan shall be ten acres.
(b) PUDs are encouraged for large-scale developments that will have a mixture of uses, including a mixture of housing types, that are not all permitted within a single zoning district but where the PUD process will provide for a uniform review and set of standards that will create a cohesive, well-planned part of the City.
(c) The Planning Commission may authorize a PUD application on lots less than ten acres if the land is currently located in the MBO or DB District or where there proposed uses are of such a density or intensity that would not be otherwise permitted under a base zoning district in this code but is otherwise envisioned as part of the comprehensive plan.
(d) PUD applications shall not be applied to small lots or areas as a means of bypassing traditional zoning district regulations or applications where the Administrative Officer decides that a zoning map amendment to another zoning district or a variance application is the more appropriate option.

Section 1222.03: General Provisions
City of Vandalia, Ohio - Planning and Zoning Code 78
January 17, 2019
(e) Any PUD approved and constructed prior to the effective date of this code amendment shall be subject to the requirements of the plans approved as part of that PUD. All future construction or changes shall comply with the applicable approved plan unless a modification is required, in which case, the modification shall be reviewed in accordance with this code and the procedures of Section 1214.08.
1222.03 General Provisions
(a) The applicant must own in fee simple or have an option to purchase all lands within the proposed PUD. The exception to this is if the applicant is the authorized agent for the property owner, in which case, the applicant need not own the lands.
(b) Any transfer of land within the development resulting in a change of ownership within the development after an application has been filed shall not alter the applicability of the regulations contained herein provided any new owners authorize the continuation of the PUD process.
(c) No zoning certificate or building permits may be issued until the PUD final development plan is approved and a final subdivision plat, if required, has been recorded in accordance with this code.
1222.04 Conflict of Laws and PUD Variances
(a) Unless otherwise noted below or elsewhere in this chapter, the site development standards and design standards of this code are not mandatory but shall serve as a guide for reviewing a proposed PUD plan. Other subjects not addressed by this chapter shall be governed by the respective provisions found elsewhere in the Codified Ordinances.
(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) below, deviations from the underlying zoning requirements shall not be considered variances and shall be determined by the Planning Commission and City Council as part of the PUD plan approval.
(c) Following approval of the PUD, any deviations from the underlying PUD requirements for a single lot in the PUD shall be reviewed as part of a variance application. If the proposed deviation will apply universally across the entire PUD or apply to areas of the same use, then such deviation shall be reviewed as a modification of the PUD in accordance with Section 1214.08. Where a variance is reviewed as part of a PUD, the BZA may consider any uniformity requirements in the existing PUD as a part of the variance review criteria.
(d) The Administrative Officer shall provide Planning Commission and City Council a report for any proposed PUD creation or modification that requires City Council approval, identifying all zoning matters where the proposed PUD or modification differs from an underlying zoning requirement.
1222.05 Use Regulations
(a) Principal Uses
(1) Only those uses listed in Section 1218.03, as a permitted use, whether permitted as-of-right or as a conditional use, may be considered in the application of a PUD.
(2) In general, any use-specific standards that applies to a specific use in Section 1218.03 shall also apply to those same uses in a PUD. However, the Planning Commission and City Council may adjust or waive any of those use-specific standards.
(3) Where multiple uses are proposed for the same PUD that are traditionally seen as incompatible (e.g., residential and industrial), such uses may be permitted in the same PUD but the applicant shall demonstrate that screening or buffering is incorporated that is equal to or better than what is required by this code under the base zoning districts.

Section 1222.06: Development Standards
City of Vandalia, Ohio - Planning and Zoning Code 79
January 17, 2019
(4) As part of any approval, the Planning Commission and/or City Council may restrict the uses permitted within an individual PUD.
(5) No land or structure shall be used or occupied so as to create any nuisance or hazard involving fire, explosion, noise, vermin, brilliant light, vibration, smoke, dust, fumes, odor, heat, cold, disease, dampness, electrical or electronic disturbance, radiation and/or toxic agents.
(6) Any changes in principal uses within an approved PUD shall be required to be reviewed as part of a major PUD modification.
(b) Accessory Uses
(1) Unless otherwise allowed for in the approved plans, accessory uses associated with development in a PUD shall be allowed in accordance with the following: Accessory uses permitted in the RSF-1 district shall be allowed for any single-family dwelling. Accessory uses allowed in the RMF district shall be allowed for any two-family, three-family, or multi-family dwelling. Accessory uses allowed in the GB and I zoning districts shall be allowed for nonresidential uses.
(2) Any allowed accessory uses shall still comply with the applicable accessory use standards established in Chapter 1224: Accessory and Temporary Use Regulations.
(3) As part of any approval, the Planning Board and/or City Council may restrict the accessory uses permitted within an individual PUD.
1222.06 Development Standards
Where this code provides for design and development standards not specifically addressed in this chapter, development within a PUD shall comply with the applicable standard of this code.
(a) Land Use Density and Intensity
(1) Final land use density and intensity of uses shall be subject to approval of the Planning Commission and City Council during the PUD Preliminary Plan review process.
(2) There shall be no minimum lot size requirements, however, the application shall demonstrate that the proposed lots are sufficient in size to accommodate stormwater runoff and all the site features (e.g., parking, accessory uses, landscaping etc.) otherwise required by this chapter and code. All residential uses shall have a maximum impervious surface coverage of 50 percent on all lots.
(3) In general, the overall gross density of a residential component of a PUD shall comply with the comprehensive plan. Residential densities shall not exceed six dwellings units per gross acre for single-family development, eight units per acre for two-family residential development, and 12 units per acre for multi-family dwelling development. However, the Planning Commission and City Council may require a lower density to ensure compatibility with the densities of surrounding developments.
(4) In the case of a PUD with a mixture of housing types, the preliminary plan shall demonstrate a design where densities adjacent to existing development are similar in density or where some type of buffering is provided to serve as a transition.
(5) For nonresidential uses, the overall intensity of development shall be compatible with the recommendations of the comprehensive plan and with the capacity of public streets, drainage facilities, and utilities.

Chapter 1224: Accessory and Temporary Use Regulations
1224.01 Accessory Uses and Structures
(a) Purpose
This section authorizes the establishment of accessory uses and structures that are incidental and customarily subordinate to principal uses. The intent of this section is to allow a broad range of accessory uses while not creating adverse impacts on surrounding lands.
(b) General Provisions
(1) An accessory use or structure shall be incidental to the primary use of the lot, and shall not alter the character of the principal use.
(2) Accessory uses and structures shall be constructed on the same lot as the principal use that it serves.
(3) No accessory structure shall be constructed on any lot until the construction of the principal structure has commenced. In cases where the main or principal structure is demolished, an existing accessory structure shall be allowed to remain on the lot or property without the main structure to which it is supposed to be an accessory on the following conditions: Up to two years, consistent with that allowed by Chapter 1240: Nonconformities; or A zoning certificate and building permit is obtained for the reconstruction of the main or principal structure, the construction of which shall take place within two years. Failure to reconstruct the main or principal structure will be an automatic cause for the removal of the accessory structure at the owner's expense.
(4) Small accessory structures such as doghouses, benches, garden decorations, barbeque equipment, etc. shall be exempt from the provisions of this section provided they do not have a footprint that exceeds 50 square feet individually.
(5) Gardens and the raising of crops for the personal use of the residents, tenants, or property owners, may be grown in any yard except the front yard, without a permit.
(6) An accessory structure that is attached to the principal building shall be considered an integral part of the principal building and shall comply with the site development standards (See Sections 1226.04 and 1226.05.) and all other development standards of the applicable zoning district. Any accessory structure shall be considered as an integral part of the principal building if it is connected to the principal building either by common walls or by a breezeway or roof.
(7) The accessory use regulations of this chapter shall not apply to any public park lands owned by the City, Montgomery County, Five Rivers Metro Parks, or the State of Ohio.
(8) Height Limit
Unless otherwise stated, the maximum height of a detached accessory structure shall be 20 feet in all districts except the I District, where the maximum height shall be 30 feet. In no case shall an accessory structure exceed the height of the principal building.
(9) Number and Size Requirements Accessory buildings and structures in all zoning districts shall be subject to lot coverage standards in Sections 1226.04 and 1226.05.

Section 1224.01: Accessory Uses and Structures
City of Vandalia, Ohio - Planning and Zoning Code 84
January 17, 2019
No detached accessory structure shall be located less than six feet from the principal building. If the separation of the accessory and main structure is less than six feet, the accessory structure shall be protected with a fire-resistant material and shall conform to the same yard requirements as the principal building. All accessory buildings in agricultural and residential zoning districts shall be set back a minimum of 10 feet from all buildings located on adjacent lots. This setback shall be increased to 20 feet for all accessory buildings in nonresidential zoning districts.
(c) Prohibited Structures for Accessory Uses
Except as provided in this code, the use of inflatable garages or storage structures, portable carports or garages that are not permanently anchored into a foundation, temporary structures as established in Section 1224.02, portable containers, shipping containers, and semi-tractor trailers used for storage (with or without wheels) shall not be used as permanent accessory structures in any zoning district.
(d) Permitted Accessory Uses
The following is an explanation of Table 1224-2.
(1) The symbols for permitted uses (P), permitted uses with standards (PS), and conditional uses (C) are defined in the same manner as Section 1218.03(b).
(2) Prohibited Uses
An “X” in a cell or a blank cell indicates that a use is prohibited in the respective zoning district.
(3) Yards Permitted
This column identifies within which yards the use may be permitted. See the use-specific standards for any restrictions related to placement in individual yards. See Section 1226.02 for a determination of where front yards, side yards, and rear yards are located on different lot types.
(4) Zoning Certificate Required
A “Yes” in the “Zoning Certificate Required” column shall mean that the applicable accessory structure requires a zoning certificate in order to be constructed.
(5) Lot Coverage
A “Yes” in the “Lot Coverage” column shall mean that the footprint of the applicable accessory structure shall be calculated as part of the maximum lot coverage standards established in Sections 1226.04 and 1226.05.
(6) Use-Specific Standards
The numbers contained in the “Use-Specific Standards” column are references to additional standards and requirements that apply to the use type listed. Standards referenced in the “Use-Specific Standards” column apply in all zoning districts unless otherwise expressly stated.
(7) Use Determination and Unlisted Uses The Administrative Officer shall make the determination if a proposed use is permitted, permitted with standards, a conditional use, or a prohibited use under the provisions of this section. Section 1214.06 identifies the procedure the City will use in addressing uses that are similar to other uses in Table 1224-2, or uses that are unlisted.

(e) Standards for Specific Accessory Uses and Structures
The following requirements apply to the specific types of accessory uses and structures listed, in addition to the requirements of Section 1224.01(b).
(1) Accessibility Ramps
Ramps that provide access to buildings for the disabled are permitted in all zoning districts and may encroach in all setbacks but shall not encroach on a public sidewalk, easement, right-of-way, or street.
(2) Amateur Radio Towers and Antenna No more than one amateur radio tower and/or antenna shall be permitted on each lot. Ground-mounted amateur radio towers, antennas, and related guy wire anchors must be located in the rear yard. Building-mounted amateur radio towers and antennas must be located to the rear of the centerline of the principal building. Such tower shall not exceed 65 feet in height or the maximum height of the applicable zoning district, whichever is greater. The measurement shall be made from the grade directly beneath the tower to the highest point on the antenna or tower, whichever is the tallest point of the structure. Antennas and guy wire anchors shall not overhang or otherwise be located within required accessory structure setbacks or on adjacent lots. When an amateur radio tower and antenna is no longer being used by an FCC amateur radio license holder for amateur radio service, the tower and antenna must be removed no more than 180 days after cessation of the FCC license or the transfer or property ownership or lease to an individual without an FCC license.
Chapter 1224: Accessory and Temporary Use Regulations
Section 1224.01: Accessory Uses and Structures
City of Vandalia, Ohio - Planning and Zoning Code 87
January 17, 2019
Amateur radio towers and antennas that do not comply with the provisions of this section shall require a conditional use approval (See Section 1214.05.). The application for a conditional use approval for amateur radio towers and antennas must demonstrate that compliance with the provisions of this section would prevent the amateur radio operator from exercising the rights granted to him or her by the FCC or the State of Ohio by license or law. If the Planning Commission determines that expertise beyond that of City staff is necessary to determine compliance with this criterion, then the applicant shall reimburse the City for any expenses necessary for hiring a third-party consultant to make this determination.
(3) Basketball Hoops Basketball courts shall be subject to the standards of Section 1224.01(e)(26). Movable basketball hoops shall not be located in rights-of-way or be so located as to require play in any right-of-way.
(4) Beekeeping Beekeeping as an accessory use shall be permitted in the A and all residential districts except for the RTF, RFF, and RMF Districts. Honey bee colonies shall be kept in hives with removable frames, which shall be kept in sound and usable condition. Each beekeeper shall ensure that a convenient source of water is available to the colony so long as colonies remain active outside of the hive. Each beekeeper shall ensure that no wax comb or other material that might encourage robbing by other bees are left upon the grounds of the apiary lot. Such materials once removed from the site shall be handled and stored in sealed containers, or placed within a building or other insect proof container. For each colony permitted to be maintained under this code, there may also be maintained upon the same apiary lot, one nucleus colony in a hive structure not to exceed one standard 9-5/8-inch depth 10-frame hive body with no supers. Each beekeeper shall maintain his beekeeping equipment in good condition, including keeping the hives painted if they have been painted but are peeling or flaking, and securing unused equipment from weather, potential theft or vandalism and occupancy by swarms.

Double frontage lots shall be discouraged and shall only be approved if necessitated by unique topographic features or other special physical conditions as deemed necessary by the Planning Commission. Double frontage lots shall be subject to the following regulations: Where a lot is considered a double frontage (through lot) lot, the required minimum front yard setback shall be provided on all lot lines that abut a street. See Figure 1226-E. The remaining lot lines not abutting a public road right-of-way shall be considered as side yards and shall have the required minimum side yard setback provided for each side lot line. See Figure 1226-E.
Figure 1226-E: Yard locations on double frontage (through) lots. For the purposes of allowing accessory uses, including fences, which are allowed in a rear yard, the yard that is located to the rear of the principal building shall be considered the rear yard and the setbacks of Section 1224.01, shall apply to all accessory uses or structures. Where alleys exist in the City, any lots that have frontage along the alley shall be not be considered a double frontage (through) lot and shall either be regulated as an interior lot or corner lot depending on the location of the subject lot within the block.

When screening from a public right-of-way, screening shall be maintained between two and one-half and three and one-half feet in length.
(b) Screening of Vehicular Use Areas from Rights-of-Way
When a vehicular use area is located adjacent to a public street right-of-way, screening shall be provided to reduce the visual impact of the vehicular use area. A landscaped screening shall be installed between the parking lot and public rights-of-way per the following requirements:
(1) A landscaped screen shall be located directly adjacent to the vehicular use area and be no less than 10 feet in width in all districts, except the DB District, where the screen may be three feet wide. The buffer shall be composed of a continuous evergreen hedge or dense planting of evergreen shrubs.
(2) The screening shall be at a height of no less than three feet at the time of installation. The screening may be placed upon an earthen mound to achieve the required height at planting except in the DB District where the use of an earthen mound is prohibited. The minimum screen height requirement shall not apply when the grading of the site results in an elevation of the adjacent street which is three or more feet higher than the vehicular use area.
(3) A fence or a wall may be incorporated into the landscape buffer per the fence requirements of the applicable zoning district. See Section 1224.01(e)(9).
(c) Screening of Service Areas
In addition to the other forms of required landscaping, screening shall be required to conceal specific areas of high visual or auditory impact or hazardous areas from adjacent, less intense uses and from views from public rights-of-way.

Chapter 1236: Sign Standards
1236.01 Findings and Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare through the provision of standards for existing and proposed signs of all types. More specifically, this chapter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech while also:
(a) Enhancing and protecting the physical appearance of the community;
(b) Promoting and maintaining visually attractive, residential, retail, commercial, and manufacturing districts;
(c) Balancing the constitutional rights of individuals to convey messages through signs with the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(d) Ensuring that signs are located and designed to reduce sign distraction and confusion that may be contributing factors in traffic congestion and accidents, and maintain a safe and orderly pedestrian and vehicular environment;
(e) Preventing the erection of structures of any kind that will obstruct sight distance at the intersection of streets, alleys, or driveways;
(f) Preventing the erection of poorly constructed and unsafely located, posted, or painted signs;
(g) Providing review procedures that enable the City to comprehensively evaluate the appropriateness of a sign to the site, building, and surroundings;
(h) Regulating the proper construction, maintenance, safety, and structural soundness, as well as the appearance and attractiveness of signs;
(i) Prohibiting all signs not expressly permitted by this chapter;
(j) Protecting the rights of property owners and occupants to display messages protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and
(k) Recognizing the public’s right to receive and display messages protected by the First Amendment, including but not limited to, religious, political, economic, social, and philosophical messages subject, however, to reasonable regulations to assure safety and minimize visual blight.
1236.02 Applicability
(a) It shall hereafter be unlawful for any person to erect, place, relocate, expand, modify, maintain, or otherwise alter a sign within the corporate limits of the City of Vandalia except in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(b) Any sign legally established prior to the effective date of this chapter, and which sign is rendered nonconforming by the provisions herein, shall be subject to the nonconforming sign regulations of Section 1236.14 and not the nonconforming structure regulations of Chapter 1240:Nonconformities.

Section 1236.03: Substitution and Protection Clause
City of Vandalia, Ohio - Planning and Zoning Code 168
January 17, 2019
1236.03 Substitution and Protection Clause
(a) Wherever a sign with a commercial message is allowed or permitted under this chapter, an owner may replace the message with a noncommercial message, subject to the time, place and manner provisions of this chapter, without applying for a permit and/or paying a fee that otherwise would be required for the placement of a commercial message sign on the lot; provided, that the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. This provision prevails over any provision to the contrary in this chapter. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a lot or parcel, nor does it affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted.
(b) All noncommercial speech is considered on-premise signage and is entitled to the privileges that on-premise signs receive under this section. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, signs that display a noncommercial message are entitled to the maximum square footage allowed any sign within the same zoning district. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, signs that display a noncommercial message are not subject to the temporal limitations otherwise set forth in this chapter; however, such signs remain subject to the provisions of Section 1236.08(o).

The legitimate interests of those who lawfully established these nonconformities, especially when dealing with a person’s residence, are herein recognized by providing for the continuance of such uses, subject to regulations limiting their completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension, and/or substitution. Nevertheless, while it is the intent of this code that such nonconformities be allowed to continue until removed, they should not be encouraged to survive, unless otherwise allowed in this chapter or specifically addressed in this code.
1240.02 General Provisions
(a) Any structure, land, or use of land or a structure that existed at the time of the effective date of this code that was legally established under a previous code amendment or versions may be continued even if such use, building, structure, or use of land does not conform to the provisions of this code.
(b) Passage of this code in no way legalizes any illegal uses existing at the time of its adoption.
(c) An applicant for any development review procedure (e.g., zoning certificate, site plan review, variance, etc.) that deals with a nonconformity shall bear the burden of proof in demonstrating that the use was a legal nonconformity on the effective date of this code.

(a) At the time of application for a zoning certificate, or request for variance regarding a nonconforming lot, building, structure or use, the property owner shall submit sufficient evidence for the Administrative Officer or BZA, as applicable, to determine that such lot, building, structure, or use was lawfully created or established in accordance with the code regulations in existence at that time.
(b) If the evidence submitted indicates the lot, building, structure or use was legally established and has since become nonconforming because of the establishment of, or amendment to, this code, the Administrative Officer shall issue a zoning certificate identifying it as a legal nonconformity.

Section 1240.05: Nonconforming Uses
City of Vandalia, Ohio - Planning and Zoning Code 209
January 17, 2019
1240.05 Nonconforming Uses
Where, at the time of adoption of this code, lawful uses of land or structures exist that would not be permitted by the regulations of this code, the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful and provided:
(a) No such nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code unless it complies with the provisions of Section 1240.05(e).
(b) No such nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code.
(c) No additional structures shall be constructed on a lot with a nonconforming use unless such new structure complies with the requirements of this code and the applicable zoning district.
(d) Change or Substitution of Nonconforming Use
(1) If no structural alterations are made that increase the nonconformity, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or of a more restricted use, as determined by the BZA. Such determination shall be made at a public hearing held in the same manner as a variance (See Section 1214.11.), including notice, but the variance review criteria of Section 1214.11(d) shall not apply. At the hearing, the BZA shall make a determination if the proposed use, which must be a permitted use in the applicable zoning district, is similar in nature and intensity, or is a more restricted use, allowable as a change or substitution under this section.
(2) Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a less intensive nonconforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a more intensive nonconforming use.
(3) Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the applicable zoning district in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
(e) Expansion of a Nonconforming Use
(1) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions to the contrary, a structure containing a nonconforming residential use (not including mixed use buildings or live/work units) may be increased or improved, regardless of the applicable zoning district, provided the structure continues thereafter to be used for residential purposes only and meets all required setbacks.
(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions to the contrary, a structure containing a nonconforming, nonresidential use, may be increased or improved, regardless of the applicable zoning district, where the owner of such use can demonstrate through application to the BZA that the manner in which the useable area of the nonconforming use will be increased or improved will have minimal adverse impact upon adjacent properties and other permitted land uses in the surrounding neighborhood or can be made compatible with the adjacent properties and the uses in the surrounding neighborhood upon compliance with specified conditions.
(3) Factors that may be considered in determining an adverse impact include but are not limited to: Noise, odor, and/or vibrations; Traffic; Visual impacts;
Chapter 1240: Nonconformities
Section 1240.05: Nonconforming Uses
City of Vandalia, Ohio - Planning and Zoning Code 210
January 17, 2019
Access to light and air from adjoining properties; Existence of screening; The hours of operation; The effect on the access to the property by fire, police, or other public services; and The predominant or prevailing land use, building and structure patterns of the surrounding neighborhoods.
(4) Variances to expand a nonconforming use into a required setback or to otherwise vary a regulation that applies to the subject site shall be prohibited.
(f) Existing Use Reclassified as a Conditional Use
In the event an existing use that was permitted by right at the time the use was established is thereafter reclassified as a conditional use in the applicable district due to a zoning text amendment, such use shall be considered to be an approved conditional use without any further action. However, any subsequent change to such use shall require review and approval in accordance with Section 1214.05. Such use, provided it is conditionally permitted in the applicable district, shall not be considered a nonconforming use.
(g) Termination of Nonconforming Uses
(1) Termination of Use through Discontinuance When any nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for more than two years, any new use shall conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. The intent to continue a nonconforming use shall not be evidence of its continuance. There may be cases when a structure, or structure and premises in combination, may not be converted to a conforming use because of the original floor plan and design (e.g. townhouses in a single-family residentially zoned area). In these cases, the BZA may determine that the nonconforming use may continue if the nonconforming use is the original use of the structure and/or premises. Appropriate safeguards, conditions and design standards may be required by the BZA so as to minimize the impact of such continuance on the area.
(2) Termination of Use by Damage or Destruction If a nonconforming single-family dwelling, in any district, is damaged or destroyed to any extent, such structure and use may be reestablished on the same lot provided it meets the same size in height and footprint, as well as complying with the same setbacks as previously existed. If any nonconforming use, other than a single-family dwelling, is damaged, but not to an extent greater than 50 percent of the principal structure’s market value according to the Montgomery County Auditor, such structure and use may be reestablished on the same lot to the same size and intensity of use as was previously existing immediately prior to the damage or destruction. Such reestablishment of the use shall require the issuance of a zoning certificate, which must be issued within six months of the damage or the use shall not be reestablished. If any nonconforming use, other than a single-family dwelling, is damaged beyond 50 percent of the principal structure’s market value according to the Montgomery County Auditor, such structure and use may only be reestablished with approval by the BZA after consideration of surrounding uses and the impact of the nonconforming use.

1240.06 Nonconforming Structures and Sites
A nonconforming building or structure may continue to be used or occupied by a use permitted in the applicable zoning district so long as it remains otherwise lawful and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the following provisions:
(a) Any nonconforming structure or site may be enlarged, maintained, repaired, or altered provided, however, no such enlargement, maintenance, repair or alteration shall either create an additional nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of all or any part of such structure or site, unless otherwise specified in this code.
(b) A nonconforming structure shall not be relocated in whole or in part to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the applicable zoning district after being relocated.
(c) The principal use of a nonconforming building may be changed to any other use permitted in the applicable zoning district as long as the new use complies with all regulations of this code specified for such use, except the regulations to which the building did not conform prior to the change in use.
(d) The governmental acquisition of a portion of a lot for a public purpose that results in reduction in a required yard or building setback below that required in the applicable zoning district shall not render a structure nonconforming.
(e) Damage or Destruction of a Nonconforming Structure Containing a Conforming Use
(1) If a nonconforming structure is damaged, but not to an extent greater than 75 percent of the structure’s market value, as determined by the Montgomery County Auditor, such structure and use may be reestablished on the same lot to the same size and intensity of use as was previously existing immediately prior to the damage or destruction. Such reestablishment of the use shall require the issuance of a zoning certificate. If an owner rebuilds a legally nonconforming structure under this provision, they may expand the structure provided any expansion or change does not increase the nonconformity that existed prior to the damage.
(2) If a nonconforming structure is damaged beyond 75 percent of the structure’s market value, such structure shall only be rebuilt in compliance with the requirements of this code, with the exception that if the nonconforming structure did not meet the minimum square footage requirement specified in Section 1226.04, the structure may be rebuilt to the original square footage. Such reconstruction shall require the application and issuance of all necessary zoning and building permits.
(3) If the owner voluntarily removes the structure or reduces the nonconformity, that has not been damaged or destroyed, that owner shall not be permitted to rebuild the structure to the original height, size, or setback.

A request to vary the site development standards shall only be allowed through the issuance of a variance.
(b) If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this code, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot frontage and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for purposes of this code and shall be legally combined prior to the issuance of any permits. No portion of such parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot frontage and area requirements established by this code, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot frontage or area below the requirements stated in this code.
