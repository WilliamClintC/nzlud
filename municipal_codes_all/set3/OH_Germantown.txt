Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observances throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   There are no sections in Chapter
103. This chapter has been established to provide a place for cross references
and any future legislation.

135.17  INVESTMENT AND PORTFOLIO POLICY.
   Effective cash management is recognized as essential to good fiscal
management.  This is particularly true as mounting costs and expanding programs
have placed ever increasing pressures on local governmental revenues. 
Investment returns on funds not immediately required can help to reduce this
pressure.  Effective cash management of these funds requires that an investment
and deposit policy be well-founded and uncompromisingly applied.
   (a)   Policy Statement.  It is the policy of the Municipality of Germantown
(the “Municipality”) to deposit and invest public funds in a manner which will
provide the highest investment return with the maximum security while meeting
the daily cash flow demands of the Municipality and conforming to all state and
local statutes governing the investment of public funds.
   (b)   Scope.  This investment and deposit policy (“Policy”) applies to all
monies of the Municipality, except for monies whose investment and deposit are
otherwise controlled by an independent board, advisory, counsel, or trustee
under the requirements of mortgage revenue bond indentures or endowment trusts
(as in the case of certain mortgage revenue bond debt service funds and debt
service reserve funds and certain non-expendable trust funds).  The
Municipality’s funds subject to this Policy are hereinafter referred to as the
“Active Portfolio”.
The Finance Director is authorized to pool cash balances from the several
different funds of the Municipality for investment purposes.  Unless otherwise
restricted, all investment earnings will be credited to the General Fund of the
Municipality.
This investment policy applies to activities of the Municipality with regard to
investing the financial assets of all funds, including the following:
         General Fund
         Special Revenue Funds
         Capital Improvement Funds
         Debt Service Funds
         Special Assessment Funds
         Enterprise Funds
         Trust and Agency Funds
   (c)   Objectives and Guidelines.  The following investment and deposit
objectives will be applied in the management of municipal funds:
      (1)   The primary objective of the Municipality’s investment activities
is the preservation of capital and the protection of investment principal.
      (2)   In investing public funds, the Municipality will strive to maximize
the return on the portfolio, but will avoid assuming unreasonable investment
risks.
      (3)   The Municipality’s investment portfolio will remain sufficiently
liquid to enable the Municipality to meet operating requirements which might be
reasonably anticipated.
      (4)   The Municipality will diversify its investments to avoid incurring
the unreasonable and avoidable risks regarding specific security types or
individual financial institutions.
      (5)   Banks vary in the services they provide, their service fees,
interest rates on interim investments and the minimum compensating balances
required for demand-deposit accounts.  The Municipality’s objective is to
obtain good banking services while minimizing the cost of bank services to the
Municipality.
   (d)   Prudence.  Deposit and investment of Municipal funds shall be made
with the exercise of that degree of judgment and care, under circumstances then
prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in
the management of their own affairs, not for speculation but for investment,
considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income
to be delivered (hereinafter referred to as “The Prudent Person Standard”).
The standard of prudence to be used by Municipal officials involved in the
deposit and investment of municipal funds shall be the The Prudent Person
Standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. 
Municipal officials acting in accordance with written procedures and this
Policy and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal
responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market price
changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse development.
   (e)   Finance Director.  Authority to manage the Municipality’s deposits and
investment program is derived from the Municipal Charter.  The Finance
Director, as Chief Financial Officer of the Municipality, shall be charged with
the administration of this Policy.  The Finance Director shall have the right
to assign such duties and responsibilities, as he or she deems appropriate, in
keeping with the efficient and prudent management of such Policy.
   (f)   Authorized Financial Institutions and Dealers. 
      (1)   Depositories.  Each of the following criteria shall be met in order
for a bank to be considered an eligible depository:
         A.   The bank shall be a nationally chartered commercial bank
organized under the laws of the State of Ohio.
            (Ord. 99-38.  Passed 6-21-99.)
         B.   The bank shall have exhibited consistent credit-worthiness as
evidenced by at least an “average” rating within its peer group in the three
most recent issues of an industry-recognized bank rating publishing service
such as IDC Financial Publishing’s Bank Financial Quarterly, Sheshunoff’s Bank
Quarterly, or similar rating service selected by the Finance Director.  The
bank rating publishing service will utilize measures of capital risk, asset
quality, margin, earnings, and leverage (“CAMEL”) to determine relative
strength of financial institutions.  The Finance Director shall define the term
“average” in the absence of an explicit definition by the rating service.
To the extent practical, the Finance Director will minimize the number of
depositories for the efficient, effective and economical deposit of
Municipality funds, and may do so by issuing a formal Request for Proposal as
frequently as he or she determines necessary.  Exceptions to this
centralization of depository provision will be made when trust agreements or
other legal mandates dictate specific handling or investment requirements that
may not be obtained or most efficiently managed through existing depositories.
The Finance Director is authorized to enter into the Depository Agreement set
forth in subsection (l) of this Policy.
All Municipal funds deposited with depository banks shall be secured by
collateral as prescribed in subsection (l) hereof.
         (Ord. 03-102.  Passed 12-1-03.)
      (2)   Broker/dealers - securities purchases.
         A.   Eligibility requirements.
            1.   Nationally chartered commercial banks organized within and
under laws of the United States, which are insured through the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and which are members of the Federal Reserve; or
            2.   Broker/dealer firms which are registered with the National
Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and which are affiliated with a
commercial bank meeting the requirements set forth in subsection (f)(2)A.1.
hereof; or
            3.   Through primary securities dealers as designated by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York and which qualify under Securities & Exchange
Commission Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1.
         B.   Annual certification.
A dealer or commercial bank through which securities other than non-negotiable
interest bearing certificates of deposit will be purchased or sold, shall
provide on an annual basis a completed and certified Broker/Dealer
Questionnaire and Certification (see Exhibit A).  The minimum acceptable
criteria to be met annually in order to be approved as an Authorized Broker/
Dealer will include:
            1.   The broker/dealer must meet the eligibility requirements set
forth in subsection (f)(2)A. hereof;
            2.   The broker/dealer and the personnel assigned to service the
Municipality’s account must be licensed to sell securities in the State of
Ohio;
            3.   The broker/dealer must provide the documentation requested
under Section 23 of Exhibit A, the Broker/Dealer Questionnaire and
Certification (proof of “primary dealer” designation or proof of FDIC coverage
audited annual financial report, proof of State of Ohio licensing compliance).
         C.   The Finance Director shall:
            1.   Make additions to the authorized list when the above described
criteria are met;
            2.   Make deletions from the authorized list if directed by
ordinance of the Municipal Council or upon failure of the broker/dealer to meet
the foregoing investment and deposit policy requirements, or upon request of
the broker/dealer; and
            3.   Make deletions from the list based on the following criteria
or circumstances:
               a.   Perceived financial difficulties of the broker/dealer;
               b.   Consistent lack of competitiveness by the broker/dealer;
               c.   Lack of experience or familiarity of the account
representative in providing service to large institutional accounts; or
               d.   When deemed in the best interest of the Municipality.
   (g)   Maturity.  To the extent possible, the Municipality will attempt to
match the term to maturity of its investments with anticipated cash flow
requirements.  A security trading on a “when issued” basis may be purchased or
sold if all aspects of the security and the trade meet the requirements of this
Policy.
   (h)   Diversification.  To avoid incurring unreasonable risks inherent in
over-investing in specific instruments, individual financial institutions,
dealers, or maturities, the Finance Director will diversify the Active
Portfolio as follows:
 
Diversification of Instrument                      Maximum Percent of
                                                   County’s Active Portfolio
U.S. Treasury Obligations                          50%
Authorized U.S. Federal Agency Securities and U.S. 80%
Government-sponsored Corporations
Non-negotiable Certificates of Deposit             60%
Authorized Bankers Acceptance                      20%
State of Ohio Treasurer’s Investment Pool        80%
Prime Commercial Paper                             20%
 
Diversification by Issuer (Obligor)
Non-negotiable Certificates of Deposit             40%
Bankers Acceptances                             5%
Prime Commercial Paper                             3%
 
No transaction needs to be executed when, through inadvertence or unusual
circumstances, maturity in the active portfolio causes the percentage of a type
or category of investment to exceed the diversification limits set forth
above.  Any transactions after such infraction shall work toward returning to
compliance.
   (i)   Authorized Investments.  The Finance Director may invest on behalf of
and in the name of the Municipality in only those instruments which appear on
the List of Authorized Investment Instruments (Exhibit B) and only at a price
not exceeding their fair market value.  The Finance Director annually on or
about May 1st and at other times will update the List of Authorized Investment
Instruments if  necessary.
In the event the List of Authorized Investment Instruments authorizes the use
of repurchase agreements, before transacting a repurchase agreement with a
particular broker/dealer, a Master Repurchase Agreement shall be entered into
between the Municipality and that particular broker.  Each Master Repurchase
Agreement will provide for:
      (1)   Collateralization of each repurchase agreement, the market value of
which shall not be less than one hundred two percent (102%) of the principal
amount of each repurchase agreement plus accrued interest;
      (2)   Safekeeping of the collateral by the Municipality’s third-party
safekeeping agent; and
      (3)   Settlement of each repurchase agreement on a delivery-versus-
payment basis.  Master Repurchase Agreements may provide for substitution of
collateral by the broker/dealer with the agreement of the Municipality.
The List of Authorized Investment Instruments will be kept on file in the
office of the Finance Director.
   (j)   Safekeeping and Custody.  In order to minimize default-risk, the
County Treasurer will require delivery of investment instruments as follows:
      (1)   Government securities, bankers’ acceptances, commercial paper and
other authorized money market securities.  Book entry or physical securities
shall be safekept by a third party safekeeping agent, in agent’s:
         A.   Federal Reserve customer account;
         B.   Correspondent money center bank customer custody account; or
         C.   Depository Trust Corporation (DTC) customer custody account.
   A safekeeping receipt shall evidence each delivery and safekeeping.
      (2)   Non-negotiable interest bearing time certificates of deposit.  The
Municipality will take possession, for safekeeping in its own vault, of all
Certificates of Deposit or document(s) evidencing a Certificate of Deposit in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 135.14, the acceptable time of delivery being no
later than 2:00 p.m. the day of settlement.
   In the event that the Certificate of Deposit or document(s) evidencing the
Certificate of Deposit must be prepared at a home office of the issuing bank
outside the Municipality of Germantown, the Municipality will require an
overnight safekeeping document delivery of the Certificate of Deposit or
documents evidencing a Certificate of Deposit no later than 12:00 Noon the
first business day after date of settlement.
      (3)   Repurchase agreements.  (See subsection (i) hereof, Authorized
Investment Instruments)
   (k)   Competitive Selection of Investment Instruments.  Before the
Municipality invests any funds, a competitive bid process may be conducted.  An
approximate maturity will be determined and bids will be requested for
instruments that meet the maturity requirement.  If a maturity of less than
thirty days is required, the funds may be invested in the State Investments
Pool without bidding.  The Municipality will accept the bid that provides the
highest rate of return within the maturing required and within the perimeters
of these policies.
Records will be kept of the bids offered, the bids accepted and a brief
explanation of the decision that was made regarding the investment.
   (l)   Collateralization of Municipal Deposits.
      (1)   With the approval of the Finance Director,  a depository may
provide collateral for deposits of the Municipality with a single pool of
securities pledged toward all deposits of public funds held by the depository,
in the manner provided in Ohio R.C. 135.181.
      (2)   Unless secured in the manner provided in Ohio R.C. 135.181
(subsection (l)(1) hereof), all deposits of the Municipality shall be secured
by pledged collateral in the manner provided in Ohio R.C. 135.18.
      (3)   The method of collateralization of the Municipal deposits shall be
set forth in a depository agreement between the Municipality and the depository
institution.  The depository agreement, in accordance with requirements set
forth by Federal Depository Insurance Corporation, shall be:
         A.   In writing;
         B.   Executed by the depository institution and any person claiming an
adverse interest thereunder, including the obligor, contemporaneously with the
acquisition of the asset by the depository institution;
         C.   Approved by the board of directors of the depository institution
or its loan committee, which approval shall be reflected in the minutes of said
board or committee;
         D.   Be continuously, from the date of its execution, an official
record of the depository institution; and
         E.   Approved by the Municipal Law Director.
   (m)   Reporting and Performance Standards.  The Finance Director will be
responsible for providing regular quarterly reports to the Investment Committee
and regular semi-annual reports to the Municipal Council about the
Municipality’s investment activities.  The report should include at least a
summary of the Municipality’s portfolio by institution and types of instruments
versus diversification limitations, average maturity, and changes in portfolio
size by fund.
   (n)   Legislative Action Required.  Inasmuch that this Policy has been duly
enacted by ordinance of the Germantown Council, any modifications hereto shall
be made only by the appropriate legislative action of that Council.  The only
exception to this section being those periodic updates to the list of
Authorized Investment Instruments as required by subsection (i) of this Policy.

of Ohio by each person within any of the classes established in subsection (b)

payable under the Municipality’s policies.  Such total salary of such employee
shall be payable by the Municipality in two parts: (1) deferred salary and (2)

that employee’s total salary which is required from time to time by PERS to be
paid by the Municipality to PERS on behalf of the employee as a pick up and in
lieu of the PERS employee contribution otherwise payable by that employee.  The
employee cash salary shall be equal to that employee’s total salary less the
amount of the pick up for that employee, and shall be payable, subject to
applicable payroll deductions, to that employee.  The Municipality shall
compute and remit its employer contributions to PERS based upon an employee’s

   (e)   The Finance Director is hereby authorized and directed to implement
the provisions of this section to institute the “pick up” of the statutorily

   Certain employees whose rate of pay exceeds the maximum amount set forth in
the various compensation schedules amended on June 16, 1997 shall remain at
their current rate of pay until such time as the schedules are increased,
pursuant to Section
161.11, to an amount greater than their current rate of pay.  Thereafter,
Council shall, by motion, determine the rate of pay for each employee, at such
time as it deems appropriate and necessary, in accordance with their respective
compensation schedule established for their position.
(Ord. 97-55.  Passed 7-21-97.)
161.30  EMPLOYEE TUITION REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM.
   The continuing education and development of all employees is most desirable;
in order to encourage such advancement, an Employee Tuition Reimbursement
Program is offered.  Any full- time employee who has passed his or her
probationary period is eligible for participation in the Employee Tuition
Reimbursement Program.
   The course of study must be reasonably related to the employee’s job, and
the employee must seek approval for participation in the Program from the
Municipal Manager prior to the start of actual course work.  The Municipality
will pay eighty percent (80%) of the tuition and necessary fees and texts at a
two-year degree institution, and sixty percent (60%) of the tuition at a four-
year degree institution, for courses related to the development of a regular
full-time employee.
   Upon satisfactorily completing the course and  achieving a final grade of B
or better, the employee must provide the Finance Department with proof of
satisfactory completion, as well as a copy of proof of tuition and receipts for
necessary fee and text payments, in order to receive reimbursement.  Failure to
achieve a grade of B or better, or failure to submit proof of satisfactory
completion will result in the forfeiture of reimbursement.
   Voluntary enrollment in courses shall normally occur outside of scheduled
work hours.  No wages or other compensation shall be earned while attending
courses.  Where it is impossible to obtain the educational opportunities other
than during scheduled work hours, the employee’s supervisor may authorize
attendance during the normal workday.
   Employees who enroll in the Employee Tuition Reimbursement Program and
terminate their employment with the Municipality within two years of completion
of a course will have their reimbursement reduced on the following pro-rated
basis:
 
Date of Termination           Percent of Reimbursement Reduced by:
                              2 Year Program 4 Year Program
0-12 months following course  100%           100%
13-18 months following course 60%            60%
19-24 months following course 40%            40%
 
   Any reimbursement owed by the participant will be deducted from the
employee’s last paycheck.
   The Municipal Manager is authorized to waive this requirement under unusual
and justifiable circumstances such as spousal  relocation, death of an
immediate relative forcing employee relocation or termination of employment due
to unusual circumstances, etc.
   The maximum reimbursement which participants of the Program may receive
during any calendar year is one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00).
(Ord. 00-18.  Passed 4-3-00; Ord. 16-16.  Passed 7-5-16.)

Municipal services.
   (b)   Accrued compensatory time shall not exceed twenty-four hours, unless
authorized in writing by the Municipal Manager, and shall be taken on or before
June 30 of each year.  Any unused compensatory time as of July 1 of each year
shall be paid at the employee’s wage rate in effect at the time the
compensatory time was accrued.
   (c)   Designation of compensatory time shall be made in the same manner as
any other leave is applied for.  (Ord.  00-51.  Passed 8-7-2000.)
161.311 COMPENSATORY TIME FOR SALARIED EMPLOYEES.
   (a)   Salaried employees are not eligible for overtime pay.  However,
salaried employees may take unpaid compensatory time off as approved by the
Municipal Manager, for overtime worked.  The time off must be approved, in
advance, by the Municipal Manager in order to avoid disruption of municipal
services.  (Ord. 12-33.  Passed 6-18-12.)
 
   (b)   Salaried employees may accrue unpaid compensatory time.  However,
under no circumstances shall any accrued unpaid compensatory time exceed 24
hours, unless authorized in writing by the Municipal Manager.  Compensatory
time for salaried employees shall be accrued on an hour for hour basis.  Under
no circumstances shall any accrued unpaid compensatory time be paid to any
salaried employee.  (Ord. 13-20.  Passed 4-15-13.)

163.01  NO SMOKING POLICY BY MANAGER.
   (a)   The Village Manager is hereby directed to establish a no smoking
policy for all Municipally owned structures and vehicles.
   (b)   The Village Manager is hereby authorized to amend such no smoking
policy as he deems appropriate and necessary.
(Ord. 93-01.  Passed 2-1-93.)
ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER #47
February 1, 1993
Effective April 3, 1993
No Smoking Policy
   This smoking policy is designed to foster the health and safety of all
Village of Germantown employees and its citizens.  It is also intended to
protect Village resources and promote efficiency.  To that end, this policy
prohibits smoking in all Village facilities and vehicles.
   Smoking poses a significant risk to the health of the smoker.  It can damage
sensitive technical equipment and can be a safety hazard.  Nonsmokers with
chronic heart or lung disease can experience severe distress when exposed to
sufficient concentrations of second-hand smoke.  Many allergic individuals and
the majority of healthy nonsmokers report discomfort when exposed to second-
hand smoke on the job.  The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that
involuntary smoking is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy
nonsmokers.
   The citizens of Germantown have the right to enter the Municipal Building
without being exposed to smoke.  Because the current set up of the building is
such that all areas are open to public visitation, no areas will be exempt from
the smoking policy.  Separate areas for smoking cannot be made available. 
Additionally, all areas of the building contain sensitive equipment and files
which could be damaged or destroyed by fire, ashes and smoke.  This policy
shall extend to include any areas where combustible fumes can collect, areas
where chemicals are used and all other designated areas where an occupational
hazard might exist.
   This policy shall be in effect (1) month after the effective date of
Ordinance 93-01.  The Village shall provide at the cost of the Municipality, a
smoking cessation program through Western Ohio Health Care and Good Samaritan
Hospital.  Interested employees should contact the Manager's office
immediately.
   Employees that violate the no smoking policy will be subject to appropriate
disciplinary measures.
   Visitors or guests in Municipal facilities or vehicles shall be requested to
refrain from smoking or to leave the premises.
   Everyone's cooperation in this effort is appreciated.
TITLE SEVEN- Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
      (a)    Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense
case for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more
than six months, or
      (b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto. "
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in_State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio st. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and  administrative officer
of the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality. "
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date. "
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

181.03  IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)    Subject to the provisions of Section
181.15, an annual tax for the purposes specified in Section
181.01 shall be imposed beginning January 1, 2019, at the rate of one and one
half percent (1.50%) per annum upon the following:
      (1)    On all income, salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation
received during the effective period of this chapter by residents of
Germantown, and on all income, salaries, wages, commissions, and other
compensation received during the effective period of this Chapter by
nonresidents for work done or services performed or rendered in the
Municipality of Germantown.
      (2)    12-Day Occasional Entry Rule. The Municipality of Germantown shall
not tax the compensation of a nonresident individual for personal services or
work performed by the individual in the Municipal corporation on twelve (12) or
fewer days in a calendar year (which hereby classifies the individual as an
“occasional entrant”) unless one of the following applies:
         A.    The individual is the employee of another person, the principal
place of business in which the employee normally works is located in another
municipal corporation in this State that imposes a tax applying to compensation
paid to the individual for services performed on those days, and the individual
is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax on the compensation
paid for such services.
         B.   The individual is a professional entertainer or professional
athlete, the promoter of a professional entertainment or sports event or an
employee of such promoter, all as may be reasonably defined by the Municipality
of Germantown.
      1.   For purposes of the 12-Day Calculation, any portion of a day worked
in the Municipality of Germantown shall be counted as one day worked in the
Municipality of Germantown.
            2.   Beginning with the thirteenth (13th) day, the employer of said
individual shall begin withholding the Municipality of Germantown income tax
from remuneration paid by the employer to the individual, and shall remit the
withheld income tax to the Municipality of Germantown in accordance with
Section
181.06 of the Income Tax Ordinance. Since the individual can no longer be
considered to have been an occasional entrant, the employer is further required
to remit taxes on income earned in the Municipality of Germantown by the
individual for the first twelve days.
            3.   Income tax withheld from an occasional entrant and paid by a
non-resident employer to the Municipality of Germantown is subject to being
refunded only to the municipality in which the employer's principal place of
business is located, and only after the municipality has established that the
employee has a liability to them. However, any tax withheld for the
Municipality of Germantown under the $150 deminimus provision is not subject to
refund even if the employee for which tax was withheld is an occasional
entrant.
      (3)    A.    On the portion attributable to Germantown of the net profits
earned and accrued or received during the effective period of this chapter of
all resident associations, unincorporated businesses, professions or other
entities, derived from sales made, work done, services performed or rendered
and business or other activities conducted in Germantown.
         B.    On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits
earned and accrued or received during the effective period of this chapter of a
resident partner or owner of a resident unincorporated business entity not
attributable to Germantown upon which the tax was not paid by the entity.
         C.    On the portion attributable to Germantown of the net profits
earned and accrued or received during the effective period of this chapter of
all nonresident associations, unincorporated businesses, professions or other
entities, derived from sales made, work done or services performed or rendered
and business or other activities conducted in Germantown, whether or not such
association or other unincorporated business entity has an office or place of
business in Germantown.
         D.    On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits
earned and accrued or received during the effective period of this chapter of a
resident partner or owner of a nonresident association or other unincorporated
business entity not attributable to Germantown on which the tax was not paid by
the entity.
      (4)    On the portion attributable to Germantown of the net profits
earned and accrued or received during the effective period of this chapter of
all corporations derived from sales made, work done, services performed or
rendered and business or other activities conducted in Germantown.
   (b)    The portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer to be allocated
as having been derived from within Germantown, in the absence of actual records
thereof, shall be determined as follows:
      (1)    Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation
percentage to be the average ratio of:
         A.    The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in
Germantown during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include
property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall
be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
         B.    Wages, salaries and other compensation paid or accrued during
the taxable period to persons employed in the business or profession for
services performed in Germantown to wages, salaries and other compensation paid
or accrued during the same period to persons employed in the business or
profession, wherever their services are performed;
         C.    All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within Germantown to purchasers outside Germantown regardless of where
titles passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
   (c)   For the purpose of this section, the taxable base shall be determined
in accordance with Federal tax interpretations, when applicable, and with the
accounting method used by the taxpayer for Federal income taxes adjusted to the
requirements of this chapter. With respect to loss carry forward and business
losses against personal income, the following shall apply:
      (1)    Net operating losses may be carried forward for three (3) years.
No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of
a prior year. Losses shall not be allowed (in whole or in part) to be allocated
to the municipality as loss carry forward if the loss occurred during a time
period in which gross receipts (in whole or in part) were not allocated and
reported to the municipality.
      (2)    In determining income subject to taxation, losses from the
operation of a business or profession cannot be used to reduce wages from
employment or other employment compensation.
   (d)    Consolidated Returns.
      (1)    Any affiliated group which files a consolidated return for Federal
income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code may
file a consolidated return with the Municipality of Germantown. However, once
the affiliated group has elected to file a consolidated return or a separate
return with the municipality, the affiliated group may not change their method
of filing in any subsequent tax year without written approval from the
Municipality of Germantown.
      (2)    Allocation of income and deductions between related taxpayer; in
the case of a corporation that carries on transactions with its stockholders or
with other corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates,
or some other method, or in case any person operates a division, branch,
factory, office, laboratory or activity within Germantown constituting a
portion only of its total business, the Superintendent may require such
additional information as he may deem necessary to ascertain whether net
profits are properly allocated to Germantown. If the Superintendent finds net
profits are not properly allocated to Germantown by reason of transactions with
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or transactions with such division, branch, factory,
office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, he shall make such
allocation as he deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper allocation of
net profits to Germantown.
   (e)    Exceptions. The tax provided for herein shall not be levied upon:
      (1)    Pay or allowances of active members of the Armed Forces of the
United States and of members of their reserve components, including the Ohio
National Guard.

similar payments including disability benefits received from local, State or
Federal governments or charitable, religious or educational organizations.

rental value of a house provided as a part of an ordained minister's
compensation.
      (11)   Alimony paid.

net profits, the taxation of which is prohibited by the United States
Constitution or any act of Congress limiting the power of the State or their
political subdivisions to impose net income taxes on income derived from
interstate commerce.
      (13)    Income, salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation and
net profits, the taxation of which is prohibited by the Constitution of the
State of Ohio or any act of the Ohio General Assembly limiting the power of the
City to impose net income taxes.
         (Ord. 18-22.  Passed 6-4-18.)
181.04  EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Such tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to the income,
salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned and shall be levied
with respect to the net profits of the businesses, professions or other
activities earned and accrued or received from and after April 1, 1976.  (Ord.
01-68.  Passed 1-7-02.)
181.05  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)    Each person 18 years of age or older who engages in business or other
activity or whose income, salary, wage, commission or other compensation is
subject to the tax imposed by this chapter, shall, whether or not a tax be due
thereon, make and file a return on or before April 30 of the year following the
effective date of this chapter, and on or before April 30 of each year
thereafter. When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different
from the calendar year, the return shall be filed within four months from the
end of such fiscal year or period. The Superintendent is hereby authorized to
provide by regulation that the return of an employer or employers, showing the
amount of tax deducted by such employer or employers from the salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation of an employee, and paid by him or them to
the Superintendent may be accepted as the return required of any employee whose
sole income, subject to tax under this chapter, is such income, salaries,
wages, commissions or other compensation.
   (b)    The return shall be filed with the Superintendent on a form or forms
furnished or obtainable upon request from the Superintendent or on other forms
deemed acceptable by the Superintendent setting forth:
      (1)    The aggregate amounts of income, salaries, wages, commissions and
other compensation received by him and gross receipts from business, the
profession or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the
acquisition of such gross receipts earned during the preceding year and subject
to such tax;
      (2)    The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)    Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Superintendent may require.
   (c)    The Germantown Income Tax Department shall accept a generic form of
any return, report or document required to be filed if the generic form once
completed and filed contains all of the information required to be submitted
with the Municipality of Germantown's prescribed returns, reports or documents,
and if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form otherwise
complies with the rules or ordinances of the Municipality of Germantown
governing the filing of returns, reports or documents.
   (d)    Acceptance of Federal Extensions.
      (1)    Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a Federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a Germantown tax
return. The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of the taxpayer's
request for Federal filing extension with the Superintendent of Taxation.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to file a Federal income tax return may
request an extension for filing a Germantown tax return in writing.
      (3)    The request for an extension shall be filed not later than the
last day for filing the Germantown tax return as prescribed by ordinance or
rule of this municipal corporation.
      (4)   A valid extension request extends the due date for filing a return
six (6) months from the original due date of such return.
      (5)   The Superintendent may deny a taxpayer's request for extension if
the taxpayer:
         A.    Fails to timely file the request;
         B.    Fails to file a copy of the federal extension (if applicable);
         C.    Owes the Municipality of Germantown any delinquent income tax or
any penalty, interest, assessment or other charge for the late payment or
nonpayment of income tax;
         D.    Has failed to file any required income tax return, report or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (6)    The granting of an extension for filing a Germantown income tax
return does not extend the last date for payment of the tax; hence, penalty and
interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of extension at the rate
set out by Section
181.10. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements of the tax code have been met. Any extension by
the Superintendent shall be granted with the understanding that declaration
filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further
examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment
requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.
   (e)    (1)    The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Superintendent the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided, however, that credit shall be allowed for:
         A.    Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.06 of this chapter;
         B.    Any portion of such tax which shall have been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.07; and
         C.    Credit to the extent allowed by Section
181.15 for tax paid to another municipality.
      (2)    Subject to the limitations contained in Section
181.11, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which Germantown is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter, may have such overpayment
applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election
indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded.
   (f)   Amended Returns
      (1)    Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Section
181.11. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable upon request from
the Superintendent. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return
without the approval of the Superintendent.
      (2)    Within three months from the final determination of any Federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Germantown tax liability, such taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Germantown return showing income subject to the
Germantown tax based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability and
pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
   (g)    Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the
time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns and the failure to file
such information returns, schedules and statements shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten
days after notification by the Superintendent, or his authorized
representative, to file the items required by this subsection.
   (h)   Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net
loss is subject to the filing requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 01-68.  Passed 1-7-02.)
181.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)    (1)    Each employer shall at the time of the payment of any salary,
wage, commission or other compensation, deduct the tax of one and one quarter
percent (1.25%) beginning November 3, 1987, of the gross salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation due by the employer to his employees who are
subject to the provisions of this chapter. In making such deduction at the time
of payment, the employer shall compute the tax to the nearest full cent so that
mills of five or more shall be increased to the next full cent and mills less
than five shall be dropped. No person shall be entitled to a refund merely
because such rounding off of the tax results in an apparent overpayment based
on his total earnings. Each employer shall, on or before the fifteenth day of
each month, make a return and pay to the Superintendent, the tax withheld
during the preceding month. Provided, however, the Superintendent shall have
the authority to approve the filing of returns and payment of the tax withheld
on a quarterly basis. In such case, the employer shall, on or before the
fifteenth day of each month following the calendar quarters ending March 31,
June 30, September 30 and December 31, make a return and pay to the
Superintendent the tax withheld during the preceding calendar quarter. Such
approval for quarterly filings and payments may be withdrawn by the
Superintendent when it is to the best interests of the City to do so. The
Superintendent shall provide by regulations, the manner in which such approval
is to be granted or withdrawn.
      (2)    The employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required
to be deducted and withheld whether or not such tax has in fact been withheld.
   (b)   Such employer in collecting such tax, shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by such employer to Germantown, as a trustee for
the benefit of Germantown and any such tax collected by such employer from his
employees shall, until the same is paid to Germantown, be deemed a trust fund
in the hands of such employer.
   (c)    No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him exclusively in or about
such person's residence, even though such residence is in Germantown, but such
employee shall be subject to all of the requirements of this chapter.
   (d)   On or before January 31 of each year beginning with the year 1972,
each employer shall file a withholding return on a form prescribed by and
obtainable upon request from the Superintendent, setting forth the names and
addresses of all employees from whose compensation the tax was withheld during
the preceding calendar year and the amount of tax withheld from his employees
and such other information as may be required by the rules and regulations
adopted by the Superintendent.
   (e)    All employers that provide any contractual service within the
Municipality and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with that service,
shall provide the Municipality the names and addresses of the subcontractors.
The subcontractors shall be responsible for all income tax withholding
requirements under this chapter.
(Ord. 01-68.  Passed 1-7-02.)
181.07  DECLARATIONS.
   (a)    Every person who anticipates the receipt of any taxable income which
is not subject to Section
181.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
subject to the tax imposed by Section
181.03, shall file a declaration setting forth such person's estimated taxable
income together with any estimated tax due thereon, if any; provided, however,
if a person's income is wholly from wages from which the tax will be withheld
and remitted to Germantown in accordance with Section
181.06, such person need not file a declaration.
   (b)    (1)    Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 30 of each
year during the life of this chapter, except that no penalties or interest
shall be assessed, for not filing a declaration, on any resident taxpayer who
was not domiciled in the Municipality on the first day of January of the year
in which they became subject to estimated payments, nor shall penalties or
interest be assessed on estimated payments if the taxpayer has remitted an
amount equal to one hundred percent of the previous year's tax liability,
provided that the previous year reflected a twelve-month period.
      (2)    Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration within four months after the beginning of each fiscal year or
period.
   (c)   (1)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by or
obtainable upon request from the Superintendent. Credit shall be taken for the
Germantown tax to be withheld from any portion of such income to determine the
estimated tax due. In accordance with the provisions of Section
181.15, credit may be taken for tax to be paid to or to be withheld and
remitted to another taxing municipality.
      (2)    The original declaration, or any subsequent amendment thereof, may
be amended at any time.
      (3)    An amended declaration must be filed on or before January 31 of
the following year, or in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal year, on or before
the date fixed by regulation of the Superintendent if it appears that the
original declaration made for such taxable year underestimated the taxpayer's
income by thirty percent (30%) or more. At such time a payment which, together
with prior payments, is sufficient to pay the  taxpayer's entire estimated
liability shall be made. If upon the filing the return required by Section
181.05, it appears that the taxpayer did not pay ninety percent (90%) of his
tax liability, as shown on such return, on or before January 31, or the date
fixed by regulations, whichever is applicable, the difference between ninety
percent (90%) of such taxpayer's tax liability and the amount of estimated tax
actually paid on or before January 31, or the date fixed by regulation,
whichever is applicable, shall be subject to the interest and penalty
provisions of Section
181.10. An exception will be made if one hundred percent (100%) of the prior
year tax liability has been paid in equal quarterly installments in the current
year.
   (d)    (1)    Such declaration of net estimated tax to be paid Germantown by
taxpayers who are individuals shall be accompanied by a payment of at least
one- fourth of ninety percent (90%) of the estimated annual tax, less credit,
and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the last day of the
seventh, tenth and thirteenth months after the beginning of the taxable year.
Provided, however, that in case and amended declaration has been filed, the
unpaid balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (2)    Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid Germantown by
corporations and associations shall be accompanied by a payment of at least one
fourth of 90% of the estimated annual tax and at least a similar amount shall
be paid on or before June 15, September 15 and December 15. In the case of a
fiscal year taxpayer the second, third, and fourth quarter payments shall be
due on the fifteenth day of the sixth, ninth and twelfth months of the taxable
year, respectively.
      (3)   Provided further, however, that the last-quarterly payment of
estimated tax need not be made if the taxpayer files his final return and pays
the balance of the tax due thereon within forty-five days following the end of
his taxable year.
   (e)    On or before the last day of the fourth month of the calendar or
fiscal year following that for which such declaration or amended declaration
was filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due
Germantown shall be paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
181.05.
(Ord. 01-68.  Passed 1-7-02.)
181.08  DUTIES AND POWERS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF TAXATION.
   (a)   (1)    It shall be the duty of the Superintendent to receive the tax
imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein from the taxpayers; to
keep an accurate record thereof; and to report daily all moneys as received.
      (2)    It shall be the duty of the Superintendent to enforce payment of
all taxes owing Germantown, to keep accurate records for a minimum of six years
showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration and/or
make any return, including taxes withheld, and to show the dates and amounts of
payments thereof.
   (b)    The Superintendent is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of
Council by motion, to adopt and promulgate and to enforce rules and regulations
relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection of taxes and
administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including
provisions for the reexamination and correction of returns.
   (c)    In any case where a taxpayer or employer has failed to file a return
or has filed a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the
Superintendent may assess the amount of tax appearing to be due, together with
interest and penalties thereon, if any, in the following manner:
      (1)    General provisions.
         A.    If the Superintendent determines that any taxpayer subject to
the provisions of this chapter has a tax liability for which he as filed no
return or has filed an incorrect return and has failed to pay the full amount
of tax due, the Superintendent shall issue a proposed assessment showing the
amount of tax due, together with any penalty and interest that may have accrued
thereon.
            1.    Such proposed assessment shall be served upon the taxpayer in
person or by mailing to his last know address. Proof of mailing furnished by
the U.S. Post Office shall be presumptive proof of receipt thereof by the
addressee.
            2.    A taxpayer may, within fifteen days after the date the
proposed assessment was served or mailed, file a written protest with the
Superintendent. Within fifteen days after receipt of the protest, the
Superintendent shall give the protestant an opportunity to be heard; provided
further that the Superintendent may extend the date of hearing for good cause
shown. After the hearing the Superintendent shall withdraw the assessment or he
shall adjust or reaffirm the assessment and it shall then become final. If no
protest is filed as herein provided, such proposed assessment shall become
final fifteen days after being served.
         B.    After a proposed assessment becomes final, notice of such final
assessment shall be issued and shall be served in the same manner as a proposed
assessment.
            1.    A taxpayer shall have thirty days after the date the final
assessment was served or mailed within which to file written notice of appeal
with the Board of Tax Appeals. Such written notice of appeal shall be filed in
a sealed envelope plainly marked "Appeal to Board of Tax Appeals" and mailed or
delivered to the Superintendent who shall deliver such appeal to the Chairman
of the Board of Tax Appeals, or, if the Chairman is not available, to the Vice-
Chairman.
            2.    The Board of Tax Appeals, upon receipt of a notice of appeal,
shall within fifteen days notify the Superintendent thereof who shall forward
within fifteen days to the Board a certified transcript of all actions taken by
him with respect to such final assessment. Such transcript shall be open to
inspection by the appellant and his counsel. The Board of Appeals shall
schedule a hearing on the appeal within 45 days from the date of the appeal.
(See section
181.13.)
            3.    Any taxpayer against whom a final assessment has been issued
and who has filed a notice of appeal shall be granted a hearing by the Board of
Tax Appeals. At such hearing the appellant and the Superintendent shall be
given opportunity to present evidence relating to the final assessment. After
the conclusion of such hearing, the Board of Tax Appeals shall affirm, reverse
or modify the final assessment and shall furnish a copy of its decision in
respect thereof to the appellant and the Superintendent. The appellant's copy
of  such decision shall be served upon him in the same manner as herein
provided for services of assessments.
         C.    When any taxpayer subject to the provisions of this chapter has
filed a return indicating the amount of tax due and has failed to pay such tax
to the Superintendent as required by this chapter, the Superintendent need not
issue an assessment but may proceed under the provisions of Sections
181.11 and
181.12.
      (2)    Provisions affecting employers.
         A.    If the Superintendent determines that an employer subject to the
provisions of this chapter has failed to file a return for tax withheld and has
failed to pay to the Superintendent the full amount of such taxes, the
Superintendent shall issue a proposed assessment showing the amount of tax due,
together with any penalties and interest that may have accrued thereon, and the
provision of subsections (c)(1)A. and B. hereof shall apply.
         B.    If the Superintendent determines that an employer subject to the
provisions of this chapter has failed to withhold tax, the Superintendent shall
issue a proposed assessment showing the tax due, together with any penalties
and interest that may have accrued thereon, and the provisions of subsections
(c)(1)A. and B. hereof shall apply.
         C.    When an employer subject to the provisions of this chapter has
filed a return indicating the amount of tax withheld and has failed to pay such
tax to the Superintendent as required by this chapter, the Superintendent may
proceed under the provisions of Section
181.11 and
181.12 and need not issue an assessment as provided in subsections (c)(2)A. and
B. hereof.
   (d)    Any taxpayer or employer who does not file a notice of appeal to the
Board of Tax Appeals from a final assessment issued against him shall pay the
amount thereof within  thirty days after service of such final assessment.
   (e)    The Superintendent shall have the authority, when requested by the
taxpayer and for good cause shown, to extend the time of making and filing any
return whenever he deems it necessary so to do, but not to exceed a period of
six months, or one month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the
Internal Revenue Service for the filing of the Federal income tax return.
   (f)    When an application for deferred payment of tax due is filed by a
taxpayer, the Superintendent may authorize partial payments of unpaid taxes
when, in his judgment, the taxpayer is unable, due to hardship conditions, to
pay the full amount of the tax when due, and when, in his judgment, such
deterred payments are the best means of accomplishing the intent of this
chapter. Provided, however, that the Superintendent shall not authorize an
extension of time for the payment of such taxes due for more than six months
beyond the date of the filing of the application.
(Ord. 01-68.  Passed 1-7-02.)
181.09  INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT; PENALTY FOR DIVULGING
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   (a)    The Superintendent, or any authorized employee, is hereby authorized
to examine the books, papers, records and copies of Federal income tax returns
of any employer or of any taxpayer or person subject to, or whom the
Superintendent believes is subject to the provisions of this chapter, for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made, or if no return was made,
to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Every such employer, supposed
employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer, is hereby directed and required to
furnish within ten days following a written request by the Superintendent, or
his duly authorized agent or employee, the means, facilities and opportunity
for making such examinations and investigations as are hereby authorized.
   (b)    The Superintendent is hereby authorized to order any person presumed
to have knowledge of the facts to appear before him and may examine such
person, under oath, concerning any income which was or should have been
returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect such income, and for
this purposes may compel the production of books, papers, records and copies of
Federal income tax returns and the attendance of all personnel before him,
whether as parties or witnesses, whenever he believes such persons have
knowledge of such income or information pertinent to such inquiry.
   (c)    The refusal to produce books, papers, records and copies of Federal
income tax returns, or the refusal to submit to such examination by any
employer or person subject or presumed to be subject to the tax or by any
officer, agent or employee of a person subject to the tax or required to
withhold tax or the failure of any person to comply with the provisions of the
section or with an order or subpoena of the Superintendent authorized hereby
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter, punishable as provided in Section
181.12.
   (d)   Any information gained as the result of any returns, investigations,
hearings or verifications required or authorized by this chapter shall be
confidential, except for official purposes, or except when ordered by a court
of competent jurisdiction. Any person divulging such information in violation
of this chapter, shall, upon conviction thereof, be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine or penalty of not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both.
Each disclosure shall constitute a separate offense.
   In addition to the penalty, any employee of the City who violates the
provisions of this section relative to the disclosure of confidential
information shall be guilty of an offense punishable by immediate dismissal.
   (e)   Every taxpayer shall retain all records necessary to compute his tax
liability for a period of six years from the date his return is filed, or the
withholding taxes are paid.
(Ord. 01-68.  Passed 1-7-02.)
181.10  INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)    All taxes imposed and all monies withheld or required to be withheld
by employers under the provisions of this chapter and remaining unpaid ten days
after they become due shall bear interest at the rate at which interest is paid
on refunds according to Ohio R.C. 5702.47, and updated annually.
   (b)    In addition to interest as provided in subsection (a) hereof,
penalties are hereby imposed as follows based on the tax remaining unpaid ten
days after they become due:
      (1)    For failure to pay taxes due, other than taxes withheld; one and
one half percent (1 1/2%) per month or fraction thereof.
      (2)    For failure to remit taxes withheld from employees: three percent
(3%) per month or fraction thereof, or ten percent (10%), whichever is greater.
      (3)    Where the taxpayer has failed to file a declaration on which he
has estimated and paid a tax equal to or greater than the tax paid for the
previous year, or has failed to file a declaration on which he was estimated
and paid tax equal to or greater than ninety percent (90%) of the actual tax
for the year, or has failed to file a final return and pay the total tax on or
before the end of the month following the end of his taxable year; ten percent
(10%) of the difference, between ninety percent (90%) of the actual tax for the
year and the amount paid through withholding or declaration.
      (4)    Except in the case of fraud, the penalty shall not exceed fifty
percent (50%) of the unpaid tax.
      (5)   Twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be assessed as an administrative
charge for those taxpayers failing to timely file the annual return or failing
to pay the taxes due.
   (c)    Exceptions. A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax
assessment made by the Superintendent when a return has been filed in good
faith and the tax paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Superintendent
and provided further, that, in the absence of fraud, neither penalty nor
interest shall be assessed on any additional tax assessment resulting from a
Federal audit, providing an amended return is filed and the additional tax is
paid within three months after final determination of the Federal tax
liability.
   (d)    Upon recommendation of the Superintendent, the Board of Tax Appeals
may abate penalty or interest, or both.
   (e)   Provided, however, that in no case shall penalty and interest charges
be levied when the total of such penalty and interest amounts to less than one
dollar ($1.00).
   (f)   Any person required to withhold the tax who knowingly fails to
withhold such tax, or pay over such tax or knowingly attempts in any manner to
evade or defeat such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other
penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of
the tax evaded, or not withheld, or not paid over. No other penalty under this
section shall be applied to any offense to which this penalty is applied.
   (g)    Interest but no penalty will be assessed where an extension has been
granted by the Superintendent and the final tax paid within the period as
extended.
(Ord. 01-68.  Passed 1-7-02.)
181.11  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUND OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)    In addition to any criminal penalties which may be imposed pursuant
to Section
181.12, all taxes imposed by Section
181.03 shall be collectible, together with any interest and penalties thereon,
by civil suit. Except in the case of fraud, omission of twenty-five percent
(25%) or more of income subject to this tax, or failure to file a return, an
additional assessment shall not be made after three years from the time the
return was due or filed, whichever is later. In the case of fraud, omission of
25% or more of income subject to this tax or failure to file a return, all
additional assessments shall be made and all civil actions to recover Municipal
income taxes and penalties and interest thereon shall be brought within six (6)
years after the tax was due or the return was filed whichever is later. In
those cases in which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have
executed a waiver of the Federal statute of limitation, the period within which
an additional assessment may be made by the Superintendent shall be one year
form the time of the final determination of the Federal tax liability.
   (b)    Those officers or employees having control or supervision of, or
charged with, the responsibility of filing the return and making payments for a
corporation or association shall be personally liable for failure to file the
return or pay the taxes and penalties and interest due as required. The
dissolution, bankruptcy or reorganization of any employer does not discharge
the officers' or employees' liability for a prior failure of such business to
file a return or pay the taxes due.
   (c)    Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for
refund is made within three years from the date which such payment was made or
the return was due, or within three months after final determination of the
Federal tax liability, whichever is later.
   (d)    Additional amounts of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall not be
refunded or assessed unless such assessment results from income which the
taxpayer has failed to report.
(Ord. 01-68.  Passed 1-7-02.)
181.12  VIOLATIONS.

association or corporation who can be found within the corporate limits of
Germantown.
   (d)    All prosecutions under this section must be commenced within the time
limit as now or hereafter may by provided by the applicable sections of the
Ohio Revised Code for the prosecution of violations of Municipal income tax
ordinances.

procure a return, declaration or other required form shall not excuse him from
making any information return, return or declaration, from filing such forms,
or from paying the tax.

181.13  BOARD OF TAX APPEALS.

the Board on appeal. Such records are not public records available for the

not meetings of a public body subject to Section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised

an income tax obligation that is subject to appeal as provided in this section,
or in an ordinance or regulation of the Municipality of Germantown, the Tax
Superintendent shall notify the taxpayer at the same time of the taxpayer's
right to appeal the decision and of the manner in which the taxpayer may appeal
the decision.
      (2)    Any person who is aggrieved by a decision of the Tax

unlawful, and shall be filed within thirty (30) days after the Tax
Superintendent has issued the decision.

Codified Ordinances of the Municipality of Germantown is not a sole basis for
appeal.
      (4)    The Board of Tax Appeals shall schedule a hearing within forty-
five (45) days after receiving the request, unless the taxpayer waives a
hearing.
      (5)    If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board and may be represented by an attorney at law, certified

any part thereof. A taxpayer dissatisfied with a decision or filing by the

days from the date of filing of the ruling or decision to which exception is
taken.

181.15  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (a)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in Germantown who receives net
profits, income, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service
compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside
Germantown, if it be made to appear that he/she has paid a Municipal income tax
on the same income taxable under this chapter to another municipality, shall be
allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter.  Such credit shall be
equal to sixty percent (60%) of the amount obtained by multiplying the lower of
the tax rate of such other municipality or of the Municipality of Germantown by

credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this chapter on such income earned
in such other municipality or municipalities where such tax is paid.

to whom, or as to which it is beyond the power of Council to impose the tax
herein provided for. If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter,
or any tax against any individual or any of the several groups specified
herein, is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter and shall not affect or impair any of
the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other parts of this
chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of Council that this chapter
would have been adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence,
clause, section or part thereof not been included herein.

181.17  COLLECTION OF TAX AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.

the punishment of violations of this chapter shall have been fully terminated,
subject to the limitations contained in Sections
181.11 and
181.12.

tax on income and the withholding tax established by this Chapter
182 are deemed to be levied in accordance with, and to be consistent with, the
provisions and limitations of Ohio Revised Code 718 (ORC 718). This Chapter is
deemed to incorporate the provisions of ORC 718.

in or earning or receiving income in the municipal corporation, and shall be
measured by municipal taxable income. The Municipality shall tax income at a
uniform rate. The tax is levied on Municipal Taxable Income, as defined herein.

facilities of the Municipality of Germantown there shall be, and is hereby
levied a tax on income, salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation and
on net profits, as hereinafter provided in Ordinance 1072, passed 3-1-71, and
as subsequently amended from time to time.

182.014 STATEMENT OF  PROCEDURAL  HISTORY;  STATE MANDATED CHANGES TO MUNICIPAL
INCOME TAX.
   (A)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to ORC 718 were enacted by Am
Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to conform to
and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority to impose,
enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance No. 15-71
effective January 1, 2016, enacts Chapter
182 in accordance with the provisions of ORC 718 to allow the Municipality to
continue the income tax and withholding tax administration and collection
efforts on behalf of the Municipality.
(Ord. 15-71.  Passed 11-30-15.)
182.02  EFFECTIVE DATE.

182 apply to taxable years beginning 2016 and all succeeding taxable years.
   (B)   Ordinance No. 15-71   does not repeal the existing Chapter

182.03  DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same  meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the
United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio
Revised Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in
this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a
comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of
the Ohio Revised Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall  include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (1)   "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation

income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (A)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)   Add an amount equal to five percent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal

payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal  corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding

withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be

responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure

dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the

the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.

         (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
         (b)   The employee performed services at one or more presumed worksite
locations in the Municipality. For the purposes of this division, "presumed

this state at which the employer provides services that can reasonably be
expected by the employer to last more than twenty days in a calendar year.
Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last more than twenty
days" if either of the following applies at the time the services commence:
            (i)   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to

         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
182.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick

         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax  on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)   Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of section
182.051 of this Chapter.

182.053 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
   (A)   The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino operator,
as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and Section
3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales agent
conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to withhold and
remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages
as provided in this section.
   (B)   If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by Section

for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall
file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the Municipality,
providing the name,  address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar

      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino  business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any

until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by Section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

   (E)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.

deducted and  withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize
award the person's name, address, and social security number in order to
facilitate the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file  a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with Section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of  a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld  as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under  this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;

   (I)      Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed    as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the

Section
182.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
182.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
182.03(1) of this Chapter.

APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
182.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in  writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

requested  alternative  method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request
in an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court- martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from

sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from  real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal

resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a  real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a  municipal  corporation 
that  imposes  a  municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit
from all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may  claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
182.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
182.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than  the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax
were the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.

taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in

income tax in that taxable year and if  the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.

         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
 182.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the

the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as  a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis

estimated payment    was required to be made to the date on which the payment
is made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or
before any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous
underpayment only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the
amount of the payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty

the same income taxable under this chapter to another municipality, shall be
allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter.  Such credit shall be

compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has

cumulative basis as compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions in connection with the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or  more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this 
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any  portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of

tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted
average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be  allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the  benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.  (Ord. 15-71.  Passed 11-30-15.)

under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
182.081 of this Chapter.  (Ord. 15-71.  Passed 11-30-15.)

limitation on refunds as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery  by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
182.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.

      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
182.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section   
182.091 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For  taxable  years  beginning  after  2015,  the  Municipality 
shall  not  require  a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the
amount due is ten dollars or less.

before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment

"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover,  the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account

circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.

or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the  information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax

generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.

signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a

meaning as in Section
182.052 of this Chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts  with the affidavit or if the circumstances
described in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity
which results in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other
activity that results in municipal taxable income reportable to the
Municipality in the taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility  of the
taxpayer to comply with the provisions of this chapter relating to the
reporting and filing of municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income
tax return, even if an affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for
the taxable year. Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax
administrator from performing an audit of the person.

as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to

otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.

tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.

the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.

filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the

      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be

provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the

facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
182.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not  reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially  denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18 of this Chapter.

any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in

182.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by 
the  Tax  Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or  other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for  a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period,  or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 15-71.  Passed 11-30-15.)
182.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the  identifying information.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
182.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 of this Chapter for a violation of Section
182.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 15-71.  Passed 11-30-15.)
182.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or  the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-71.  Passed 11-30-15.)
182.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or  required by municipal corporation ordinance
or state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator,  or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or  the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 15-71.  Passed 11-30-15.)
182.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in  the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or  the date on which a court issues an
opinion establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal
statutes or regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)    If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent  facts 
or  omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
182.15 of this Chapter. 
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the  opinion  shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 15-71.  Passed 11-30-15.)
182.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or  other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)     A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in    this division. A person disputing the presumption of
delivery and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that  the address to which the assessment was
sent was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division    (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 15-71.  Passed 11-30-15.)
182.18  LOCAL  BOARD  OF  TAX  REVIEW;  APPEAL  TO  LOCAL  BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality. Two members shall be
appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality, and may not be
employees, elected officials, or contractors with the Municipality at any time
during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official
of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but
may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax
Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the  number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall  notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed  within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final  determination as provided in Section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not  public records
available for inspection under Section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to Section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 15-71.  Passed 11-30-15.)
182.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)      (a)     Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this 
section  may  be  extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the
employer, agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to
the extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the
time limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any  subsequent 
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth  day after the date on which the final determination of the Local
Board of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or
ultimately reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole
or in part, or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)     If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected    by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the  appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
182.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that  tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
   (F)   The Law Director or the Law Director's designee shall have the power
to compromise any civil matter arising under this tax ordinance.
(Ord. 15-71.  Passed 11-30-15.)
182.20  ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Municipality,
pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator, to adopt
rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet. 
(Ord. 15-71.  Passed 11-30-15.)
182.21  FILING NET PROFIT TAXES; ELECTION TO BE SUBJECT TO R.C. 718.80 TO
718.95.
   (A)    A taxpayer may elect to be subject to sections
182.21 to
182.36 of the Codified Ordinances Chapter
182 in lieu of the provisions set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon the taxpayer's
election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)    The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator
of the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in
182.062 of the Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)    The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, sections
182.21 to
182.36 of the Codified Ordinances, and any applicable provision of Chapter 5703
of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the tax commissioner and the Municipality, on a form prescribed by
the tax commissioner.
      (2)   (a)    The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the tax commissioner and the Municipality of its
termination of the election.
         (b)    A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)    Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to sections
182.21 to
182.36 of the Codified Ordinances, and is instead subject to the provisions set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (C)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer sections
182.21 to
182.36 of the Codified Ordinances. In addition to any other powers conferred

      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.

that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code and Section
182.13 of the Municipality of the Codified Ordinances.  (Ord. 18-08.  Passed 3-
19-18.)
182.22  DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
182.21 to
182.36 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and section
182.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in sections
182.21 to
182.36 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in sections
182.21 to
182.36 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section
182.03 (a) of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017
net operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
section
182.03 (1) of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
section
182.063 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of section
182.063 of the Codified Ordinances.
         If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity
that has made the election described in division (47)(B) of section
182.03 of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (23)(D) of section
182.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
         Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing
the taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed
as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes
of federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section
182.03 (47) of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
182.09 to
182.092 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal
income taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
182.21 to
182.36 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
182.03 (2) (A) of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 18-08.  Passed 3-19-18.)
182.23 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the municipal corporation and that has made the election under
section
182.062
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipal corporation to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the
business or profession, wherever the individual's services are performed,
excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
section
182.052 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the municipal
corporation to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the municipal corporation, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner
may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
182.19 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of section
182.19 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title
passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal
corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the
real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to municipal corporation based
upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in municipal corporation to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of section
182.03 of the Codified Ordinances by municipal corporation or substantially
similar provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation,
the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the
taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to municipal corporation. In no case
shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to
municipal corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee
would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not
exempted from taxation.
      This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to
the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to municipal
corporation under this section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

section
182.062 of the Codified Ordinances. The tax administrator shall review these
returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to
divisions (B) and (C) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer

prescribed by the commissioner and shall include any information that forms the
basis for the referral.
      (2)    If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, municipal corporation reserves its
right to pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure
that the correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord. 18-08.  Passed 3-19-18.)
   
182.25  FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

on a form and in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable

      (2)    If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one
calendar year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to

information.
         (b)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission

   (D)   (1)   (a)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall

commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with Chapter

person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to

tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
182.062 of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of section
182.063 of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under section
182.062 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall

determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner

   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
182.03 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
182.03 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
182.062 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
182.062 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in section
182.062 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
182.062 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit
from" appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of
corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.

sections
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is

having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;

and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 18-08.  Passed 3-19-18.)
182.30  ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a
penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
182.062 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax
required to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty
equal to fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
182.091 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.  (Ord. 18-08.  Passed 3-19-18.)
182.31  ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
182.096 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by sections
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
182.096 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section. 
(Ord. 18-08.  Passed 3-19-18.)
182.32  REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of section
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 18-08.  Passed 3-19-18.)
182.33  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
182.062 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
182.096 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to
the requirements of that section. An application filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the
time prescribed in section
182.096 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.  (Ord. 18-08.  Passed 3-19-18.)
182.34  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
182.062 to
182.10 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

tax year to which the credit is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the municipal corporation and taxpayer under section
182.064 or
182.065 of the Codified Ordinances,, or to modify the terms or conditions of

Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  However,
if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner
or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  That
fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction. 
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator.  Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of motor vehicles
that the Chief orders into storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this

location from which it was removed, the date and time of the removal, the
telephone number of the person from whom it may be recovered, and the address
of the place to which it has been taken and from which it may be recovered. 
The Chief of Police shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular motor vehicle to any person who, either in person or pursuant
to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor
vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under
subsection (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law
enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person who
identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests
information pertaining to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both
of the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 or, if the

vehicle removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the vehicle, the
towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle shall give the
owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio R.C.
4513.611.
      (2)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.60)
303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.  If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
         C.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times, the
times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
         D.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of
the following:
         A.   It is located within twenty-five linear miles of the location of
the private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to
a place of storage within twenty-five linear miles.
         B.   It is well-lighted.
         C.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly scheduled
route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public
transportation is available in the municipal corporation or township in which
the private tow-away zone is located.
   (b)   (1)   If a vehicle is parked on private property that is established
as a private tow- away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in Ohio R.C. 4505.101.  The owner or lienholder of a
vehicle that has been removed under this section, subject to subsection (c) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with subsection (g) of this
section.
      (2)   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be  licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken
under this section.  The towing service shall retain the photographs and the
record of the time and date, in electronic or printed form, for at least thirty
days after the date on which the vehicle is recovered by the owner or
lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
         D.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may be
recovered;
         E.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be recovered.
      (2)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed
from private property in the Chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a
private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular vehicle to a person who, either in person or pursuant to a
telephone call, identifies self as the owner, operator or lienholder of the
vehicle, and requests information pertaining to the vehicle.
   (f)   (1)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three days of the removal, the towing service or
storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause a search
to be made of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle.  The Registrar
of Motor Vehicles shall insure that such information is provided in a timely
manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if
the vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last known
address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested or by a
commercial carrier service utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed
receipt;
         B.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed thirty days after the first
notice is sent, in the manner required under subsection (f)(1)A. of this
section;
         C.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed forty-five days after the first
notice is sent, in the manner required under subsection (f)(1)A. of this
section.
      (2)   Sixty days after any notice sent pursuant to subsection (f)(1) of
this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under
subsection (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101, may initiate the process for obtaining a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle as provided in that section.
      (3)   A towing service or storage facility that does not receive a signed
receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible, shall not
obtain, and shall not attempt to obtain, a certificate of title to the motor
vehicle under division (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101.
      (4)   With respect to a vehicle concerning which a towing service or

vehicle all photographs taken under subsection (d) of this section.  Upon
request, the towing service or storage facility shall provide a copy of all
photographs in the medium in which the photographs are stored, whether paper,
electronic, or otherwise.
      (3)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle

vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.

PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two consecutive hours without the permission of the person having
the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.  (ORC
4513.64)
303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while

   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which

violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).

Director of Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender

violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

assemblies during that calendar year may be filed with the Manager at least
sixty and not more than 180 days before the date and time at which the first

      (4)   The route to be traveled, including the staring point and the
termination point;
      (5)   The approximate number of persons who, and animals and vehicles
which will constitute such  parade or public assembly and the type of animals
and description of the vehicles;

public assembly;
      (9)   The time at which units of the parade or public assembly will begin
to assemble at any such area;
      (10)   If the parade or public assembly is designed to be held by, or on
behalf of, any person other than the applicant, the applicant for such permit

to apply for the permit on his behalf;
      (11)   The type of public assembly, including a description of activities

administrative costs of processing the permit shall be paid to the Municipality
by the applicant when the application is filed.
   (b)   If the application is for the use of any municipal property or if any
municipal services shall be required for the parade or public assembly, the
applicant shall pay, prior to the issuance of a permit, the charges for those
services in accordance with a schedule of service costs approved by Council. 
(Ord. 99-44.  Passed 7-6-99.)
309.06  POLICE PROTECTION.
   (a)   The Chief of Police shall determine whether and to what extent
additional police protection is reasonably necessary for the parade or public
assembly for traffic control and public safety.  The Chief of Police shall base
this decision on the size, location, duration, time and date of the event, the
expected sale or service of alcoholic beverages, the number of streets and
intersections blocked, and the need to detour or preempt citizen travel and use
of the streets and sidewalks.  The speech content of the event shall not be a
factor in determining the amount of police protection necessary.  If possible,
without disruption of ordinary police services or compromise of public safety,
regularly scheduled on-duty personnel will police the event.  If additional
police protection for the public assembly is deemed necessary by the Chief of
Police, he or she shall so inform the applicant of the permit.  The applicant
then shall have the duty to secure the police protection deemed necessary by
the Chief of Police at the sole expense of the applicant.
   (b)   Persons engaging in parades or public assemblies conducted for the
sole purpose of public issue speech protected under the First Amendment are not
required to pay for any police protection provided by the Municipality.  (Ord.
99-44.  Passed 7-6-99.)
309.07  STANDARDS FOR ISSUANCE.
   (a)   The Manager shall issue a permit as provided for herein when, from a
consideration of the application and from such other information as may
otherwise be obtained, the Manager finds that:
      (1)   The conduct of the parade or public assembly will not substantially
interrupt the safe and orderly movement of other pedestrian or vehicular
traffic contiguous to its route or location;
      (2)   The conduct of the parade or public assembly will not require the
diversion of so great a number of police officers to properly police the line
of movement and the areas contiguous thereto as to prevent normal police
protection of the Municipality;
      (3)   The concentration of persons, animals, and vehicles at public
assembly points of the parade or public assembly will not unduly interfere with
proper fire and police protection of, or ambulance service to, areas contiguous
to such public assembly areas;
      (4)   The conduct of the parade or public assembly is not reasonably
likely to cause injury to persons or property;
      (5)   The parade or public assembly is scheduled to move from its point
of origin to its point of termination expeditiously and without unreasonable
delays en route;
      (6)   Adequate sanitation and other required health facilities are or
will be made available in or adjacent to any public assembly areas;
      (7)   There are sufficient parking places near the site of the parade or
public assembly to accommodate the number of vehicles reasonably expected;
      (8)   The applicant has secured the police protection, if any, required
under Section
309.06;
      (9)   Such parade or public assembly is not for the primary purpose of
advertising any product, goods or event that is primarily for private profit,
and the parade itself is not primarily for profit.  The prohibition against
advertising any product, goods or event shall not apply to signs identifying
organizations or sponsors furnishing or sponsoring exhibits or structures used
in the parade;
      (10)   No parade or public assembly permit application for the same time
and location is already granted or has been received and will be granted;
      (11)   No parade or public assembly permit application for the same time
but location is already granted or has been received and will be granted, and
the police resources required for that prior parade or public assembly are so
great that in combination with the subsequent proposed application, the
resulting deployment of police services would have an immediate and adverse
effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and property; and
      (12)   No event is scheduled elsewhere in the Municipality where the
police resources required for that event are so great that the deployment of
police services for the proposed parade or public assembly would have an
immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and
property.
   (b)   No permit shall be granted that allows for the erection or placement
of any structure, whether permanent or temporary, on a street, sidewalk, or
right of way unless advance approval for the erection or placement of the
structure is obtained.
(Ord. 99-44.  Passed 7-6-99.)
309.08  NON-DISCRIMINATION.
   The Manager shall uniformly consider each application upon its merits and
shall not discriminate in granting or denying permits under this chapter based
upon political, religious, ethnic, race, disability, sexual orientation or
gender related grounds.
(Ord. 99-44.  Passed 7-6-99.)
309.09  NOTICE OF DENIAL OF APPLICATION.
   The Manager shall act promptly upon a timely filed application for a parade
or public assembly permit but in no event shall grant or deny a permit less
than forty-eight hours prior to the event.  If the Manager disapproves the
application, he or she shall notify the applicant either by personal delivery
or certified mail at least forty-eight hours prior to the event of his or her
action and state the reason for denial.  (Ord. 99-44.  Passed 7-6-99.)
309.10  ALTERNATIVE PERMIT.
   (a)   The Manager, in denying an application for a parade or public assembly
permit, may authorize the conduct of the parade or public assembly at a date,
time, location, or route different from that named by the applicant.  An
applicant desiring to accept an alternate permit shall, within five days after
notice of the action of the Manager, file a written notice of acceptance with
the Manager.
   (b)   An alternate parade or public assembly permit shall conform to the
requirements of, and shall have the effect of,  a parade or public assembly
permit issued under this chapter.
(Ord. 99-44.  Passed 7-6-99.)

   (a)   Any applicant shall have the right to appeal the denial of a parade or
public assembly permit to Council.  The denied applicant shall make the appeal
within five days after receipt of the denial by filing a written notice with
the Manager and a copy of the notice with the Clerk of Council.  Council shall
act upon the appeal at the next scheduled meeting following receipt of the
notice of appeal.
   (b)   In the event that Council rejects an applicant’s appeal, the applicant
may file an immediate request for review with a court of competent
jurisdiction.

313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,

analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.

violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.

sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense

subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.

As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to

privileges with an ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may
reduce the period of suspension as authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.  If the

R.C. 2929.28, in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s indigent drivers’ alcohol
treatment fund.
   (l)   Appeal Does Not Stay Operation of License Suspension.  If a person
whose driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended under this section files an appeal regarding
any aspect of the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay
the operation of the suspension.
   (m)   Subsection (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s

concentration of alcohol.
   (o)   Conflict of Terms.  All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

to, the fact that the employer, school official, or official affiliated with a
religious event provided the holder of a  probationary driver’s license with
the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve
as the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section,

accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or

holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection.  In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted.  If a person is convicted of,
pleads guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a
second or subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the
violation may terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this
division.

determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of

   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of

violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct.  However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated

liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was
issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant
restraining device unless the physician or chiropractor, in issuing the
affidavit, acted in a manner that constituted willful, wanton or reckless
misconduct.
      (7)   The Registrar shall adopt rules in accordance with Ohio R.C.
Chapter 119, establishing a process for a person to be included in the database
under subsection (c)(5) of this section.  The information provided and included
in the database under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not a public record
subject to inspection or copying under Ohio R.C. 149.43.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on
any street or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on
any street or highway for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation

person to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of subsection (b)(1) or (3) or the failure of a
person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2)  of
this section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort
action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.  But the trier of
fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of
evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that  could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.     It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the
occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be
fined thirty dollars ($30.00).

subsection (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
subsection (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates subsection (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
 
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
 
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
 
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

531.02  ABATEMENT PROCEDURE.
   Whenever the Building Inspector or Zoning Compliance Officer hereafter
called “Officer” suspects the existence of a public nuisance in the
Municipality, the Officer shall promptly cause to be inspected the premises on
which the Officer suspects such public nuisance exists. Should the Officer find
that a public nuisance does exist, the Officer shall promptly notify the Fire
Chief and the Montgomery County Board of Health or the duly authorized
representative of the Board. Whereupon the Fire Chief and an authorized
representative of the Board shall cause to be inspected the premises on which
it is suspected such public nuisance exists. Written reports of the inspection
and of their findings with respect to the existence of the public nuisance
shall be filed with the Officer.
   Should all of the aforesaid officers or their duly authorized agents concur
that a public nuisance exists, it shall be the duty of the Officer to cause
photographs of such nuisance to be made and to file and keep in the Officer’s
office the written reports of the findings of such officials or their agents.
The Officer shall cause a written notice to be served on the owner stating the
findings with respect to the existence of a public nuisance and stating that
unless the owner causes the abatement of the public nuisance by removal of the
building or structure, the same shall be abated by the Municipality at the
expense of the owner. Such abatement shall begin within fifteen days after
service of the notice and shall be complete within forty-five days or such
additional time as the Officer may deem necessary to complete the removal.

requested. If service of the written notice is not perfected by any of the
hereinbefore described methods, then the Officer shall cause such notice to be
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the Municipality, once each
week for two consecutive weeks, and shall further cause a copy of the notice to
be left with the person, if any, in possession of the premises on which it is
alleged such public nuisance exists, or if there is no person in possession
thereof, he shall cause a copy of the notice to be posted on the premises. The

fifteen days after receipt of notice or such additional time as the Officer may
deem necessary to complete plans and specifications, not to exceed ninety days.
   The Officer shall, upon approval of the plans and specifications, cause a
special building permit to be issued to the owner. The special building permit
to be issued by the Officer shall be for a period of thirty days and within
such thirty days the owner will effect and complete repairs and/or
replacements, unless the Officer grants an extension to the special building
permit. Such extension shall be granted if the owner shows reason or cause for
it and if it will more readily effect the repairs and/or replacements.
(Ord. 95-33.  Passed 6-19-95.)
531.05  APPEALS.
   The owner may, within ten days after completion of service of the notice,

whether in fact a public nuisance exists. The hearing shall be held within ten
days following receipt of the written demand and at least two days notice in
writing of the hearing shall be given to the owner. The hearing shall be
conducted by a hearing board composed of the Mayor, the Manager and the Law
Director. All members of the hearing board must concur that a public nuisance
exists before enforcement of the abatement is carried out. A copy of the
decision of the hearing officers shall be promptly served upon the owner in the
manner provided for in Section
531.02.  (Ord. 95-33.  Passed 6-19-95.)
531.06  ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE BY MUNICIPALITY; COSTS.
   (a)    Should the owner not make an application for a special building
permit within ten days after being served notice or fail to file an appeal
pursuant to Section
531.05 or should the nuisance not be abated at the expiration time stated in
the special building permit issued by the Officer or such additional time as
the hearing board may grant, the Manager is authorized, at any time thereafter,
to enter upon the premises, and the owner shall permit him entry, to abate the
nuisance by demolition and removal of the structure or by taking any other such
action as may be required.
   (b)    In abating such nuisance the Manager may call upon any department of
the Municipality for whatever assistance may be necessary, or may, by private
contract, obtain the abatement thereof, and the cost of such private contract
shall be paid for from Municipal funds specifically authorized by Council in
order to abate such public nuisances.

purpose;

museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

545.02  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.

545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05 ,

545.08 ,
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15  or
545.20  involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05  or
545.15  involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05  that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05 ,
545.06  or
545.08 , Section
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15  or
545.20 , whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single

duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

License shall be non-transferrable to any other Mobile Food Vendor or location
not approved as part of the License application.

Section and all applicable laws.

Municipality may require.

   (a)   Not sooner than forty-five nor later than sixty days after the end of
each calendar quarter, a video service provider shall pay a video service
provider fee to the Village. The fee shall be calculated quarterly by

specified in subsection (c)(1) or (2) hereof.
   (b)   Gross revenue shall be computed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

the calendar quarter that is collected by the provider for video service from
all its subscribers having service addresses within the Village:

means the net revenue received by the video service provider for advertising on
its subscription-based video service within the Village. If such revenue is
derived under a regional or national compensation contract or arrangement

determined by multiplying the total net revenue received by the video service
provider under the contract or arrangement by the percentage resulting from
dividing the number of subscribers in the Village by the total number of
regional or national subscribers that potentially receive the advertising under
the contract or arrangement.
      (2)    Gross revenue shall not include any of the following:
         A.   Any taxes, fees, or assessments that are collected by the video
service provider from video service subscribers for pass-through to any

provider fee authorized under this section. The fee authorized under Ohio R.C.

part of which are written off as bad debt but subsequently collected, less the
expenses of their collection shall be included in gross revenue in the quarter
collected;
         C.   Late payment charges;
         D.   Maintenance charges;
         E.   Charges for services other than video service, reasonably
identifiable on books or records the video service provider keeps  in the
regular course of business or by other reasonable means, that are aggregated or
bundled with amounts billed to video service subscribers, including, but not
limited to, any revenue received by a video service provider or its affiliates
for telecommunications service, information service, or the provision of
directory or internet advertising, including yellow pages, white pages, banner
advertising, and electronic publishing;
         F.   Reimbursement by programmers of marketing costs actually incurred
by the video service provider;
         G.   Any revenue not expressly enumerated in subsection (b)(1) hereof.
   (c)   (1)    If in a calendar quarter a franchise fee is payable by a
provider under a franchise in effect in the Village, the percentage of gross
revenue payable in that calendar quarter by the video service provider to the
Village shall be the same percentage of gross revenue payable in that calendar
quarter pursuant to that franchise, not to exceed five percent.
      (2)    Otherwise, the percentage shall be five (5) percent of a video
service provider's gross revenues, as calculated in accordance with this
chapter.
   (d)   A video service provider that pays a video service provider fee
pursuant to this section may identify and collect the amount of that fee as a
separate line item on the regular bill of each of its video service subscribers
that has a service address within any portion of the Village.
   (e)   (1)    At its sole expense and not more often than once per calendar
year, the Village or its designee may conduct an audit for the purpose of
verifying the accuracy of a video service provider's calculation of the video
service provider fees it paid to the Village in the audit period. For the
purpose of the audit, the video service provider shall make available for
inspection, at the location where such records are kept in the normal course of
business, those records pertaining to its gross revenue as defined in Section

(Ord. 89-1.  Passed 1-17-89.)
RULES REGARDING UTILITY BILL ADJUSTMENTS
      (1)   Purpose.  It is the intent of the City to accurately bill consumers
for services rendered and to attempt to ensure the financial integrity of the
utilities of the City. These regulations are established pursuant to Codified
Ordinances Section
919.08(g), in order to establish a procedure whereby a consumer may question
his utility bill.
      (2)    Consumer may request reread.  The initial procedure for a consumer
to question his utility bill shall constitute a request that the meter reading
be verified. The consumer may make such a request verbally or in writing at the
Municipal Building during normal business hours. A City employee shall then be
scheduled to verify the reading as soon as possible after receipt of the
request. The consumer should then contact the Municipal Building for
verification of the accuracy of the bill. In the event that the meter reading
is judged to be in error by the designated collection agent of the City, an
adjustment shall be made to the water and sewer charges to correct the error.
In the event that the meter reading is judged to be accurate, the utility bill
shall remain due and payable in full.  (Ord.  1031.  Passed 3-16- 70.)
      (3)    Meter tests.  A consumer may request the accuracy of the water
meter be verified. In the event that the meter is three-fourths of an inch (3/
4") or smaller, the City shall test the meter against a factory calibrated and
certified meter. Larger meters shall be tested at a competent testing facility.
The meter shall be tested at both a slow flow and fast flow rate and shall be
judged to be accurate if it is within one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) of one
hundred percent (100%). This standard has been established by the American
Water Works Association which is a professional society of water utility
managers and operators. In addition to the meter tests, an air test shall be
applied to the occupant's plumbing to ensure that a higher reading has not been
obtained due to faulty plumbing. If the meter is reading accurately or less
than ninety-eight and one-half percent (98-1/2%) of actual consumption,
regardless of the results of the air test, the consumer shall be liable for a
twenty-five dollar ($25.00) service charge. If the test should prove that the
meter is registering more than one hundred one and one-half percent (101-1/2%)
of actual consumption, the bill for the current quarter shall be adjusted by
the collection agent and there shall be no service charge for the meter test or
the air test. In the event that a consumer has a leak in the service line
between a meter pit and their structure or where it can be otherwise verified
that the water does not enter the sanitary sewer, the sewer charge shall be
adjusted upon request by the customer based upon the average of the previous
four quarters of consumption.
         (Ord.  02-53.  Passed 11-4-02.)
      (4)    Appeal to Manager.  In the event that the facts surrounding the
reread, meter test or air test are in dispute, a consumer may request a meeting
with the Manager to attempt to establish the facts of the situation. In the
event that a factual error has been made, the Manager shall order the tests to
be repeated. Upon establishment of the facts, the Manager may adjust the
utility bill as he deems appropriate. However, in no event shall the Manager
adjust a utility bill without some factual evidence that would establish that
the consumer has not received the service for which he has been billed. If the
consumer is not satisfied with the results of the meeting with the Manager, he
may make an appeal to Council.
      (5)    Appeal to Council.  Utility customers may make a final appeal to
Council for adjustment of their utility bill. The appeal shall be submitted in
writing and shall include a statement regarding appellant's belief regarding
the nature of the alleged inaccurate billing and shall request a specific
amount to be adjusted. The appeal shall be submitted at least three full
working days prior to the next regular or special meeting of Council. Appellant
may then appear before Council or a committee of Council and shall be permitted
to make a statement which would further substantiate his claim. Council may
then consider the appeal and shall render a decision at that meeting or at the
next meeting of Council. The decision of Council shall be final and shall be
entered into the minutes of the regular or special meeting of Council. (Ord.
1031.  Passed 3-16-70.)
   (j)   Overpayment of a final utility bill resulting in a balance of less
than one dollar ($1.00) shall not be refunded and the utility account will be
adjusted accordingly.
(Ord. 11-38.  Passed 9-19-11.)
   (k)    The Manager is authorized to direct the shut off of water to any
premise being serviced by water if the owner/agent who is responsible for the
payment of any water charges refuses to allow admittance of a duly authorized
employee of the Municipality to the premise being served with water for the
purpose of reading water meters, checking for cross-connections, maintenance or
other activity necessary for the proper operation of the municipal water
system.
(Ord. 93-81.  Passed 12-6-93.)
   (l)   Each charge levied pursuant to this chapter is made a lien upon the
corresponding lot, land or premises served by a connection to the water system
of the Municipality, and upon becoming delinquent the water service may be shut
off and the charges shall be certified to the County Auditor, who shall place
such charges on the tax duplicate of the County, along with interest and
penalties allowed by law.  This charge, including interest and penalties, shall
be collected as other taxes are collected. 
(Ord. 14-31.  Passed 4-21-14.)
919.09  TEMPORARY BAN OF WATER USAGE,
   (a)    The Manager subject to Council approval is hereby authorized to ban
on a temporary basis any unnecessary or nonemergency use of water within the
Municipality, including watering of lawns, washing cars and nonemergency
household use.
   (b)    Such temporary bans shall be declared in writing and notice thereof
shall be posted at the Municipal Building and given to the local media.
   (c)    Such temporary ban shall expire at the end of one week unless renewed
by the Manager or his designee and can be terminated by the Manager or his
designee at any time.
   (d)    Anyone who violates such temporary ban shall first be given a
warning, then in the event of a second violation shall be guilty of a minor
misdemeanor and subject to a possible fine of up to one hundred dollars
($100.00) for the second and each subsequent violation.
(Ord. 79-52.  Passed 11-5-79.)

which shall include an approved backflow prevention device.
   (b)   The meter shall be installed and inspected by an employee of the
City's Department of Public Service and the property owner shall be responsible
for the parts necessary to make the installation as well as the labor for

be subject to an inspection by an employee of the Department of Public Service.
   (c)    The meter shall be set in line after the primary meter and shall be
inspected on a periodic basis to determine that no cross connections have been
made to the domestic water line.
   (d)    The meter shall be read in the manner in which the primary meter is
read. The useage for the sprinkling meter shall be deducted from the primary
meter and charged a water rate only.

(Ord. 16-12.  Passed 5-16-16.)
921.11  CONTROL OF WASTEWATER DISCHARGES.
   (a)   If wastewaters containing any substance described in Section
921.10  are discharged or proposed to be discharged into the sewer system of
the City or to any sewer system tributary thereto, the City may:
      (1)   Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater;
      (2)   Require the person or industrial discharger to make modifications
that will reduce or eliminate the discharge of such substances in conformity
with this chapter;
      (3)   Require pretreatment, including storage facilities, or flow
equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable characteristics
or substances so that the discharge will not violate the provisions of this
chapter or any other pretreatment requirements;
      (4)   Require the person making, causing or allowing the discharge to pay
any  additional cost or expense incurred for handling and treating excess loads
imposed on the POTW;
      (5)   Take any other remedial action as may be deemed desirable or
necessary to achieve the purpose of this chapter;
      (6)   Require the person responsible for the discharge or proposed
discharge to apply for and obtain a waste discharge permit authorizing and
limiting the discharge for specific pollutants.
   (b)   Where pretreatment or flow equalization prior to discharge into the
POTW is required, plans, specifications and other pertinent data or information
relating to such pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall first be
submitted to the City for review and approval. Such approval shall not exempt
the discharger from compliance with any other applicable code, ordinance, rule,
regulation or order of any governmental authority. Any subsequent alterations
or additions to such pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall not be made
without due notices to and prior approval of the City.
   (c)   The Director may require any User to provide, install and operate, at
the User's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling,
and flow measurement of the user's discharge to the City sewer system.  The
monitoring facility shall be situated ont eh User's premises and located so
that personnel will have unimpeded access at all times for inspection and
sample collection.  If the facilities are locked, special arrangements shall be
made to allow access.  The sampling and monitoring facilities shall meet the
City's requirements, therefore, construction shall not begin until plans have
been submitted to and approved by the Director.  The Director shall also have
the right to set up monitoring devices at the facilities.  There shall be ample
room in or near such monitoring facilities to allow for additional monitoring
devices.  The monitoring facilities, sampling and flow measuring equipment must
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by and at
the expense of the Industrial User.
   (d)   If pretreatment or control of waste flows is required, such facilities
shall be maintained in good working order and operated as efficiently as
possible by the owner or operator at his or her own cost and expense, subject
to the requirements of these rules and regulations and all other applicable
codes, ordinances and laws.
   (e)   Whenever it shall be necessary, an authorized representative of the
City, upon presentation of identification, may enter upon any property or
premises at reasonable times for the purpose of copying any records required to
be kept under the provisions of this chapter, inspecting any processes or
equipment where wastewater is generated and discharged to the POTW, and
sampling any discharge of wastewater to the POTW.
   (f)   Each industrial user shall provide, at their own cost and expense,
protection from accidental discharges of prohibited materials or other wastes
regulated by this chapter. The Director shall evaluate whether each industrial
user needs a written accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other
action to control Slug Discharges.  The Director may require any User to
develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other
action that may be necessary to control Slug Discharges.  An accidental
discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Director and the POTW of
any accidental or Slug Discharge, as required by this ordinance; and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or Slug
Discharge.  Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (g)   If, for any reason, a person does not comply with or will not be able
to comply with any prohibition or limitation in this chapter, the person
responsible for such discharge shall immediately notify the Director so that
corrective action may be taken to protect the POTW treatment plant. In
addition, a written report addressed to the Director detailing the exact date,
time, and cause of the accidental discharge, and the duration, quantity and
characteristics of the discharge, shall be filed by the responsible person
within five (5) days.
(Ord. 16-12.  Passed 5-16-16.)
921.12  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    All industrial users shall promptly notify the Village in advance of
any substantial changes in the volume or character of pollutants in their
discharge to the POTW including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes
for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR
403.12(p).
   (b)    No industrial user shall increase the use of process water or in any
other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitution
for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or
requirement.
   (c)    All significant industrial users shall notify the POTW immediately of
all discharges that could cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loads.
(Ord. 91-10. Passed 4-15-91.)
   (d)    All industrial users are prohibited from bypassing any pretreatment
facility. Pretreatment facilities are required to be operated at all times.
However, if an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
must give prior notice to the City, at least ten days before the date on which
the bypass is to occur. If the bypass is not anticipated, the industrial user
shall notify the City orally within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the
bypass. This twenty-four hour notice shall be followed within five days with a
written description of the bypass, its cause, duration, (or, if it has not been
corrected, how long it is expected to continue), and what has been done to
rectify the situation.
(Ord. 92-44. Passed 7-20-92.)
921.13  INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER MONITORING AND REPORTING.
   (a)   Discharge Reports.
      (1)   Baseline Monitoring Report. Within 180 days after the effective
date of a categorical pretreatment standard, existing industrial users subject
to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or
scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall be required to submit to the City a
Baseline Monitoring Report (BMR), which contains the information listed below
on a form provided by the City. 
New sources and sources that become industrial users after promulgation of an
applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the City the
BMR which contains the information listed below at least ninety days (90) prior
to commencement of discharge.
         A.   Users described above shall submit the information set forth
below.
            i.   All information required in Section
921.14 (a)(1)A., Section
921.14 (a)(2), Section
921.14 (a)(3)A., and Section
921.14 (a)(6).
         B.   Measurement of pollutants.
            i.   The User shall provide the information required in Section
921.14 (a)(7)A. through D.
            ii.   The User shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
            iii.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists.  If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the User should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream
formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the Pretreatment
Standards.  Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting
data shall be submitted to the Control Authority;
            iv.   The Director may allow the submission of a baseline report
which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information
sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
            v.   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
Discharges to the POTW.
         C.   Compliance Certification.  A statement, reviewed by the User's
Authorized Representative as defined in Section
921.01  and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
Pretreatment Standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
         D.   Compliance Schedule.  If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the Pretreatment Standards, the shortest schedule by which
the User will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be
provided.  The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the
compliance date established for the applicable Pretreatment Standard. 
         E.   Signature and Report Certification.  All baseline monitoring
reports must be certified in accordance with Section
921.13 (a)(8)  and signed by an Authorized Representative as defined in Section
921.01.
      (2)   Ninety-Day Compliance Report. Within ninety days following the date
for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in
the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to pretreatment standards
and requirements shall submit to the City a report, Citycontaining the
information described in
921.14 (a)(6) and
921.13 (a)(1)B.  All compliance reports must be certified in accordance with
921.13 (a(8) and signed by an Authorized Representative as defined in Section
921.01 .
      (3)   Periodic Compliance Reports:  Any user subject to a pretreatment
standard or requirement shall periodically submit to the Director a report
indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are
limited by pretreatment standards or requirements and the estimated average and
maximum daily flows for the reporting period.  In cases where the Pretreatment
Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice (BMP), the user
must submit documentation required by the Director or the Pretreatment Standard
necessary to determine the compliance status of the User.  Such reports shall
be submitted according to the frequency prescribed in the industrial user's
wastewater discharge permit.
         A.   The Director may authorize an Industrial User subject to a
categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated
by a categorical Pretreatment Standard if the Industrial User has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the Discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the Industrial User. [40 CFR 403.12(e)(2)] This
authorization is subject to the following conditions:
            i.   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined
to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical Standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
            ii.   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than 5 years.  The User must submit a new request for the waiver before
the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge
permit.
            iii.   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present,
the Industrial User must provide data from at least one sampling of the
facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility
that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
            iv.   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in
accordance with
921.13 (a)(8). 
            v.   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a
demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from
40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was
used in the analysis.
            vi.   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Director must be
included as a condition in the User's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the User in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the Director for 3 years after expiration of the waiver.
            vii.   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the
User's permit by the Director, the Industrial User must certify on each report
with the statement
921.13 (a)(9) below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its
wastestream due to activities of the Industrial User.
            viii.   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present
or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the User's
operations, the User must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements,
or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the Director, and
notify the Director.
            ix.   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical Pretreatment Standard.
      (4)   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation,
the user shall notify the Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation.  The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation.  The industrial user is not required to
resample if:
         A.   The Director, or its authorized representative, samples the
wastewater discharge of the industrial user at least once per month, or
         B.   The Director, or its authorized representative, performs sampling
at the industrial user between the time when the user performs its initial
sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling.
      (5)   The reports required by this section of this chapter shall be based
upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during
the period covered by the report, which data is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
      (6)   If an industrial user monitors any pollutant more frequently than
required by the City, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the
periodic discharge monitoring report.
      (7)   All sampling and analyses shall be performed in accordance with
procedures contained in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto.
      (8)   The reports required by this section shall be signed by:
         A.   A responsible corporate officer of the industrial user submitting
the reports is a corporation.  A responsible corporate officer means a
president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-president of the corporation in charge
of principal business function, or any other    person who performs similar
policy or decision making functions for the corporation or the manager of one
or more manufacturing, production, or operation facilities, if authority to
sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in accordance with
corporate procedures;
         B.   By a general partner or proprietor if the industrial user
submitting the reports is a partnership or sole proprietorship;
         C.   By a duly authorized representative of the individuals described
in paragraphs A. and B. above.
      (9)   Certification:  All reports and applications required to be filed
under this section shall be signed under the following certification statement:
I certify, under penalty of law, that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted.  Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete.  I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.
   (b)   City Records and Monitoring.
      (1)   All industrial users shall retain and preserve for no less than
three years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports,
correspondence,  and any and all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring,
sampling and chemical analyses made by or on behalf of an industrial user in
connection with its discharge. All records which pertain to materials which are
subject to administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation
activities brought by the City pursuant hereto shall be retained and preserved
by the discharger until all enforcement activities have concluded and all
periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired.
      (2)   Such records shall be made available upon request by the City. A
summary of such data indicating the industrial user's compliance with this
chapter shall be prepared quarterly by the City and submitted to the
Subdistrict.
      (3)   The owner or operator of any premises or facility discharging
industrial wastes into the system may be required to install at his or her own
cost and expense suitable facilities to obtain accurate samples of wastewater
flow into the POTW. Such facilities shall be maintained in proper working order
and kept safe at all times.
      (4)   When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the City
may require installation of separate monitoring facilities for each user. When
there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the City may
require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate
discharge.
      (5)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with City requirements and all
applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (c)   Confidential Information.  Information and data on a user obtained
from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater
discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from inspection and sampling
activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the
user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the City, that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
under applicable State law.  Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data.  When requested and demonstrated by the
user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to
the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report.  Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be
recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public
without restriction.

may serve upon such user a written notice stating the nature of the violation
and providing a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty (30) days, for the
satisfactory correction thereof.
   (b)   If a violation is not corrected by timely compliance, the City may
issue an administrative order requiring any person who causes or allows an
unauthorized discharge to show cause before the City why service should not be
terminated.
   (c)   The City may issue a notice to the industrial user responsible for a
discharge the violates any requirement of this chapter stating that the sewer
service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or
other related appurtenances have been installed or existing treatment
facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated.
   (d)   Legal Action:  Any discharge in violation of the substantive
provisions of this chapter or in order of the City shall be considered a public
nuisance.  If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes
into the POTW contrary to the substantive provisions of this chapter or any
order of the City, the City may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or
equitable relief in the Common Pleas Court of this county.
   (e)   Compliance Schedules:  When, in the opinion of the City, it becomes
necessary for industrial users to install technology or provide additional
operation and maintenance (O&M), to meet any condition of this chapter or
applicable administrative order, the City may require the development of the
shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide this additional
technology or O&M.
      (1)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events.  Under no
circumstances shall any increment exceed nine months.
      (2)   Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the
final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report
to the Director including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment or progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it
expects to comply with the increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the
steps being taken to return to the schedule established.
   (f)   Suspension of service and Discharge Permits:  The City may, for good
cause shown, suspend the wastewater treatment service and the wastewater
discharge permit of a discharger when it appears to the City that an actual or
threatened discharge presents an imminent or substantial danger to the health
or welfare of persons, the environment, or the POTW, or interferes with or
threatens to interfere with the operation or performance of the POTW.  Any
discharger notified of the suspension of wastewater treatment services or their
wastewater discharge permit, shall immediately ease all discharges.  In the
event a user fails to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order,
the City shall take such steps as deemed necessary including severance of the
sewer connection.

continues to violate this chapter, its wastewater discharge permit, or any
order of the City or court of competent jurisdiction, the City may petition the
court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may
be appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the
industrial user.
   (k)   Any person who is found to have violated an order of the City or who
willfully or negligently failed to comply with any provision of this chapter,
and the orders issued hereunder, shall be fined up to one thousand dollars
($1,000) per violation per day.
      (1)   Civil Penalties. Any discharger who is found to have violated any
provision of this chapter, their wastewater discharge permit, or any order of
the City or court of competent jurisdiction shall be subject to the imposition
of a civil penalty of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation. Each
day on which a violation occurs or continues shall be deemed a separate and
distinct violation. In addition to the penalties provided herein, the City may
recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, court reporter's fees and
other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law against the discharger.
      (2)   Criminal Penalties. Any person, or persons who intentionally or
willfully violate any provision of this chapter, their wastewater discharge

noncompliance occurs shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. 
         A.   In determining the amount of an administrative fine, the City
shall consider the magnitude and severity of the violation, the history of past
violations, the economic advantage gained by the violator for causing or
allowing the violation to occur, and affirmative actions taken by the violator
to comply with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   Such fines may be added to the industrial user's sewer service
bill.  The City shall have the same collection remedies that are available to
collect other charges.

individual or for the benefit of any particular parcel of property.  (Ord. 08-
78.  Passed 11-17-08.)
924.05  CONFLICTS, SEVERABILITY, NUISANCES AND RESPONSIBILITY.

   (d)   Failure of the Municipality of Germantown to observe or recognize
hazardous or unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not
relieve the site owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage
resulting therefrom, and shall not result in the Municipality of Germantown,

(Ord. 08-78.  Passed 11-17-08.)
924.07  DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illicit Discharges.  No person shall discharge, or
cause to be discharged, an illicit discharge into the MS4.  The commencement,
conduct, or continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is prohibited
except as described below:
      (1)   Water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration; uncontaminated
pumped ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains;
air conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from fire fighting activities. 
These discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the
Municipality of Germantown to be significant contributors of pollutants to the
MS4.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the Municipality of Germantown
as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Discharges from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment
systems existing prior to January 1, 2007 and permitted by the Montgomery
County Board of Health for the purpose of discharging treated sewage effluent
in accordance with Ohio Administrative Code 3701-29, or other applicable
Montgomery County Board of Health Regulations, until such time as the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency issues an NPDES permitting mechanism for
household sewage treatment systems existing prior to January 1, 2007.  These
discharges are exempt unless such discharges are deemed to be creating a public
health nuisance by the Montgomery County Board of Health.  Discharges from new
or replacement off-lot household sewage treatment systems installed after
January 1, 2007 are not exempt from the requirements of this regulation.
   In compliance with the Municipality of Germantown Storm Water Management
program, discharges from all off-lot discharging household sewage treatment
systems must either be eliminated or have coverage under an appropriate NPDES
permit issued and approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.  When
such permit coverage is available for systems existing prior to January 1,
2007, discharges from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment systems
existing prior to January 1, 2007 will no longer be exempt from the
requirements of this regulation.
   (b)   Prohibition of Illegal Connections.  The construction, use,
maintenance, or continued existence of illegal connections to the MS4 is

connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (2)   A person is considered to be in violation of this regulation if the
person connects a line conveying illicit discharges to the MS4, or allows such
a connection to continue.  (Ord. 08-78.  Passed 11-17-08.)
924.08  MONITORING OF ILLICIT DISCHARGES AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   Establishment of an Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection
Monitoring Program:  The Municipality of Germantown shall establish a program
to detect and eliminate illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4. 
This program shall include the mapping of the MS4, including MS4 outfalls and
household sewage treatment systems; the routine inspection of storm water
outfalls to the MS4, and the systematic investigation of potential residential,
commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities for the sources of any dry
weather flows found as the result of these inspections.
   (b)   Inspection of Residential, Commercial, Industrial, or Institutional
Facilities.
      (1)   The Municipality of Germantown shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to this regulation as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this regulation.

facilities subject to this regulation such devices as are necessary to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility’s storm water discharge, as
determined by the Municipality of Germantown.
      (3)   The Municipality of Germantown shall have the right to require the
facility owner/operator to install monitoring equipment as necessary.  This
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in safe and
proper operating condition by the facility owner/operator at the owner/
operator’s expense.  All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality
shall be calibrated by the Municipality of Germantown to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and reasonable
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the facility’s owner/operator at the written or oral request of the
Municipality of Germantown and shall not be replaced.  The costs of clearing
such access shall be borne by the facility owner/operator.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Municipality access to a
facility subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit discharge
inspection is a violation of this regulation.
      (6)   If the Municipality of Germantown is refused access to any part of
the facility from which storm water is discharged, and the Municipality of
Germantown demonstrates probable cause to believe that there may be a violation
of this regulation, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of
an inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
regulation or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, the Municipality of Germantown may seek issuance of a
search warrant, civil   remedies including but not limited to injunctive
relief, and/or criminal remedies from any court of appropriate jurisdiction.
      (7)   Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility owner/operator.  (Ord. 08-78.  Passed 11-17-08.)
924.09  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Notice of Violation.  When the Municipality of Germantown finds that a
person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this
regulation, the Municipality of Germantown may order compliance by written
Notice of Violation.  Such notice must specify the violation and shall be hand
delivered, and/or sent by registered mail, to the owner/operator of the
facility.  Such notice may require the following actions:
      (1)   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
      (2)   The elimination of illicit discharges or illegal connections;
      (3)   That violating discharges, practices, or operations cease and
desist;
      (4)   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; or
      (5)   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   (b)   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the Notice of Violation shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed.  Said Notice shall further advise
that, should the facility owner/operator fail to remediate or restore within
the established deadline, a legal action for enforcement may be initiated.
   (c)   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation must meet compliance
standards within the time established in the Notice of Violation.
   (d)   Administrative Hearing:  If the violation has not been corrected
pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Notice of Violation, the
Municipality of Germantown shall schedule an administrative hearing to
determine reasons for non-compliance and to determine the next enforcement
activity.  Notice of the administrative hearing shall be hand delivered and/or
sent registered mail.  All Administrative Hearings shall be heard by the Board
of Zoning Appeals.
   (e)   Injunctive Relief:  It shall be unlawful for any owner/operator to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
regulation pursuant to O.R.C. 3709.211.  If an owner/operator has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this regulation, the Municipality of
Germantown may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining
the owner/operator from activities that would create further violations or
compelling the owner/operator to perform abatement or remediation of the
violation.

Economic Development Plan and planning process that is reflected in the
contents of this Zoning Code and in the zoning map of the Municipality by:

specific regulations contained in this Zoning Code control the location,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, and use of buildings, structures, and
land for residence, commerce, industry, or other specific uses.

of lot area on which construction is authorized and a determination of the area
of open space surrounding any man-made improvements upon the land.
   (c)   Facilitating the orderly, efficient, and appropriate growth and
development within the Municipality.
   (d)   Protecting residential, business, commercial, and industrial land uses
from encroachment by incompatible land uses that would not be conducive to the

   (e)   Regulating certain nonconforming uses of land, buildings, and
structures.
   (f)   Promoting a pattern of rational land use relationships among

1125.01  INTENT.
   The intent of this article is to establish zoning districts in order to
realize the general purpose set forth in the Preamble of this Zoning Code, to
provide for orderly growth and development, and to protect the property rights
of all individuals by assuring the compatibility of uses and practices within

incorporated by reference herein, thereby having the same force and effect as
if herein fully described in writing.
   (b)   The official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the
Mayor and Clerk of the Municipal Council. If, in accordance with the provisions
of this Zoning Code, changes are made in district boundaries or other matter
portrayed on the official Zoning Map, these changes shall be made on the

1125.04  INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The following rules shall be used to determine the precise location of any
zoning district boundary unless such boundary is specifically indicated on the
official Zoning Map.
   (a)   Where district boundaries are so indicated as approximately following
the centerlines of streets, or street right-of-way lines, such centerlines,
street lines, or right-of-way lines shall be construed to be said boundaries.
   (b)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately
follow the lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries.
   (c)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately
parallel to the centerlines or street lines of streets, or the centerlines or
right-of-way lines, such district boundaries shall be construed as being
parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the official
Zoning Map. If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be determined by the
use of the scale shown on the official Zoning Map.
   (d)   Where the boundary of a district follows a railroad line, such
boundary shall be deemed to be located in the middle of the main tracks of said
railroad line.
   (e)   Where the boundary of a district follows a stream, lake, or other body
of water, said boundary line shall be deemed to be at the limit of the
jurisdiction of the Municipality unless otherwise indicated.
   (f)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they follow or
approximately follow the limits of any municipal corporation, such boundaries
shall be construed as following such limits.
   (g)   Whenever any street, alley, or other public way is vacated by official
Council action, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley,
or public way shall automatically be extended to the center of such vacation,
and all areas within that vacation shall thenceforth be subject to all
regulations appropriate to the respective extended districts.
   All questions and disputes concerning the exact location of zoning district
boundaries shall be resolved by the Planning Commission.

      (Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1129.05  BUFFER AND TRANSITION BETWEEN RESIDENTIAL/COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL/
INDUSTRIAL ZONED PROPERTIES.
   (a)   Under those circumstances where the development of either a single-
family residential project is proposed to occur adjacent to or abutting
property zoned and/or used for industrial or commercial purposes, or in the
case where an industrial or commercial project is proposed to occur adjacent to
or abutting property zoned or used for single-family residential purposes, the
owner or developer of the project must undertake improvements to provide for
the creation of a suitable transition and buffer between the noncompatible
uses. The purpose of the buffer is to obscure noncompatible uses and diminish
the impact that the industrial or commercial activity may have on the
environment found in the single-family residential area. It is intended to
protect the interest of the existing or future occupant of the residential
area. This requirement would only be triggered when new development occurs; it
does not apply to existing conditions.
   (b)   The following provisions shall apply with respect to screening:
      (1)   Screening shall be provided for one or more of the following
purposes:
         A.    A visual barrier to partially or completely obstruct the view of
structures or activities.
         B.   An acoustic screen to aid in absorbing or deflecting noise.
         C.   A physical barrier to contain debris and litter.
      (2)   Screening may consist of one of the following, or a combination of
two or more, as determined by the Municipal Manager or BZA, in the event of an
appeal, variance, or conditional use:
         A.   A solid masonry wall.
         B.   A solidly constructed decorative fence.
         C.   A louvered fence.
         D.   A dense vegetative planting.
         E.   A landscaped mounding.
      (3)   Height of screening shall be in accordance with the following:
         A.   Visual screening walls, fences, plantings, or mounds shall be a
minimum of 6 feet high in order to accomplish the desired screening effect,
except in required front and side yards where the maximum height shall not be
greater than 3-1/2 feet. Fences in front yards are not permitted to be solid
fences. Plantings shall be minimum of 4 feet in height at the time of planting.
         B.   A dense vegetative planting with a minimum height of 4 feet at
planting and a mature height of at least 6 feet or greater, or a solidly
constructed decorative fence, shall be permanently maintained along the mutual
boundary of an accessory parking area and adjacent land zoned for residential
uses, except for the portion of such boundary located within a required front
yard.
      (4)   Screening for purposes of absorbing or deflecting noise shall have
a depth of at least 15 feet of dense planting or a solid masonry wall in
combination with decorative plantings. The height shall be adequate to absorb
noise as determined by Municipal Manager in relation to the nature of the use.
      (5)   Whenever required screening is adjacent to parking areas or
driveways, such screening shall be protected by bumper blocks, posts, or
curbing to avoid damage by vehicles.
      (6)   All screening shall be trimmed, maintained in good condition, and
free of advertising or other signs, except for directional signs and other
signs for the efficient flow of vehicles.
      (7)   The installation of the buffer and transition area must not
interfere with existing storm water drainage flow patterns or utilities which
may be located within easement areas, unless suitable measures are undertaken
to alleviate problems that might be caused by the installation of the buffer.
      (8)   The buffer must commence on the lot line between the subject
properties, unless precluded by insurmountable problems posed by the location
of utilities or easements, on the property which is subject to development. If
insurmountable conditions prohibit the commencement of the buffer and
transition area on the property line, the commencement shall occur in an area
as close as possible to the common lot line. The Municipal Manager may permit
the installation of the obscuring wall on the opposite side of an alley,
street, or right-of-way when mutually agreeable to the affected property
owners.
         (Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1129.06  PRINCIPAL BUILDING PER LOT.
   Only one principal building shall be permitted on each lot in any zoning
district, subject to the provisions established in each district. However, in
all districts permitting enclosed light or heavy industrial uses, it is
permissible to erect more than one principal building devoted to such
industrial use on the same lot. The development of Planned Unit Developments,
as well as approved site plans, shall also be exempt from this provision.

refuse shall be enclosed on three sides by a solid wall, fence, or shrubbery of
at least 4 feet in height, unless within an enclosed building or structure.
Provisions shall be made for regular and adequate vehicular access to such
areas for collection purposes, as determined necessary by the Municipal
Manager. Storage areas of proper density in residential districts shall utilize
such additional screening as required in this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1129.09  FENCES AND ELECTRONIC FENCES.
   (a)   Fences constructed within a rear yard and side yard shall not be
higher than six (6) feet.  All fences are considered an accessory structure.
 
   (b)   No fence, wall, or hedge shall rise over thirty-six (36) inches in
height on any required front yard.  No fence, wall or hedge planting shall
interfere with visibility from a driveway or public right-of-way.  The

fence, “Invisible Fence, or similar containment system, must post visible
signage evidencing that such containment system is in place.
 
   (k)   An electronic fence, “Invisible Fence”, or similar containment system
shall require a building permit, same as construction of any other fence or
barrier requires.
 
   (l)   An electronic fence, “Invisible Fence”, or similar containment system,
must have its boundary no less than four (4) feet from the property line of the
property on which the electronic fence, “Invisible Fence”, or other similar
containment is constructed.
(Ord. 14-53.  Passed 8-18-14.)
   (m)   No one shall construct or install any electronic fence, “Invisible
Fence”, or similar containment system, on any property that abuts or is

Use Permit shall be made to the Municipal Manager, which shall contain a
graphic description of the property to be used, a description of the proposed
use, and a site plan, with sufficient information to determine the yard,

   The following uses are deemed to be temporary uses and shall be subject to
the specified regulations and time limits which follow, as well as the
regulations of any district in which they are located:
   (a)   Real estate sales offices, which shall contain no living
accommodations, shall be permitted within any district for any new subdivision
for a period of 1 year, except that two extensions not to exceed 6 months each

times for any particular lot within any 12-month period, and not more than one
permit may be issued at the same time for any lot. The applicant must submit a
current vendor's license or transient vendor's license, and a written statement

Use Permit shall be prominently displayed at the site.
   (e)   Garage sales, which for the purposes of this section shall include
yard sales, barn sales, and similar activities, may be permitted within any
district in which dwellings are permitted. Any individual or family may conduct

to signs and parking are observed. Garage sale permits shall only be issued to
groups of families, neighborhood organizations, and community organizations two

1129.14  HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   (a)   This section seeks to balance the needs of some individuals to work at
with rights of other individuals to enjoy the residential character of their
neighborhood and their private property.  Further, the purpose of this section
is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the neighborhood residents and
the preservation of the neighborhood as a comfortable place for the people who
live there.
 
   (b)   It is also the intent and purpose of this section to provide for
certain types of restricted occupational uses within residential districts. 
Only such uses will be allowed which:
      (1)   Are incidental to the use of the premises as a residence;
      (2)   Are compatible with residential uses;
      (3)   Are limited in extent; and
      (4)   Do not detract from the residential character of the neighborhood.
 
   (c)   Home occupations are permitted in the A, R-1AAA, R-1AA, R-1A, R-1, R-
2 and R-3 Districts.  “Home occupation” means an occupation conducted in a
dwelling unit, provided that:
      (1)   Only members of the family residing on the premises shall be
engaged in a home occupation, with the exception that the family operating the
home occupation shall be allowed to have no more than one employee engaged in
providing the home occupation services.
      (2)   The use of the dwelling unit or other incidental structures used
for the purpose of engaging in the home occupation shall be clearly incidental
and subordinate to its use for residential purposes by its occupants, and not
more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the floor area of the dwelling unit
shall be used in the conduct of the home occupation.  In the case of the use of
accessory structures, there shall be no limitation on the percentage of the
floor area which may be used therein in the conduct of the home occupation.
      (3)   There shall be no exterior visible evidence of the conduct of a
home occupation.
      (4)   No traffic shall be generated by a home occupation in greater
volume than would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood, and any
need for parking generated by the conduct of such home occupation shall meet
the off-street parking requirements as specified in this Zoning Ordinance and
shall not be located in a required front yard.
      (5)   No equipment or process shall be used in a home occupation which
creates noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors or electrical interference
detectable to the normal senses off the lot.  In the case of electrical
interference, no equipment may be used which causes fluctuations in line
voltage off the premises, nor shall the electrical interference create any
visible or audible interference in radio or television receivers.
      (6)   The residential character of the dwelling exterior shall not be
changed.
      (7)   No offensive noise, vibrations, smoke, or other particulate matter,
odorous matter, heat, humidity, glare or other objectionable affect within
shall be produced therein or therefrom.
      (8)   No merchandise shall be sold or processed except that which is
produced or incidental to the services rendered on the premises.
      (9)   All owners of home occupations shall register for Municipal Income
Tax.
      (10)   All home occupations shall require a Conditional Use Permit.
      (11)   Upon receipt of the application for a Conditional Use Permit as
required in subsection (c)(10) hereof, the Manager shall provide written notice
to all parties who either own or reside in any property which is within 200
feet of the property which is the subject of the Home Occupation/Conditional
Use Permit application.  This written notification shall notify the recipient
that he/she has 14 days from the date of the mailing of the notification in
order to contact the Manager with any objections that he/she may have
concerning the granting of the requested Conditional Use Permit.  If no
objections are received by the Manager, and if the Conditional Use Permit meets
all other requirements, then the Conditional Use Permit shall be granted.  If,
however, the Manager receives objection(s) to the granting of the Conditional
Use Permit then the Manager shall place the matter on the agenda for a public
hearing with the Board of Zoning Appeals, but in no event shall said public
hearing be held after 45 days subsequent to the receipt of the application for
a Conditional Use Permit.  Whether the Conditional Use Permit application is
approved by either the Manager or the Board of Zoning Appeals, either the
Manager or the Board of Zoning Appeals may, at their discretion, impose
restrictions as they deem appropriate.
      (12)   Any violation of Section
1129.14 of the Codified Ordinances of the Municipality of Germantown shall
result in an immediate revocation of the Conditional Use Permit.  In the event
that a Conditional Use Permit previously issued is revoked, such revocation may
be without hearing.  In the event that the Conditional Use Permit is revoked
without hearing, the holder of the Conditional Use Permit shall be entitled to
a hearing and said hearing must be requested by the holder of the Conditional
Use Permit within five (5) days of the revocation of same without hearing.  In
the event that the holder of the Conditional Use Permit requests a hearing on
the revocation of the Conditional Use Permit, said hearing shall be held within
ten (10) days of the date that said request for hearing is made.  Said hearing
shall be held before the Board of Zoning Appeals and the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall, within thirty (30) days after the hearing, either make a finding
in support of the revocation of the Conditional Use Permit, make a finding
against the revocation of the Conditional Use Permit, or place additional
conditions on the use of the property but not revoke the Conditional Use
Permit.

1130.01.1 GENERAL.
   (a)   Title.  These regulations shall be known as the Property Maintenance
Code of the Municipality of Germantown, hereinafter referred to as "this
code". 
 
   (b)   Scope.  The provisions of this code shall apply to all existing
residential and nonresidential structures and all existing premises and shall
constitute minimum  requirements and standards for premises, structures,
equipment and facilities for light, ventilation, space, heating, sanitation,
protection from the elements, life safety, safety from fire and other hazards,
and for safe and sanitary maintenance; the responsibility of owners, operators
and occupants; the occupancy of existing structures and premises, and for
administration, enforcement and penalties. 
 
   (c)   Intent.  This code shall be constructed to secure its expressed
intent, which is to ensure public health, safety and welfare insofar as they
are affected by the continued occupancy and maintenance of structures and
premises.  Existing structures and premises that do not comply with these
provisions, or a previous regulation or code under which the residential or
nonresidential structure and all existing premises was constructed, altered, or
repaired, shall be altered or repaired to provide a minimum level of health and
safety as required herein.  Repairs, alterations, additions to and change of
occupancy in existing buildings shall comply with the Chapter 34 of the Ohio
Building Code.
 
   (d)   Severability.  If a section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of
this code is, for any reason, held to be unconstitutional, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this code.  (Ord. 10-41. 
Passed 12-20-10.)
1130.01.2 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   General.  The provisions of this code shall apply to all matters
affecting or relating to structures and premises, as set forth in Section
1130.01.1.   Where, in a  specific case, different sections of this code
specify different requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.
 
   (b)   Maintenance.  Equipment, systems, devices and safeguards required by
this code or a previous regulation or code under which the structure or
premises was constructed, altered or repaired shall be maintained in good
working order.  No owner, operator or occupant shall cause any service,
facility, equipment or utility which is required under this section to be
removed from or shut off from or discontinued for any occupied dwelling, except
for such temporary interruption as necessary while repairs or alterations are
in progress.  The requirements of this code are not intended to provide the
basis for removal or abrogation of fire protection and safety systems and
devices in existing structures.  Except as otherwise specified herein, the
owner or the owner's designated agent shall be responsible for the maintenance
of buildings, structures, and premises.
 
   (c)   Application of other codes.  Repairs, additions or alterations to a
structure, or changes of occupancy, shall be done in accordance with the
procedures and provisions of the Chapter 34 of the Ohio Building Code.  Nothing
in this code shall be construed to cancel, modify or set aside any provision of
the Germantown Zoning Code.
 
   (d)   Existing remedies.   The provisions in this code shall not be
construed to abolish or impair existing remedies of the jurisdiction or its
officers or agencies relating to the removal or demolition of any structure
which is dangerous, unsafe or unsanitary. 
 
   (e)   Workmanship.   Repairs, maintenance work, alterations or installations
which are caused directly or indirectly by the enforcement of this code shall
be executed and installed in a workmanlike manner and installed in accordance
with the manufacturer's installation instructions and shall be performed and
completed within the period ordered by the code official. 
 
   (f)   Historic building.  The provisions of this code may be waived for
existing buildings or structures designated as a historic building or historic
structure by any federal or state agency or department, or by the Village of
Germantown. 
 
   (g)   Referenced codes and standards.  The codes and standards referenced in
this code shall be those that are listed in Section
1130.08 and considered part of the requirements of this code to the prescribed
extent of each such reference.  Where differences occur between provisions of
this code and the referenced standards, the provisions of this code shall
apply. 
 
   (h)   Requirements not covered by code.  Requirements necessary for the
strength, stability or proper operation of an existing fixture, structure or
equipment, or for the public safety, health and general welfare, not
specifically covered by this code, shall be determined by the code official. 
(Ord. 10-41.  Passed 12-20-10.)

required or permitted in the discharge of official duties.
   Any suit instituted against any officer or employee because of an act
performed by that officer or employee in the lawful discharge of duties and
under the provisions of this code shall be defended by the legal representative
of the jurisdiction until the final termination of the proceedings unless said
legal representative is legally prevented from engaging in such
representation.  The code official or any subordinate shall not be liable for
costs in an action, suit or proceeding that is instituted in pursuance of the
provisions of this code; and any officer of the department of property
maintenance inspection, acting in good faith and without malice, shall be free

(Ord. 10-41.  Passed 12-10-10.)

   (a)   General.  The code official shall enforce the provisions of the code.
 
   (b)   Rule-making authority.  The code official shall have authority as
necessary in the interest of public health, safety and general welfare, to
recommend adoption and procedures; to interpret and implement the provisions of
this code; to secure the intent thereof; and to designate requirements
applicable because of local climatic or other conditions.  Such rules shall not
have the effect of waiving structural or fire performance requirements
specifically provided for in this code, or of violating accepted engineering
methods involving public safety. 
 
   (c)   Inspections.   The code official shall make all of the required
inspections, or shall accept reports of inspection by approved agencies or
individuals.  All reports of such inspections shall be in writing and be

opinion as deemed necessary to report upon unusual technical issues that arise,
subject to the approval of the appointing authority. 
 
   (d)   Right of entry.   The code official is authorized to enter the

unless otherwise provided for by other regulations. 
 
   (h)   Coordination of inspections.  Whenever in the enforcement of this code
or another code or ordinance, the responsibility of more than one code official
of the jurisdiction is involved, it shall be the duty of the code officials
involved to coordinate their inspections and administrative orders as fully as
practicable so that the owners and occupants of the structure shall not be
subjected to visits by numerous inspectors or multiple or conflicting orders. 
Whenever an inspector from any agency or department observes an apparent or
actual violation of some provision of some law, ordinance or code not within
the inspector's authority to enforce, the inspector shall report the findings
to the code official or other official having jurisdiction.  (Ord. 10-41. 
Passed 12-20-10.)
1130.01.5 APPROVAL.
   (a)   Modifications.   Whenever there are practical difficulties involved in
carrying out the provisions of this code, the code official shall have the
authority to grant modifications for individual cases, provided the code
official shall first find that special individual reason makes the strict
letter of this code impractical and    the modification is in compliance with
the intent and purpose of this code and that such modification does not lessen
health, life and fire safety requirements.  The details of action granting
modifications shall be recorded and entered in the official records.
 
   (b)   Alternative materials, methods and equipment.  The provisions of this
code are not intended to prevent the installation of any material or to
prohibit any method of construction not specifically prescribed by this code,
provided that any such alternative has been approved by the code official prior
to installation or construction.  An alternative material or method of
construction shall be approved where the code official finds that the proposed
design is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the provisions of this
code, and that the material or method of construction shall be approved where
the code official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies
with the intent of the provisions of the code, and that the material, method or
work offered is, for the purpose intended, at least the equivalent of that
prescribed in this code in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance,
durability and safety. 
   (c)   Required testing.  Whenever there is insufficient evidence of
compliance with the provisions of this code, or in order to substantiate claims
for alternative materials or methods, the code official shall have the
authority to require tests to be made as evidence of compliance at no expense
to the jurisdiction. 
      (1)   Test methods.   Test methods shall be as specified in this code or
by the other recognized test standards.  In the absence of recognized and
accepted test methods, the code official shall be permitted to approve
appropriate testing procedures performed by an approved agency.
      (2)   Test reports.  Reports of tests shall be retained by the code
official for the period required for retention of public records.

equity to restrain, correct or abate such violation, or to require the removal
or termination of the unlawful occupancy of the structure in violation of the
provisions of this code or of the order or direction made pursuant thereto. 
Any action taken by the authority having jurisdiction on such premises shall be
charged against the real estate upon which the structure is located and shall
be a lien upon such real estate.
   (d)   Abatement of violation.  The imposition of the penalties herein
prescribed shall not preclude the legal officer of the jurisdiction from
instituting appropriate action to restrain, correct or abate a violation, or to

illegal act, conduct, business or utilization of the building, structure or
premises.  (Ord. 10-41.  Passed 12-20-10.)

1130.01.8 UNSAFE STRUCTURES AND EQUIPMENT.
   (a)   General.  When a structure or equipment is found by the code official

found unlawful, such structure shall be condemned pursuant to the provisions of
this code. 
      (1)   Unsafe structures.  An unsafe structure is one that is found to be 
dangerous to the life, health, property or safety of the public or the 
occupants of the structure by not providing minimum safeguards to  protect or
warn occupants in the event of fire, or because such structure contains unsafe
equipment or is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe or of
such faulty construction or  unstable foundation, that partial or complete
collapse is possible. 
      (2)   Unsafe equipment.  Unsafe equipment includes any boiler, heating 
equipment, elevator, moving stairway, electrical wiring or device, flammable
liquid containers or other equipment on the premises or within the structure
which is in such disrepair or condition that equipment is a hazard to life,
health, property or safety of the public or occupants of the premises or
structure. 
      (3)   Structure unfit for human occupancy.   A structure is unfit for
human occupancy whenever the code official finds that such structure is unsafe,
unlawful or, because of the degree to which the structure is in disrepair or
lacks maintenance, is unsanitary, vermin or rat infested, contains filth and
contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary or heating
facilities or other essential equipment required by this code, or because the
location of the structure constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the
structure or the public.
      (4)   Unlawful structure.    An unlawful structure is one found in whole
or in part to be occupied by more persons than permitted under this code, or
was erected, altered or occupied contrary to law.
   (b)   Closing of vacant structures.    If the structure is vacant and unfit
for human habitation and occupancy, and is not in danger of structural
collapse, the code official is authorized to post a placard of condemnation of
the premises and order the structure closed up so as not to be an attractive
nuisance.  Upon failure of the owner to close up the premises within the time
specified in the order, the code official shall cause the premises to be closed
and secured through any available public agency or by contract or arrangement
by private persons and the cost thereof shall be charged against the real
estate upon which the structure is located and shall be a lien upon such real
estate and may be collected by any other legal resource. 
 
   (c)   Notice.   Whenever the code official has condemned a structure or
equipment under the provisions of this section, notice shall be posted in a
conspicuous place in or about the structure affected by such notice and served
on the owner or the person or persons responsible for the structure or
equipment in accordance with Section
1130.01.7 (c).  If the notice pertains to equipment, it shall also be placed on
the condemned equipment.  The notice shall be in the form prescribed in Section
1130.01.7 (b). 
   (d)   Placarding.  Upon failure of the owner or person responsible to comply
with the notice provisions within the time given, the code official shall post
on the premises or on defective equipment a placard bearing the word
"Condemned" and a statement of the penalties provided for occupying the
premises, operating the equipment or removing the placard. 
      (1)   Placard removal.  The code official shall remove the condemnation
placard whenever the defect or defects upon which the condemnation and
placecarding action were based have been eliminated.  Any person who defaces or
removes a condemnation placard without the approval of the code official shall
be subject to the penalties provided by this code.
   (e)   Prohibited occupancy.  Any occupied structure condemned and placarded
by the code official shall be vacated as ordered by the code official.  Any
person who shall occupy a placarded premises or shall operate placarded
equipment, and any owner or any person responsible for the premises who shall
let anyone occupy a placarded premises or operate placarded equipment shall be
liable for the penalties provided by this code.
(Ord. 10-41.  Passed 12-20-10.)
1130.01.9   EMERGENCY MEASURES.
   (a)   Imminent danger.  When, in the opinion of the code official, there is
imminent danger of failure or collapse of a building or structure which
endangers life, or when any structure or part of a structure has fallen and
life is endangered by the occupation of the structure, or when there is actual
or potential danger to the building occupants or those in the proximity of any
structure because of explosives, explosive fumes or vapors or the presence of
toxic fumes, gases or materials, or operation of defective or dangerous
equipment, the code official is hereby authorized and empowered to order and
require the occupants to vacate the premises forthwith.  The code official
shall cause to be posted at each entrance to such structure a notice reading as
follows: "This Structure Is Unsafe and Its Occupancy Has Been Prohibited by the
Code Official."  It shall be unlawful for any person to enter such structure
except for the purpose of securing the structure, making the required repairs,
removing the hazardous condition or of demolishing the same.  The Village of
Germantown shall not be liable in any way for any injury, including death, of
anyone remedying or attempting to remedy any violation of this chapter.  In
addition, the Village of Germantown shall not be liable for any injury,
including death, for any occupant who fails to comply with an order to vacate
the dangerous premises forthwith.
   (b)   Temporary safeguards.  Notwithstanding other provisions of this code,
whenever, in the opinion of the code official, there is imminent danger due to
an unsafe condition, the code official shall order the necessary work to be
done, including the boarding up of openings, to render such structure
temporarily safe whether or not the legal procedure herein described has been
instituted; and shall cause such other action to be taken as the code official
deems necessary to meet such emergency. 
 
   (c)   Closing streets.  When necessary for public safety, the code official
shall temporarily close structures and close, or order the authority having
jurisdiction to close, sidewalks, streets, public ways and places adjacent to
unsafe structures, and prohibit the same from being utilized. 
 
   (d)   Emergency repairs.  For the purposes of this section, the code
official shall employ the necessary labor and materials to perform the required
work as expeditiously as possible. 
 
   (e)   Costs of emergency repairs.  Costs incurred in the performance of
emergency work shall be paid by the jurisdiction.  The legal counsel of the
jurisdiction shall institute appropriate action against the owner of the
premises where the unsafe structure is or was located for the recovery of such
costs. 
      (1)   Recovery of administrative costs.  The Municipality may recover
from the owner of the property such costs as it may incur under this code, plus
its actual cost of staff time and legal services, in the event that civil
litigation is initiated and the Municipality prevails in the action.
      (2)   Recovery of abatement expenses.  The expenses incurred by the
Municipality and chargeable to the property owner under Section
1130.03.9  shall be a lien upon the land.  Whenever an invoice for such
expenses remains unpaid by the property owner for thirty (30) days after actual
receipt, the Administrator shall make a written return to the County Auditor of
the expenses to be charged and a proper description of the premises.  Such
amounts, when allowed, shall be entered upon the tax duplicate, shall be a lien
upon such lands from and after the date of entry, and shall be collected as
other taxes, to be returned to the Municipality
   (f)    Hearings.  Any person ordered to take emergency measures shall comply

without the use of a key, tool or force greater than that which is required for
normal operation of the escape and rescue opening.
(Ord. 10-41.  Passed 12-20-10.)
1130.07.3 FIRE-RESISTANCE RATINGS.

1131.02, General Standards For All Conditional Uses.
      (Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1131.02  GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
   In addition to the specific requirements for all conditionally permitted
uses as specified in this section, and notwithstanding the procedural
requirements for Home Occupation as found in Section
1129.14, the BZA shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each
proposed use in terms of the following standards and shall find adequate
evidence showing that such use at the proposed location:
   (a)   Is in fact a conditional use as established under the provisions of
these Regulations and appears on the schedule of District Regulations adopted
for the zoning district involved.
   (b)   Will be in accordance with the general objectives, or with any
specific objective, of the Municipality’s Comprehensive Plan and/or the Zoning
Code;
   (c)   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the same area;
   (d)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring
uses;
   (e)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, water and sewer, and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such service;
   (f)   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for
public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
   (g)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property, or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke,
fumes, glare or odors;
   (h)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
streets;
   (i)   Will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of a natural,
scenic or historic feature of major importance;
   (j)   Will otherwise be in conformance with all other sections of this
Zoning Code.
      (Ord. 13-62.  Passed 11-4-13.)
1131.03  ACTION BY THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   Within 30 days after either the receipt of application or the date of the
public hearing, the BZA shall take one of the following actions:
   (a)   Approve issuance of the Conditional Use Permit by making an
affirmative finding in writing that the proposed conditional use is to be
located in a district wherein such use may be conditionally permitted, that all
conditions for approval of such use in such district have been met, and that
such use will neither result in significant negative impacts upon nor conflict
with surrounding uses. Such written finding may also prescribe supplemental
conditions and safeguards. Upon making an affirmative finding, the BZA shall
direct the Municipal Manager to issue a Conditional Use Permit for such use
which shall list all conditions and safeguards specified by the BZA for
approval.
   (b)   Make a written finding that the application is deficient in
information or is in need of modification and is being returned to the
applicant. Such finding shall specify the information and/or modifications
which are deemed necessary. Make a written finding that the application is
denied and specify the reason(s) for disapproval.
      (Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1131.04  ADDITIONAL CRITERIA.
   (a)   Additional Conditions. The BZA may impose other conditions for a
conditional use in addition to those prescribed in this Section if, in the
BZA's judgment, additional conditions are necessary for the protection of the
public health and for reasons of safety, and convenience.
 
   (b)   Supplemental Conditions and Safeguards. In granting approval for any
conditional use, the BZA may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in
conformance with this Zoning Code. Any violation of such conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the conditional use is
granted, shall be deemed a punishable violation of this Zoning Code.
 
   (c)   Expiration of Conditional Use Permit. A Conditional Use Permit shall
be deemed to authorize only one particular conditional use, and said permit
shall automatically expire if such conditionally permitted use has not been
instituted or utilized within 1 year of the date on which the permit was
issued, or if for any reason such use shall cease for more than 2 years.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1131.05  PUBLIC HEARING.
   A public hearing shall be held by the BZA in considering an application for
a Conditional Use Permit.
   The BZA shall hold a public hearing within 30 days after it receives an
application for a Conditional Use Permit submitted by an applicant through the
Municipal Manager.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1131.06  NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING IN NEWSPAPER.
   Before conducting a public hearing, notice of such hearing shall be given in
one newspaper of general circulation in the Municipality of Germantown at least
10 days before the date of said hearing. The notice shall set forth the time
and place of the hearing, and shall provide a summary explanation of the
conditional use proposed.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1131.07  NOTICE TO PARTIES OF INTEREST.
   Prior to conducting a public hearing, written notice of such hearing shall
be by first- class mail, at least 10 days before the date of the hearing to all
parties of interest, to include all parties within 200 feet. The failure to
deliver the notification as provided in this Section shall not invalidate any
such amendment. The notice shall contain the same information as required in
Section
1135.06 Notice of Public Hearing in Newspaper.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1131.08  PROCEDURE AND REQUIREMENTS TO DETERMINE THAT A USE IS SUBSTANTIALLY
SIMILAR.
   Where a specific use is proposed that is not listed or provided for in this
Zoning Code, the Municipal Manager will make a determination, if the proposed
use is substantially similar to a specific use that is listed or provided for
in this Zoning Code. If the Municipal Manager finds that a use is substantially
similar to a specific use listed in this Zoning Code, the substantially similar
use is deemed to be a substantially similar permitted use in those districts
where the specific use is a permitted use, and a substantially similar
conditional use in those districts where the specific use is a conditionally
permitted use.
   The following standards shall be considered by the Municipal Manager when
making a determination that a use is substantially similar to a permitted or a
conditional use within a specific district:
   (a)   The compatibility of the proposed use with the general use
classification system as specified in this Zoning Code.
   (b)   The nature, predominant characteristics, and intensity of the proposed
use in relation to those uses specified by this Zoning Code as being permitted,
or in the case of a conditional use, conditionally permitted, in that district.
   (c)   The size, dimensional requirements, parking requirements, traffic
generation potential, and other regulatory considerations normally associated
with uses as specified in this Zoning Code.
   Should a use be determined to be substantially similar to a specific
permitted or conditionally permitted use provided for in this Zoning Code, it
shall then be permitted in the same manner and under the same conditions and
procedures as the use is permitted to which it has been found to be
substantially similar.
   If the Municipal Manager determines that a proposed use is not substantially
similar, such determination can be appealed to the BZA.  If the BZA concurs
with the Municipal Manager determination remedy may be sought by the appellant
through the submission of an application for amendment to the Zoning Code.
However, if the Municipal Manager determines that a proposed use is
substantially similar, such determination can also be appealed to the BZA by
other affected or interested parties.
   The Municipal Manager shall maintain as a public record a listing of all
uses which have been determined to be substantially similar. For each such use
the record shall include the use as listed in the Zoning Code, the use listed
in the Zoning Code about which the determination of substantial similarity was
made, and the dates of any actions thereupon. This record shall also contain
the same information for all uses which have been determined not to be
substantially similar. The Municipal Manager shall consult this record in the
process of issuing future permits.

1133.01  INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this Zoning Code, or by amendments
thereto which may later be adopted, lots, uses of land, structures, and uses of
structures and land in combination exist which were lawful before this Zoning
Code was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or
restricted under the terms of this Zoning Code. The legitimate interest of
those who lawfully established these nonconformities are herein recognized by
providing for their continuance, subject to regulations limiting their
completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension, and substitution.
Furthermore, nothing contained in this Zoning Code shall be construed to
require any change in the layout, plans, construction, size, or use of any lot,
structure, or structure and land in combination, for which a Zoning Permit
became effective prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code, or any
amendment thereto. Nevertheless, while it is the intent of this Zoning Code
that such nonconformities be allowed to continue until removed, they should not
be encouraged to survive. Therefore, no nonconformity may be moved, extended,
altered, expanded, or used as grounds for any other use(s) or structure(s)
prohibited elsewhere in the district without the approval of the BZA, except as
otherwise specifically provided for in this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1133.02  USES UNDER CONDITIONAL USE PROVISIONS, NOT NONCONFORMING USES.
   Any use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under the
terms of this Zoning Code shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such
district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1133.03  INCOMPATIBILITY OF NONCONFORMITIES.
   Nonconformities are declared by this Zoning Code to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the districts in which such uses are located. A nonconforming
use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a
structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after
passage of this Zoning Code by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from of the premises, or by the addition
of other uses of a nature which would be generally prohibited in the district
in which such use is located.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1133.04  AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code and upon which actual building
construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in a permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where demolition or removal of an
existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that
the work shall be carried out diligently.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1133.05  SINGLE NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single
lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning
Code, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Zoning
Code. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage
with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though
such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and
requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot
shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
Variances of requirements listed in this Zoning Code, other than lot area or
lot width, shall be obtained only through action of the BZA as described in
Chapter
1143 Appeals and Variances.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1133.06  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD IN COMBINATION.
   If two or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this Zoning Code, and if all or part of the lots with no buildings
do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this
Zoning Code, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner
which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by
this Zoning Code, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a
lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1133.07  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the time of adoption of this Zoning Code, lawful uses of land
exist which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Zoning
Code, the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful,
provided:
   (a)   No such nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   No such nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
   (c)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
Zoning Code shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
      (Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1133.08  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code that could not be built under the terms of this
Zoning Code by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, setbacks,
yards, its location on the lot, bulk, or other requirements concerning the
structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity. It shall not be considered an increase
to its nonconformity if the addition meets all zoning requirements. (See
Illustration- Exhibit "D" Section
 1123.03.)
   (b)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
      (Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1133.09  NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND LAND IN
COMBINATION.
   If a lawful use involving individual structures, or if a structure and land
in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Zoning Code that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this
Zoning Code, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning
Code in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
   (b)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
   (c)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed.
      (Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1133.10  TERMINATION OF NONCONFORMITIES.
   (a)   Termination of Use Through Discontinuance. When any nonconforming use
is discontinued or abandoned for more than 6 months, any new use shall not
thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in
which it is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
The intent to continue a nonconforming use shall not be evidence of its
continuance.
 
   (b)   Use by Damage or Destruction. Any non-conforming use of a building or
structure which has been damaged or destroyed may be reconstructed as it
previously existed prior to the damage or destruction. Such restoration shall
not cause a new nonconformity, nor shall it increase the degree of
nonconformance or noncompliance existing prior to such damage or destruction. A
Zoning Certificate pertaining to such restoration shall be applied for and
issued within 6 months of such damage or destruction, and rebuilding shall be
completed within 6 months of issuance of Zoning Permit. When such a
nonconforming structure is so damaged or destroyed, and not going to be
reconstructed as it previously existed, no rebuilding, restoration, or
reoccupation shall be permitted except in conformity with all applicable
regulations of this Zoning Code.

legislative action by the Municipal Council, with a recommendation by the
Planning Commission.
   (b)   Step 2 - Pre-Application Meeting.  The applicant shall be required to
meet with Municipal staff prior to the submittal of Preliminary Development
Plan.  No approval or denial of the Preliminary Development Plan will be
administered during this step.
   (c)   Step 3 - Preliminary Development Plan.  A Preliminary Development Plan
must be reviewed and acted on by the Planning Commission.
   (d)   Step 4 - Final Development Plan.  A Final Development Plan must be
reviewed and acted on by Planning Commission.  Action on the Final Development

1135.04  APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   The PUD shall operate as an overlay zone with all the existing zoning
districts remaining intact.  All provisions of the underlying zoning shall
apply, except as provided for in the chapter.
 
   (b)   A minimum project area of ten (10) acres shall be required to
establish a PUD.  The Municipal Manager may waive this requirement in cases
where the establishment of a smaller PUD will meet the requirements and purpose
set forth in this chapter subject to final approval of the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 03-105.  Passed 1-20-04.)
1135.05  ZONING PERMIT.
   No Zoning Permit shall be issued for any new construction within an
established PUD without approval of the PUD Final Development Plan.
(Ord. 03-105.  Passed 1-20-04.)
1135.06  RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   (a)   Permitted Uses.  The permitted uses in a PUD shall be those permitted
in the underlying zoning district.  In addition, the following uses shall be
permitted in residential PUDs:
      (1)   Clustered housing in compliance with the following standards:
         A.   The overall density of the development shall not exceed that
permitted in the underlying zoning.
         B.   Townhouse Regulations.
            1.   When single-family homes are to be clustered into townhouses,
there shall be no more than eight (8) units per structure.
            2.   No more than two of the townhouses shall share the same, or
approximately the same, front building line.
            3.   Each townhouse shall have its own yard containing no less than
400 square feet of greenspace or vegetation.  Such yard shall be reasonably
secluded from streets or from neighboring properties and shall not be used for
off-street parking, garages, storage facilities, driveways, or accessory
buildings.
            4.   The minimum distance between any two rows of townhouses shall
be sixty (60) feet.

            1.   The lot area requirement for single-family detached dwelling
lots may be decreased with a minimum lot area of 8,000 square feet for each
dwelling.
            2.   The PUD should not be used to cluster all the homes onto one
part of the development, in a typical subdivision layout, for the preservation
of the remaining portion of the project area.  Instead, small groupings of
clustered lots should be located throughout the project area so that every lot
has direct access or nearby access to greenspace.
         D.   Lots or dwelling clusters shall be done in such a way as to
protect natural or sensitive areas to the maximum extent feasible.
         E.   Sensitive areas shall be identified on both the Preliminary and
Final Development Plan and shall be treated as common open space that may not
be developed in the future.
      (2)   Traditional Neighborhood Residential development in areas adjacent
to downtown Germantown or the older neighborhoods surrounding downtown provided
that the development is in compliance with the following standards:
         A.   Only single-family homes shall be permitted.
         B.   The minimum lot size shall be 7,500 square feet, and shall not
include the right-of-way of a street or alley.

residential PUD is twenty (20) acres or more in size.
         B.   One area of a residential PUD may be designated as a neighborhood
shopping area provided that it does not exceed two (2) acres.
         C.   An additional acre of neighborhood shopping area may be
designated for each fifteen (15) acres of residential PUD project area in
addition to the original twenty (20) acres.
         D.   The total square footage of commercial building space shall not
exceed five percent (5%) of the gross floor areas of all dwellings within the
development.

uses, no commercial use shall be constructed until at least sixty percent (60%)
of the residential units are complete or under construction or unless
authorized by the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Project Area.  It is the intent of this chapter that the use of the
PUD will yield the same net density of dwelling units as would develop under
conventional zoning.  Therefore, the project area that will be used to
determine the permitted number of units shall include all of the area within
the PUD that is devoted to residential use, open space, and recreational uses
designed to serve the residential development specifically excluding but not
limited to land located within a floodway and land allocated for public right-
of-ways.
   (c)   Density Calculation.  The Planning Commission shall determine the net
number of dwelling units that may be constructed within the PUD by dividing the
project area by either of the following:
      (1)   The required lot area per dwelling unit is required in the district
on which the PUD is located; or
      (2)   The required lot area per dwelling unit that is required in the
district on which the PUD is located, as modified by any increases in density
authorized under subsection (e) below.
   (d)   Planned Unit Development In Multiple Zoning Districts.  If a
residential PUD covers more than one (1) zoning district, the number of
allowable dwelling units must be separately calculated for each portion of the
PUD district located in a separate zoning district, and then must be combined
to determine the number of dwelling units allowable in the entire PUD. 
However, the distribution of the dwelling units within the overall PUD is not
to be affected by existing zoning district boundaries.
   (e)   Density Bonus.
      (1)   The Planning Commission may authorize a density bonus in the PUD
under the following circumstances provided that the negative impacts listed in
paragraph (2) below would not be created by such an increase in density:
         A.   For undeveloped common open space above the minimum amount
required in Section
1135.06(h), a maximum increase of five percent (5%) of the net density.
         B.   For improved common open space above the minimum amount required
in Section
1135.06(h), a maximum increase of five percent (5%) of the net density.
         C.   For the preservation of land along corridors that the Planning
Commission recommends the preservation of for future nonresidential
development, a maximum increase of ten percent (10%) of the net density.
         D.   For distinctiveness and excellence in the site, design, and
landscaping of the PUD, a maximum increase of ten percent (10%) of the net
density.
      (2)   In no case shall the density in the planned development be
increased by more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the net density.
      (3)   If the Planning Commission finds that any of the following
conditions would be created by the density bonus provided for above, it may
then deny or limit any density bonus by an amount that is sufficient to avoid
the creation of any of these conditions.
         A.   Congested or unsafe access to the developments;
         B.   Traffic congestion in the streets which adjoin the PUD
development; or
         C.   An excessive burden on parks, infrastructure, recreational areas,
schools and other facilities, beyond what would be created by typical
development densities that serve or are proposed to serve the PUD development.
   (f)   General Review Guidelines.  In evaluating a proposed PUD, the
following guidelines shall be used by the Planning Commission:
      (1)   The residential PUD is consistent with all goals, objectives,
policies, and plans as adopted by the Municipal Council.
      (2)   The PUD is an effective and unified treatment of the development
possibilities on the project site, and the development plan makes appropriate
provisions for the preservation of streams and stream banks, wooded cover,
rough terrain, and similar areas.

proposed development in the area surrounding the project site.
      (4)   Off-street parking and loading is provided as required by the
Germantown Zoning Code.
      (5)   There is a beneficial relationship between the proposed PUD and the
neighborhood where it is to be established.
      (6)   Evidence of sufficient or proposed off-site and on-site services
and infrastructure is presented.  If the services or infrastructure are not in
place, assurances that the improvements will be placed at the completion of
construction of the project shall be required.  Adequate information shall be
supplied on the capacity and demand of current and proposed roadway, sanitary
sewer, stormwater facilities, and the water system.

by the Planning Commission provided that the overall density standards required
in this chapter are maintained and that the Planning Commission determines that
the proposed development complies with the intent of this chapter.
      (3)   The Planning Commission may not permit a reduction in any lot so as
to create a lot area that will be smaller than 50% of the lot area as required
by the underlying zoning.
   (h)   Open Space Requirements.  Common open space shall be provided as
follows:

1136.01  PURPOSE.
   The Rural Residential Overlay District is composed of certain quite, low-
density, residential appeal with a rural character, plus certain open areas
where similar residential development appears likely to occur.  The regulations
for this district are designed to stabilize and protect the essential
characteristics of the district, to promote and encourage a suitable
environment for family life, to provide for an orderly transition from
predominately agricultural uses to mostly rural residential uses, and to
strictly limit activities of a commercial nature.  To these ends, development
is limited to relatively low densities and permitted uses are limited basically
to single-family dwellings for the residents, home-occupation uses for
compatible home-based businesses, as well as certain additional institutional
uses such as schools, parks and churches that serve the residents of the
district.
(Ord. 04-44.  Passed 7-19-04.)
1136.02  QUALIFYING LANDS.
   Lands qualifying for the inclusion in the Rural Residential District shall
be within the areas mapped as Agricultural.  The minimum area required to
create a district shall be five (5) acres of contiguous total land.
(Ord. 04-44.  Passed 7-19-04.)

the site design in order to encourage:
   •   Natural resource preservation
   •   Pedestrian-friendly streetscapes
   •   Cost-efficiency in providing infrastructure
   •   Appropriate design solution for unique site conditions.
   Use of the Compact Development Option is voluntary on the part of the
applicant.
   The Compact Development Option permits smaller lot sizes in return for
providing permanent green space within the development, and a more compact,
cost-effective network of streets and utilities.  Except for modification to
the lot and building requirements defined below, all other provisions of the
Rural Residential District pertain to the Compact Development Option.
   (a)   Lot Requirements for Compact Option.
      (1)   Minimum lot size: One half (½) acre, provided that no less than

1139.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT. 
   Signs constitute a separate and distinct use of the premises upon which they
are placed. Signs affect the use of private as well as public property,
including adjacent roads, streets, walkways and other rights-of-way. The
purpose of this Chapter is to establish reasonable and objective regulations
for all signs visible to the public, in order to protect the general public
health, safety, welfare, convenience and aesthetics. The intent of this Chapter
is to ensure freedom of expression for all sign uses while maintaining a
content-neutral approach to sign regulation.  Specifically, to:
   (a)     Protect the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity,
and general welfare;
     (b)     Protect each person's constitutional right to freedom of speech;
   (c)     Show respect for citizens' need for self-expression;
     (d)     Permit signs containing a noncommercial message, constituting a
form of expression in lieu of other sign copy or content;
     (e)     Protect historic and culturally significant signs;
     (f)     Promote the use of signs that are aesthetically pleasing, of
appropriate scale, and integrated with surrounding buildings and landscape, in
order to meet the City's expressed desire for quality development; and,
     (g)    Protect the public from a traffic safety concern by addressing
driver fatigue, impairment, judgment, error, risk taking, and traffic
violations that could occur from the:
                (1)     Distraction of electronic and changeable copy signs
                (2)     Distraction from signs that move or rotate or give the
illusion of moving or rotating, and
                (3)     Use of letters, numbers, characters, symbols, logos and
colors that hinder motorist and pedestrian perception and reaction time.

(Ord. 17-46.  Passed 2-5-18.)
1139.17  PROHIBITED SIGN MATERIALS.
   No exterior portion or display area of any permanent exterior sign open to

   (a)   Converted, laminated, manufactured or processed materials, such as and
including, but not limited to, paper, unfinished, unsealed, or untreated non-
exterior grade plywood, pressboard, wafer-board, cardboard, polystyrene foam or
similar material not generally recognized and expressly designed for sign

   (b)   Fabric and canvas, unless used in conjunction with awning or canopy
signs. 
      (Ord. 17-46.  Passed 2-5-18.)
1139.18  PERMITTED SIGN MATERIALS.
   (a)   All exterior portions and display areas of any permanent exterior sign
open to the elements shall be constructed of one (1) or more of the following
materials:
              (1)   Aluminum, brick, glass plastic, painted treated or
stainless steel, stone, rough-faced block, thermoplastic, hard vinyl; finished,
sealed or treated exterior grade wood, or similar compatible materials in any
combination generally recognized and expressly designed for sign construction,
erection and operation.
      (2)   Fabric and canvas shall be permitted when used in conjunction with

   (a)   Sign letters, numbers, characters, symbols and logos shall demonstrate
consistency and uniformity in color, spacing and style.
   (b)   Sign colors shall provide sufficient contrast between lettering,
numbers, characters, symbols, logos and their background.
   (c)   Colors or color combinations that interfere with legibility of the

         (Ord. 17-46.  Passed 2-5-18.)
1139.20  SIGN ILLUMINATION.
   (a)   Illuminated signs should only be used if necessary.
   (b)   Any sign illumination shall be shielded or arranged as to confine the
illumination to the sign, avoid glare or other disturbance on adjacent property
and rights-of-way.
   (c)   A direct light source for illuminated signs is preferred. This is
usually the best arrangement because the sign will appear to be better
integrated with the building's architecture.
      (1)    Light fixtures supported in front of the structure can cast
desirable light on the sign and generally a portion of the face of the
structure as well. direct lighting emphasizes the continuity of the structure's
surface, and signs become an integral part of the façade.
      (2)    Direct lighting is also appropriate because it produces a more
intimate ambiance on the street. the lighting of signs should be considered as
an element in a building's overall lighting design.
      (3)   The light source shall be shielded. Whenever direct lighting
fixtures are used, care should be taken to properly shield the light source to
prevent glare from spilling over into residential areas and any public right-
of-way.
   (d)   Signs should be lighted only to the minimum level required for
nighttime readability.
   (e)   If back-lighted signs are used, solid letters are encouraged. signs
consisting of opaque individually cut letters mounted directly on a structure
(push-through letters) can often use a distinctive element of the structure's
façade as a backdrop, thereby providing a better integration of the sign with
the structure.
   (f)   Any illuminated sign, or any illuminated element of any sign, may turn
on or off, or change its brightness, provided that:
      (1)     Change of illumination does not produce any apparent motion of
the visual image, including but not limited to illusion of moving objects,
moving patterns or bands of light, expanding or contracting shapes, rotation or
any similar effect of animation.
      (2)     Change of illumination does not occur in less than five (5)
second intervals.
      (3)   Any sign that incorporates a change of illumination shall not be
permitted within 1,000 feet of another sign that incorporates a change of
illumination on the same side of a roadway visible in the same direction of
travel.
      (4)   Such sign shall contain a default design that will freeze the
illumination in one position or prevent further illumination if a malfunction
occurs.
      (5)   Any sign that incorporates a change of illumination shall not be
permitted on any wall or fence.
   (g)   No sign or any part of any sign may move or rotate or give the
illusion of moving or rotating.
   (h)    Any sign visible from a public street shall not display any
illuminated light or a color authorized by law to be used in traffic control
signals, or so near to any such light or color as to tend, in the opinion of
the Chief Of Police, City Manager, or designee, to interfere with, mislead or
confuse operators of motor vehicles or pedestrians on any public street.
(Ord. 17-46.  Passed 2-5-18.)
1139.21  LANDSCAPING REQUIRED.
   All detached signs shall require a single continuous landscaped area to be
maintained around the entire base of the sign in accordance with the following
standards:
   (a)   All signs shall have one (1) square foot of landscaping at the base of
the sign for each two (2) square feet of sign surface area on single-faced and
multiple-faced signs.
   (b)   For signs with multiple faces, the landscaped area shall be allocated
so that a portion of the required landscaping is located in front of each sign
face.
   (c)   Where the required landscaped area is adjacent to a paved surface
accessible to vehicular traffic, a raised non-mountable curb suitable to
prevent vehicular encroachment into the landscaped area shall be required. The
minimum distance between the face of any such required curb and any part of the
sign shall be thirty (30) inches.
   (d)   The required landscaped area shall contain materials such as, but not
limited to, vegetative ground covers, perennials, shrubs, and ornamental trees
covering at least fifty percent (50%) of the defined landscaped area at
maturity. Artificial plant materials shall not be included in fulfilling this
requirement.
   (e)   Unless modified by the City Manager or designee, all landscaping plans
shall be prepared by a qualified landscape designer, nurseryman,
horticulturalist or certified landscape architect.
   (f)   The landscaping plan shall be submitted and approved in conjunction
with the sign permit application, as regulated by this Zoning Code. A plan of
the landscaped area with the name, quantity, and spacing of plant materials
shall be included as part of the sign permit application.
   (g)   Season permitting, all landscaping and related plantings shall be
installed within sixty (60) days from the date of issuance of the sign permit,
but in no case shall said installation be completed later than April 30th of
the next calendar year.
   (h)   The property owner shall be responsible for landscape installation and
maintenance:
      (1)   Replacement of plant materials that do not survive after
installation in required landscaped areas is required within the next planting
season or within six (6) months of the plant's demise.
      (2)   Required landscaped areas, curbed area and other delineating
improvements shall receive regular repair and maintenance.

   (a)   Except for political and real estate signs, which shall be exempt from
this Section, the following regulations shall apply to all temporary signs in
any non-residential zoning district. 
      (1)    A sign shall not exceed twelve (12) feet in area per face.
      (2)    A sign shall not exceed six (6) feet in height.
      (3)    There shall be no more than one (1) sign permitted per lot.
   (b)   Except for political and real estate signs, which shall be exempt from
this Section, the following regulations shall apply to all temporary signs in
any residential zoning district.
      (1)   Permitted sign size and height.
         A.   Single-family and two-family residential uses.
            1.    The sign area shall not exceed six (6) square feet per face.
            2.    Sign height shall not exceed six (6) feet.
            3.     There shall be no more than one (1) sign permitted per lot.
            4.   The illumination of a temporary sign shall be prohibited.
         B.   Religious uses, institutional uses, educational uses, multi-
family residential uses and unimproved property.
            1.     A sign shall not exceed twelve (12) feet in area per face
            2.     A sign shall not exceed six (6) feet in height.
            3.    There shall be no more than one (1) sign permitted per lot. 
 
            4.   The illumination of a temporary sign shall be prohibited.
   (c)    Except for political and real estate signs, which shall be exempt
from this Section, temporary signs shall be permitted for a maximum of fifteen
(15) consecutive days, and not more than sixty (60) days during each calendar
year.
(Ord. 17-46.  Passed 2-5-18.)
1139.23 TEMPORARY REAL ESTATE SIGNS.
   In addition to any other temporary sign permitted on a premises by this
Chapter, one (1) additional temporary real estate sign per lot frontage shall
be permitted which conveys information which pertains only to the for sale, for
lease, or for rent status of the premises on which the sign is located.  (Ord.
17-46.  Passed 2-5-18.)
1139.24  SIGN MEASUREMENTS.
   (a)   Area Computation of Individual Signs. The area of a sign comprised of
individual letters or words is determined by calculating the area of the
smallest geometric figure (e.g. square, rectangle, circle, polygon, etc.) that
can be drawn around the letters and/or elements. Signs consisting of individual
letters and/or elements will be measured as one sign when the distance between
the letters and/or elements is less than the largest dimension of the largest
sign letter.
   (b)    Area Computation of Multi-faced Signs. Where the sign faces of a
double-faced sign are parallel, only one display face shall be measured in
computing sign area. If the two faces of a double-faced sign are of unequal
area, the area of the sign shall be the area of the larger face. In all other
cases, the areas of all faces of a multi-faced sign shall be added together to
compute the area of the sign. Sign area of multi-faced signs is calculated
based on the principle that all sign elements that can be seen at one time or
from one vantage point should be considered in measuring that side of the sign.
   (c)     Sign Height Computation. The height of a sign shall be computed as
the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the
highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be
the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling,
berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In
cases where the normal grade is below grade at street level, sign heights shall
be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the
base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of
a public or private street.
   (d)     Building Frontage. Building frontage shall mean the horizontal
length of a building on the side with its principal entrance. If that side is a
straight wall, then the building frontage shall be the length of the wall. If
the side is not a straight wall, the building frontage shall be the horizontal
distance from the corner at one end of the side of the building with the
principal entrance to the other corner on the same side of the building; where
that side of the building is concave, then the measurement shall be made in a
straight line from corner to project in front of the front corners, then the
measurement shall be made as the shortest distance between two lines projected
from the two front corners of the building, with such lines parallel to each
other and as close as practicable to perpendicular to the front of the
building.

the Germantown or Miami Valley community.

located, except that in any residential district, premises signs shall not be

modified or replaced by a sign which conforms to the applicable requirements of
this Chapter and other applicable requirements of the Germantown Codified
Ordinances.   
(Ord. 17-46.  Passed 2-5-18.)
1139.28  NONCONFORMING SIGNS AND STRUCTURES.
   Signs and sign structures legally in existence prior to the effective date
of this Zoning Code which violate or are otherwise not in conformance with the

1123.02
 
 
1143.01  INTENT.
   Appeals and variances shall conform to the procedures and requirements of
this Zoning Code. The BZA has appellate jurisdiction relative to appeals and
variances.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1143.02  ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS.
   (a)   Appeals to the BZA concerning interpretation or administration of this
Zoning Code may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer or bureau of
the legislative authority of the Municipality affected by any decision of the
Municipal Manager. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the decision
by filing, with the Municipal Manager and with the BZA, a Notice of Appeal
specifying the grounds upon which the appeal is being taken. The Municipal
Manager shall transmit to the BZA all the papers constituting the record upon
which the action appealed from was taken.
 
   (b)   A record capable of transcription and containing all documents
presented as evidence or utilized by the BZA shall be made of any hearing held
under this section.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1143.03  VARIANCES.
   The BZA may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the
terms of this Zoning Code as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this
Zoning Code would result in unnecessary hardship for use variance and practical
difficulties for area variances. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district and no permitted or nonconforming
use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered
grounds for issuance of a variance. Variances shall not be granted on the
grounds of convenience or profit, but only where strict application of the
provisions of this Zoning Code would result in unnecessary hardship.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1143.04  APPLICATION AND STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES.
   Except as otherwise permitted in this Zoning Code, no variance in the strict
application of the provisions of this Zoning Code shall be granted by the BZA
unless the BZA shall find that the written application for the requested
variance contains all of the following requirements:
   (a)   Name, address, and phone number of applicant(s).
   (b)   Legal description of property.
   (c)   Description or nature of variance requested.
   (d)   A fee as established by Zoning Code. (See Section
1145.08 Schedule of Fees.)
   (e)   A list of all property owners and their mailing addresses who are
within 200 feet of the parcel requesting variance.
   (f)   Narrative statements establishing and substantiating that the variance
conforms to the following standards:
      (1)   The granting of the variance shall be in accord with the general
purpose and intent of the regulations imposed by this Zoning Code on the
district in which it is located, and shall not be injurious to the area or
otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
      (2)   The granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of
any use which is not otherwise permitted in the district.
      (3)   There must exist special circumstances or conditions, fully
described in the findings, applicable to the land or buildings for which the
variance is sought, which are peculiar to such land or buildings and do not
apply generally to land or buildings in the area, and which are such that the
strict application of the provisions of this Zoning Code would deprive the
applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building. Mere loss in value
shall not justify a variance; there must be deprivation of beneficial use of
land.
      (4)   There must be proof of hardship or practical difficulty created by
the strict application of this Zoning Code. It is not sufficient proof of
hardship to show that greater profit would result if the variance were granted.
Furthermore, the hardship complained of cannot be self-created; nor can it be
established on this basis by one who purchases with or without knowledge of the
restrictions; it must result from the application of this Zoning Code; it must
be suffered directly by the property in question; and evidence of variances
granted under similar circumstances need not be considered.
      (5)   The granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of
the land or building, and the variance as granted is the minimum variance that
will accomplish this purpose.
      (6)   The granting of the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
         (Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1143.05  ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   The BZA may further prescribe any conditions and safeguards that it deems
necessary to ensure that the objectives of the regulations or provisions to
which the variance applies will be met. Any violation of such conditions and
safeguards, when they have been made a part of the terms under which the
variance has been granted, shall be deemed a punishable violation under this
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1143.06  PUBLIC HEARING BY THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   The BZA shall hold a public hearing within 45 days after the receipt of an
application for an appeal or variance from the Municipal Manager.
(Ord. 05-81.  Passed 12-19-05.)
1143.07  NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING IN NEWSPAPER.
   Before conducting the public hearing required, notice of such hearing shall
be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the Municipality
at least 10 days before the date of said hearing. The notice shall set forth
the time and place of the public hearing, and the nature of the proposed appeal
or variance.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1143.08  NOTICE TO PARTIES OF INTEREST.
   Before conducting the public hearing required, written notice of such
hearing shall be mailed, by first-class mail, at least 10 days before the day
of the hearing to all parties within 200 feet. The failure to deliver the
notification as provided in this Section shall not invalidate any such
amendment. The notice shall contain the same information as required in Section
1143.07 Notice of Public Hearing in Newspaper.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1143.09  ACTION BY BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   Within 30 days after the public hearing, the BZA shall either approve,
approve with supplemental conditions as specified in Section
1143.05 Additional Conditions and Safeguards, or disapprove the request for
appeal or variance. The BZA shall further make a finding in writing that the
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance that
will make possible a reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
(Ord. 00-30. Passed 6-5-2000.)
1143.10  TERM OF VARIANCE.
   No order of the BZA granting a variance shall be valid for a period longer
than 12 months from the date of such order unless the Zoning Permit or zoning
approval is obtained within such period, and the erection or alteration of a
building is started or the use is commenced within such period.

   (a)   HOOKAH.  A type of water pipe used to smoke tobacco or other legal
non-tobacco substances, in which air is heated by charcoal or burning embers
and passed through the tobacco or other substance to form smoke, and the smoke
then passes through a water-filled chamber where it is filtered and cooled, and
then inhaled through a tube and mouthpiece by one or more users during a
smoking session which may last from forty five (45) to sixty (60) minutes or
longer.  At the end of a smoking session, the dirty water is discarded and the
water chamber is refilled for the next user(s).  The term "hookah" may also be
referred to as a water pipe, narghile, argileh, goza, or hubble bubble.

as its primary use or as an ancillary use, is devoted to the on-premises use of

is not limited to establishments referred to as smoking, cigar, or tobacco bars

bars.

1149.02  HOOKAH BARS. 
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to differentiate hookah
bars from smoking establishments, retail tobacco stores, and general retail
sales due to their inherent differences in nature, function, and effect; and to

minimize adverse effects on surrounding property and ensure the goals of the
Zoning Ordinance of the City of Germantown to maintain and enhance the

discretion of the City Manager are necessary to ensure compatibility with other
uses in the vicinity and to ensure the public health, safety, and welfare.

for any of the following reasons:  the applicant has been convicted of a
felony; the applicant is under the age of twenty-one (21) years; the applicant

neighborhoods, improve site layouts, and protect natural features and
environmental values;
   (f)   To provide for a greater variety of uses and building types at a
higher density than would normally be allowed, and allowing greater flexibility
in site planning so as to promote affordable housing and the preservation of
open space and historic resources within the development; and
   (g)   To provide for the review of all such proposals prior to construction,
to ensure compliance with the above intent and objectives and to assure that
the proposal will not result in or contribute to incompatible use of the land,
pollution of the soil or groundwater, traffic congestion or inappropriate site
development.

High (DBH), water courses, one hundred year flood plains, wetlands, ponds and
other water bodies, marshes, stone walls, scenic points, and historic sites are
encouraged to be preserved in the following manner:
      (1)   Stone walls should be preserved by locating property boundaries
along the existing line of the walls.
      (2)   Trees greater than 12" DBH in size should be preserved, if
reasonably possible, by retaining natural grades and locating houses to
minimize tree removal.
      (3)   Wetlands and water bodies should be incorporated into nature trails
and other passive recreational uses.
   (e)   Suitable and usable outdoor recreational area or areas shall be
provided for use of tenants.  At least 1,000 square feet per dwelling unit must
be usable open space for active and passive recreation (this amount may be
included in the twenty percent (20%) common open space requirement set forth
above).  Usable open space may be defined to include land for community
gardens, hiking/jogging paths, tennis courts, swimming pools or similar

   (g)   Provision shall be made so that the common open space shall be owned
in common and readily accessible to the owners and residents of all units in
the development or by membership corporation, trust or association whose
members are the owners and residents of the units.  In all cases the common
open space shall be subject to a perpetual restriction running to or
enforceable by the Municipality which shall be recorded in respect to such
land.  Such restriction shall be in such form and substance as the Municipal
Council shall prescribe, and may contain such additional restrictions on
development as the Municipal Council may deem appropriate.  (Ord. 08-42.

with the application, and are subject to the approval of the Municipal Council.
   (b)   Such agreements/covenants shall provide that in the event that the
association fails to maintain the common facilities in reasonable order and
condition in accordance with the agreement/covenant, the Municipality may,
after notice to the association and public hearing, enter upon such land and
maintain it in order to preserve the taxable value of the properties within the
development and/or prevent the common land from becoming a public nuisance. 
The agreements/covenants shall also provide that the cost of such maintenance
by the Municipality shall be assessed ratably against the properties within the
development.  (Ord. 08-42.  Passed 8-18-08.)

1170.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of Germantown, State of Ohio, does ordain as
follows:
 
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Municipality of Germantown has special flood
hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the  jurisdiction of the
Municipality of Germantown as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including 
any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the Municipality of
Germantown.
 
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, Flood
Insurance Rate Map dated January 6, 2005.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard
include:
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authorized by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Germantown as required by Section
1170.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Municipality of Germantown, 75 N. Walnut St.,
Germantown, OH 45327.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Municipality of Germantown, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
 
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.  (Ord. 04-
65.  Passed 10-18-04.)
1170.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory Structure” means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal” means a  request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base Flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.  The base flood may also be referred to
as the 1% chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from 1 to 3 feet).

storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor.” See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).”  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill” means a  deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood or Flooding” means a  general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)”.  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones”.  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:
   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:
   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood
depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths
are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:
   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of
1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:
   Special hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
   Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage areas less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
   Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation.” The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus 1 foot of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway.”  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized
by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure”. Any structure that is:
      (1)    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing  maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).” A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
LOMC's are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest Floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purpose of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park”.  As specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which
three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home
park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)”.  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as financial protection against
flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction” means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the
Municipality of Germantown Flood Insurance Rate Map, July 2, 1981, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   “Person” includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle” means a  vehicle which is (1) built on a
single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently
towable by a light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a
permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping,
travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered Professional Architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   “Registered Professional Engineer” means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   “Registered Professional Surveyor” means a  person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   “Special Flood Hazard Area”.  Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of  excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.

condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial Improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered new
construction,
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure.
   (kk)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to

management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
are base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.    Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed
structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special
flood hazard area;
            3.    Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.    Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring
the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section

Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1170.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data.   The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Municipal Manager
of Municipality of Germantown, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Municipality of Germantown have been modified by annexation or the community
has assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and
enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that
the Municipality of Germantown Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent
the Municipality of Germantown boundaries, include within such notification a
copy of a map of the Municipality of Germantown suitable for reproduction,
clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the
Municipality of Germantown has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation
and  floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA.  Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1170.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including tornado, wind, heavy snow, flood, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard  areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located  in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged 
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to 
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair
process.  These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims. (Ord. 04-65.  Passed 10-18-04.)

         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.    Section
1170.04(i)(1)B.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any  change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage”.  The field determination of “bankfull stage" shall be based
on methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards  apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such 
notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement  with
the Municipality of Germantown specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If
an agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1170.03(j)(1)A.3., when an alteration of a watercourse results in  the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.

showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
the Municipal Clerk's Office, 75 N. Walnut Street, Germantown, Ohio 45327.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1170.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals.  Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within fifteen (15) days of the date of such notice and
order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by
the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of
the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties
in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is
submitted.
 
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of 
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Montgomery Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

1195.02  INTENT AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The intent of this chapter is to protect the land and water resources
of the Municipality of Germantown by establishing standards to achieve a level
of soil erosion and stormwater control that will minimize and abate degradation
of land and water resources and damage to public and private property resulting
from earth disturbing activities.  In addition this regulation further intends
to:
      (1)   Assure that those involved in earth-disturbing activities minimize
both soil erosion and the volume and rate of stormwater runoff from their
sites.
      (2)   Preserve to the extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the site and minimize the need to construct, repair, and
replace enclosed, subsurface storm drain systems.
      (3)   Assure that stormwater controls are incorporated into site planning
and design at the earliest possible stage and that all stormwater management
practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.
      (4)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil and to
promptly re-vegetate and stabilize the site following earth disturbing
activities.
      (5)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and stormwater management
practices.
      (6)   Encourage the construction of stormwater management practices that
serve multiple purposes such as flood control, erosion control, fire
protection, water quality protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (7)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
groundwater recharge.

      (4)   Any earth disturbing activity within critical and sensitive natural
areas,  including floodplains, highly erodible lands (HEL) and wetlands.
   (d)   This chapter does not apply to earth disturbing activities associated
with agricultural activities.
 
   (e)   No earth disturbing activity subject to regulation under this chapter
shall be undertaken for any land proposed for development or redevelopment for
uses specified under subsection (c) hereof without an approved Site Development
Plan as required under Section
1195.04, and, if appropriate, a Stormwater Management Plan (SMP) as required
under Section 1195.09.
 
   (f)   Final approval of a proposed development or redevelopment shall not be
given unless:
      (1)   A determination is made by the Municipal Manager’s Office based on
submission of a site Development Plan as detailed in Section
1195.04 that the proposed earth disturbing activity will not cause accelerated
runoff, erosion, and/or sediment impacts harmful to the quality of off- site
lands and waters, or
      (2)   A SMP as detailed in Section
1195.05 has been approved by the Municipal Manager or his designee based on the
recommendation of the Municipal Manager’s Office that determines that the
proposed earth disturbing activity will not cause accelerated runoff, erosion,
and/or sediment impacts harmful to the quality of off-site lands and waters.
   (g)   Any person or persons seeking approval for an earth disturbing
activity listed below shall prepare a SMP as described in Section
1195.05.
      (1)   Activities disturbing greater than or equal to one (1) acre, or
less than one (1) acre, if part of a larger common plan of development or sale.
      (2)   Activities that require the extension of public utilities

(Ord. 08-80.  Passed 12-1-08.)
1195.03  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   All Erosion and Sediment Kept on Site.
      (1)   Erosion and sedimentation caused by accelerated wind or stormwater
runoff over the site due to earth disturbing activities shall be stabilized and
confined to within the boundaries of the development site.
   (b)   Discharge of Untreated Stormwater.
      (1)   To the maximum extent practicable the site shall not discharge
untreated stormwater directly into a receiving body of water.
   (c)   Structural and Nonstructural Best Management Practices.
      (1)   Nonstructural stormwater management practices shall be used to the
maximum extent practicable.  Such practices may include, but not be limited to,
preserving riparian areas, preserving existing vegetation and vegetative buffer
strips, phasing of construction, and designation of tree  preservation areas.
      (2)   Nonstructural and structural stormwater management practices shall
be designated in accordance with requirements and standards specified in this
chapter and/or by the Municipal Manager’s Office.
      (3)   Structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices shall
be placed in easements and recorded on the property deeds on which they are
located and shall remain unaltered unless first approved by the Municipal
Manager’ Office.
      (4)   In designing stormwater detention and retention facilities, water
quality benefits shall be considered to the maximum extent practicable, per EPA
Permit OH C000002 or later updates.
   (d)   Stream and Wetland Riparian Buffers.
      (1)   The site owner and/or applicant shall leave an undisturbed riparian
buffer on both sides of and/or surrounding water resources, except for
crossings and other riparian area and wetland impacts approved by the Village
Manager’s Office and other applicable agencies.  Buffer width will be
determined on a case by case basis using criteria such as floodplain,
topography, vegetative cover, canopy cover, and soil types, etc.
   (e)   Channel Protection.
      (1)   To protect stream channels from degradation specific channel
protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the latest edition of
Rainwater and Land Development.
   (f)   Temporary Stabilization of Disturbed Areas and Soil Stockpiles.
      (1)   A temporary vegetative cover shall be established on disturbed
areas as specified in Table 1 below.
               Table 1:  Temporary Stabilization
 
Area requiring temporary stabilization  Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any disturbed areas within 50 feet of a Within 2 days of the recent disturbance
stream and not at final grade.          if that area will remain idle for more
                                        than 21 days.
For all construction activities, any
disturbed area, including soil          Within 7 day s of the most recent
stockpiles, that will be dormant for    disturbance within the area.
more than 21 days but less than one

Disturbed areas that will be idle over  Prior to onset of winter weather.
winter.
      (2)   Application practices include vegetative establishment, mulching,
and the early application of gravel base on areas to be paved.  Soil
stabilization measures should be appropriate for the time of year, site
conditions and estimated time of use.
      (3)   Topsoil removed shall be stored on site and shall be stabilized
with quick growing plants or other means, so that it is protected from wind and
water erosion.  Topsoil shall be maintained in a usable condition for
sustaining vegetation and reused on the site.
   (g)   Permanent Stabilization.
      (1)   A permanent vegetative cover shall be established on disturbed
areas as specified in Table 2 below.
               Table 2:  Permanent Stabilization
 
Area requiring temporary stabilization Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any area that will lie dormant for 6   Within 7 days of the most recent
months or more                         disturbance.
Any area at final grade.               Within 7 days of reaching final grade
                                       within that area.
      (2)   Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until a
ground cover is achieved which is mature enough to control soil erosion and
will survive severe weather conditions.  In the interim the owner/developer is
responsible to maintain appropriate erosion control measures.
   (h)   Cut and Fill Slopes.
      (1)   Cut and fill slopes shall be designed, constructed and stabilized
in a manner which will minimize erosion.  Consideration should be given to the
length and steepness of the slope, the soil type, upslope drainage area, ground
water conditions and other applicable factors.  If after final grading
excessive erosion takes place, additional slope stabilizing measures by the
owner, developer or builder will be required until the problem is corrected. 
The following guidelines are provided to aid in developing an adequate design.
         A.   Roughened soil surfaces are generally preferred to smooth
surfaces on slopes.
         B.   Diversions should be constructed at the top of long steep slopes
which have significant drainage areas above the slope.  Diversions or terraces
may also be used to reduce slope length.
         C.   Concentrated stormwater should not be allowed to flow down cut or
fill slopes unless contained within an adequate channel, flume or slope drain
structure.
         D.   Wherever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane which
endangers the stability of the slope, adequate drainage or other protection
should be provided.
   (i)   Protection of Adjacent Properties/Public Rights of Way.
      (1)   Properties, public rights of way, and thoroughfares adjacent to the
site of an earth disturbing activity shall be protected from sediment
deposition.  This may be accomplished by preserving a well-vegetated buffer at
the perimeter of the site, by installing perimeter controls such as sediment
barriers, filters, dikes, sediment basins, or by a combination of such
measures.
   (j)   Sediment Control Structures.
      (1)   Sediment control structures shall be used to control erosion and
trap sediment on a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days.  Such
structures may include, but are not limited to, silt fences, storm drain inlet
protection, sediment basins and diversions or channels which direct runoff to a
sediment basin.  All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding
runoff in order to be considered functional.
      (2)   Sediment control structures shall be constructed as a first step in
grading and be made functional before upslope earth disturbing activities take
place.  Earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and diversions shall be seeded
and mulched as soon as the installation is complete.  Sediment control
structures shall be functional throughout the course of earth disturbing
activity and until the site is stabilized with permanent vegetation.  The
owner/developer is responsible to maintain erosion control measures until the
Municipal Manager’s Office determines stabilization is complete.
      (3)   Sheet slow runoff from the site shall be intercepted by silt fence
or diversions.  Silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and shall be
capable of temporarily ponding runoff.  The relationship between the maximum
drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown  in Table 3
below.
            Table 3:  Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
 
Maximum drainage area (in acres) Range of slope for a particular
to 100 linear feet of silt fence drainage area (percent)
0.5                              <2%
0.25                             >2% but < 20%
0.125                            >20% but <50%
      (4)   Storm water diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away

individual subdrainage unit for a 24-hour storm of a one- year frequency.
            4.   Include a hydrograph for a 24-hour storm of the critical
frequency to be controlled and all calculations made pertinent to evaluating
the effects of the proposed development on the pre-development runoff
conditions of the site.
         B.   Calculations for the design of stormwater management facilities
shall demonstrate the following for each subdrainage unit:
            1.   The peak rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all more
frequent storms occurring on the site does not exceed the peak rate of runoff
from a one (1) year frequency, twenty-four (24) hour storm occurring on the
same site under pre-development conditions.
            2.   Storms of less frequent occurrence than the Critical Storm, up
to the 100 year storm shall have their peak runoff rates no greater than the
peak runoff rates from equivalent storms   under pre-development conditions.

construction will be considered meeting this standard.
         C.   Calculation of a critical storm for each subdrainage unit of the
site shall be determined as follows:
            1.   Calculate by appropriate hydrologic methods, such as the NRCS
Technical Release 552 , total volume of runoff from a one-year frequency, 24-
hour storm occurring on the development area before, during, and after
development.
            2.   From the volumes determined in subsection (h)(1)C.1. above,
determine the percentage increase in volume of runoff due to the proposed
development, and using this percentage, select the 24-hour critical storm from
this table:
 
% Equal to or % Less The Critical Storm for Peak Rate Control

1301.01  ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective January 1, 2016, as amended to
date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units.  Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance.  Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use.  Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization.  To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose.  When the Building
Official finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the
provisions of this Code, it shall be approved.  Materials, equipment and
devices approved by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio
Building Code shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such
approval.
      (OBC 101.3)

1301.07  UNSAFE BUILDINGS.
   (a)   Unsafe Buildings Defined.   Structures or existing equipment that are
unsafe or unsanitary due to inadequate means of egress facilities, inadequate
light and ventilation, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise
dangerous to human life, shall be deemed a serious hazard.  Where a building is
found to be a serious hazard, such hazard shall be eliminated or the building
shall be vacated, and where such building, when vacated, remains a serious
hazard, it shall be razed.
   (b)   Orders, Injunction Proceedings.  Where the Building Official finds
that a building is a serious hazard and the owner of such building fails, in
the time specified in an order from the Building Official, to eliminate such
hazard, or to vacate or raze the building, the building official shall proceed
under Ohio R.C. 3781.15.
   (c)   Restoration.  Where the structure or equipment is determined to be
unsafe by the Building Official, it is permitted to be restored to a safe
condition.  To the extent that repairs, alterations or additions are intended

structure, such repairs, alterations, additions or change of occupancy shall
comply with Chapters 1 and 34 of the Ohio Building Code and this chapter.
(OBC 109)
1301.08  CONFLICT.
   (a)   General. Where, in any specific case, different sections of the Ohio
Building Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other
requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.  Where there is a conflict
between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific
requirement shall be applicable.
   (b)   Other Laws.  The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall not be
deemed to nullify any provisions of state or federal law.  The Municipality may
make further and additional regulations, not in conflict with Ohio R.C.
Chapters 3781 and 3791 or with the rules of the Board of Building Standards. 
However approval by the Board of Building Standards of any fixture, device,
material, system, assembly or product of a manufacturing process, or method or
manner of construction or installation shall constitute approval for their use
anywhere in Ohio.
   (c)   Other Rules.  As  provided in division (B) of Ohio R.C. 3781.11, the
rules of the Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order,
standard or rule of the Divisions of State Fire Marshal or Industrial
Compliance in the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Health and of
counties and townships, in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are
in conflict with the rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that
rules adopted and orders issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3743 prevail in the event of a conflict.
   There may be other requirements owners may be required to meet as set forth
by other licensing agencies such as the Ohio State Fire Marshal, Ohio
Department of Health, the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services, Ohio
Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, Ohio Department of
Developmental Disabilities, federal agencies, or other licensing authorities. 
Owners and designers should investigate these additional licensing agency
requirements to ensure they are incorporated into the building design before
submitting to the certified building department for plan approval.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3781.10 shall govern any rule or standard adopted by the Board pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 4104.02 and 4105.011.  (OBC 102)
1301.09  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Building Official.  The Building Official is responsible for the
enforcement of the rules of the Board and of Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791
relating to the construction, arrangement, and the erection of buildings or
parts thereof.  All building officials shall conduct themselves in a
professional, courteous, impartial, responsive, and cooperative manner.  The
Building Official shall render interpretations of this Code and to adopt
policies and procedures in order to clarify the application of its provisions. 
Such interpretations, policies and procedures shall be in compliance with the
intent and purpose of this Code.  Building Officials shall be responsible to
assure that a system is in place to track and audit all projects, to assure
that all Building Department personnel perform their duties in accordance with
this section, and for the overall administration of a Building Department as
follows:
   (b)   Applications and Plan Approvals.  The Building Official shall receive
applications, require or cause the submitted construction documents to be
examined, ascertain by such examinations whether the construction indicated and
described is in accordance with the requirements of this Ohio Building Code,
and shall issue plan approvals for the construction, erection, alteration,
demolition and moving of buildings and structures.  The Building Official shall
require a master plans examiner or elective plans examiners to examine the
construction documents to verify the construction indicated is in accordance
with the requirements of this Code and shall assure coordination of plan
review.
   (c)   Plan Examination by the Building Official.  When the Building
Department does not have in its full-time employ a certified master plans
examiner, the certified Building Official shall examine construction documents
to determine compliance with the rules of the Board if the registered design
professional elects to submit construction documents that contain a written
certification by the registered design professional indicating conformance with
the requirements of the rules of the Board and Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and
3791.
   (d)   Orders.  The Building Official shall issue all orders in accordance
with Section 1301.06 to ensure compliance with the Ohio Building Code.
   (e)   Inspections.
      (1)   If the plans for the erection, construction, repair, alteration,
relocating, or equipment of a building are subject to inspection by the
Building Official, under Section 108 of the Ohio Building Code, the Building
Official shall cause to be made such inspections, investigations, and
determinations as are necessary to determine whether or not the work which has
been performed and the installations which have been made are in conformity
with the approved construction documents.  The Building Official shall identify
any special conditions that would affect the timing of inspections and schedule
inspections times mutually agreed upon by the Building Official and the owner. 
      (2)   Special inspections are as required under Section 1704 of the Ohio
Building Code.
   (f)   Department Records.  The Building Official shall keep official records
of applications received, certificate of plan approvals issued, notices and
orders issued, certificates of occupancy, certificates of completion and other
such records required by the rules of the Board of Building Standards.  Such
information shall be retained in the official permanent record for each
project.  One set of approved construction documents shall be retained by the
Building Official for a period of not less than one hundred eighty days from
date of completion of the permitted work, or as required by document retention
regulations.
   (g)   Department Reports.  The Building Official shall be responsible for
the submission of reports and any requested special information to the Board of
Building Standards as required in paragraph (F) of Rule 4101: 7-2-01 of the
