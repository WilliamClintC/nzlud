B) When the provisions of this zoning resolution are inconsistent with one another or with the provisions found in another adopted resolution, the more restrictive provision shall govern.
C) Where this zoning resolution imposes a greater restriction than imposed or required by other provisions of law or by other rules, regulations or resolutions, the provisions of this zoning resolution shall control provided it complies with the ORC and federal law.
1.06: Relationship with Private-Party Agreements
A) This zoning resolution is not intended to interfere with or abrogate any easements, covenants, or agreements between parties, provided that wherever this zoning resolution proposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or land, upon the location or height of buildings or structures, or upon requirements for open areas than those that are imposed or required by such easements, covenants, or agreements between parties, the provision of this zoning resolution shall govern.
B) In no case shall the Township be obligated to enforce the provisions of any easements, covenants, or agreements between private parties.

B) Such zoning permit shall state that such structure, building, land, or a part thereof, and the proposed use thereof, are in conformity with the provisions of this zoning resolution.
1.09: Severability

2) Area/Dimensional Variance
The following factors shall be considered and weighed by the BZA to determine practical difficulty:
(a) Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district; examples of such special conditions or circumstances are: exceptional irregularity, narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to nonconforming and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
(b) Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
(c) Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary to make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
Article 3: Development Review Procedures
3.08: Variances
20
(d) Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
(e) Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of governmental services including, but not limited to water, sewer, police and fire protection, trash pickup;
(f) Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of actions of the owner;
(g) Whether the property owner's predicament can feasibly be obviated through some method other than a variance;
(h) Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance; and
(i) Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
No single factor listed above may control, and not all factors may be applicable in each case. Each case shall be determined on its own facts.
3) Use Variance
In order to grant a use variance, the BZA shall determine that strict compliance with the terms of this resolution will result in unnecessary hardship to the applicant. The applicant must demonstrate such hardship by clear and convincing evidence that all of
the following criteria are satisfied:
(a) The property cannot be put to any economically viable use under any of the permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property is located;
(b) The variance requested stems from a condition which is unique to the property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district;
(c) The variance requested cannot otherwise be resolved by a zoning map amendment;
(d) The hardship condition is not created by actions of the applicant;
(e) The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;
(f) The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety or general welfare;
(g) The variance will be consistent with the general spirit and intent of this Resolution;
and
(h) The variance sought is the minimum that will afford relief to the applicant.
4) The BZA shall not be authorized to grant a variance for a use that is otherwise prohibited in the zoning district in which the property is located.
5) The BZA may authorize a variance when such variance will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the resolution will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the resolution shall be observed and substantial justice done.
Article 3: Development Review Procedures
3.08: Variances
21
6) The BZA may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the property benefited by a variance as the BZA may deem necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this section, to reduce or minimize the impact of such variance upon other property in the neighborhood and to further the purpose and intent of this zoning resolution.
7) No granting of a variance shall be authorized unless the BZA finds that such variance
from the provisions or requirements of this zoning resolution will not be contrary to the public interest, and owing to special conditions pertaining to a specific piece of property, the literal enforcement of the provisions or requirements of this zoning resolution
would cause unnecessary hardship. The BZA may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed structure or use, as it may deem necessary in the interest of the furtherance of the purposes of the zoning resolution and in the public interest.
8) No variance shall be considered or granted by the BZA, which would allow a change in use of a parcel, building or structure where such change of use could be accomplished by a redistricting of the subject property.

Article 5: Nonresidential Zoning Districts
5.01: General Purpose and Intent
The districts contained in this section are created to:
A) Realize the general purpose set forth in Section 1.01 (Purpose) of this zoning resolution;
B) Provide appropriately located areas within Pierce Township for a full range and scale of business, office, and industrial uses in accordance with Township policy;
C) Promote a safe and compatible environment for businesses;
D) Strengthen the Township’s economic base, and provide employment opportunities close to home for residents of the Township and surrounding communities;
E) Encourage a business-friendly climate which will foster growth in the commercial sector, while protecting the character of the neighborhoods;

G) Maintain and enhance the attractiveness and vitality of the Township’s neighborhood business areas.
5.02: Specific Purpose Statements
A) Neighborhood Business District (NB)
The Neighborhood Business District (NB) is intended primarily for small-scale commercial and office uses that dispense convenience goods and services directly to consumers on the premises. This district is designed for the local hamlets and crossroad centers of Pierce Township that have historically been zoned commercial but are not of a size or in a location designed for the larger scale businesses envisioned for the GB District.
B) General Business District (GB)
The General Business District (GB) is intended to provide for a wide range of retail sales and services that would relate to the varied needs of the Township, the business community, and the visitor. The general uses in this district rely heavily on vehicular traffic and thus are located appropriately on arterial roadways and highways.
C) Industrial District (I)
The Industrial District (I) is intended to provide for areas of land where the principal uses are industrial uses that require special buffering and setback regulations to mitigate adverse impacts including noise, odors, and related impacts.
D) Resort and Recreational District (RR)
The Resort and Recreational District (RR) is designed for areas of the Township that are primarily used for resort or recreational uses that are more commercial in nature than those uses that might be compatible with residential neighborhoods.
5.03: Permitted Uses
A) Table 5.04-1 below sets forth the uses allowed within the nonresidential zoning districts. The abbreviations used in the table are described in Section 4.04.
B) Drive –Through Access
Drive-through access to any of the goods and/or services offered within the principal building is considered part of the principal permitted use. Compliance with the stacking requirements set forth at Section 11.05 is required.

55
Article 7: Planned Unit Development (PUD)
7.01: Establishment of Planned Unit Development Types
The following types of PUDs are hereby established and may be proposed through a Zoning Map Amendment:
A) "PUD-R" – Planned Residential Use - A planned unit development where the primary use of land is residential with the ability to include public, institutional, and recreational uses as approved by the Township.
B) "PUD-MU" – Planned Mixed-Use – A planned unit development that includes a mixture of residential, commercial, and office uses as specified in this article with the ability to also include public, institutional, and recreational uses as approved by the Township.
C) "PUD-B" – Planned Business Use – A planned unit development where the primary use of land is commercial, office, and/or industrial with the ability to include public, institutional, and recreational uses as approved by the Township.
7.02: Purpose Statements
A) Overall Purpose
This article is intended to permit the creation of Planned Unit Development Districts (PUDs) to encourage the efficient use of land and resources, promote greater efficiency in providing public and utility services, and encourage innovation in the planning and building of all types of development. Such districts may be permitted as amendments to the Pierce Township Zoning Map, on application and approval of specific and detailed plans where tracts suitable in location and character for the uses and structures proposed are to be planned and developed. Regulations set forth in this article are adopted to accommodate unified planning and development that are consistent with existing established land use patterns in Pierce Township. The Township's character is related to the physical attributes of the Township, including its land use patterns and natural resources. The PUD district is intended to achieve the following land use objectives:
1) Provide a variety of housing and lot sizes to promote the planning of a development that is more sensitive to the protection of natural resources on sites by clustering the housing in areas physically suited to accommodating development and preserving the resources in open space.
2) Minimize the number of residential lots that are less than the stated lot area minimums for the underlying residential zoning district.
3) Encourage the protection of open space by permitting developments with a range of densities that also provide both active and passive open space, consistent with the open space character of the surrounding area.
4) Preserve open spaces to reduce erosion, improve water quality, provide wildlife habitats, retain scenic views, and reduce storm water runoff
5) Preserve areas with steep terrain by respecting topography and other natural features in the development plan and maintaining significant percentages of land in open space in wooded and sloped areas.
Article 7: Planned Unit Development (PUD)
7.03: PUD Procedure
56
6) Provide for a variety of housing types in a single unified development that is integrated into the community.
7) Provide a transition between higher densities in the area around the Village of Amelia as a transition between the Village and existing neighborhoods in the Township.
8) Respect the character of surrounding developments by providing appropriate buffers as a transition to higher density uses.
9) Provide a higher level of design review to ensure attractive, well-planned communities and eliminate the barriers to creative and sensitive design that may exist when attempting to comply with conventional district standards and subdivision rules.
10) Respect the balance between building mass or volume and vegetation mass or volume by considering scale relationships between the new development and existing buildings and the landscape.
11) Provide for flexibility in design by allowing for relief from certain zoning regulations to create a development that provides for higher levels of community amenities.
B) Individual District Purpose Statements
The PUD districts shall have the following purposes:
1) Planned Residential Uses (PUD-R)
For residential uses within a PUD, the objective is to encourage the creation of neighborhoods with a variety of housing types that retain natural resources, provide adequate landscaping and open space areas, and are compatible with the character of adjoining land uses. PUD waivers granting reduced residential lot area or dwelling square footage minimums should be applied only when the applicant can demonstrate that the overall development is of a higher quality beyond what is required in a non-PUD zoned development.
2) Planned Mix-Use (PUD-MU) and Business Uses (PUD-B)
For mixed-use developments and business uses within a PUD, the objective is to create streetscapes that emphasize landscaping, coordinated sign control, and uniform architectural character. Proposed buildings should have rooflines and architectural features that provide a sense of identity and emphasize the most important use with visual elements.
C) PUD Waivers
1) In order to allow for flexibility, encourage innovation in land planning and to provide for an overall higher quality development, an applicant may request waivers be granted as a part of this PUD review process. A PUD waiver may provide relief from the strict application of the standards and regulations found within this zoning resolution.
(a) The Board of Trustees may approve, approve with modifications or deny each requested waiver.
(b) The Zoning Commission will provide recommendations on all waiver requests as a part of their Stage II Preliminary Development Plan review and recommendation to the Board of Trustees.

Article 8: Conservation Subdivisions
8.01: Purpose
Conservation subdivisions provide for creative development techniques and tools that preserve natural resources and open spaces while still providing for the development of housing within the Township. Conservation subdivisions are encouraged within Pierce Township as a method to conserve and protect the natural environment and rural character of the Township.
8.02: Property Requirements
A) Conservation subdivisions are permitted where the subject parcel(s) are not separated by a road or other right-of-way prior to development.
B) The applicant must own in fee simple or have an option to purchase all lands within the conservation subdivision. The exception to this is if the applicant is the authorized agent to the property owner, in which case, the applicant need not own the lands.
C) Any lawful ownership arrangement including, but not limited to fee simple lots, is permitted in a conservation subdivision.
D) The arrangement of dwelling units shall comply with all development standards contained in the applicable zoning district as modified in this section.
8.03: Permitted Density
The maximum number of housing units permitted in a conservation subdivision is determined using the minimum lot area required in the applicable zoning district and the formula in Table 8.03-1.
TABLE 8.03-1: PERMITTED DENSITY FORMULA
(TSA/MLA) x 90%
Where
TSA = Total Site Area, in acres, excluding any areas within public rights-of-way existing prior to development, land that is subject to an existing conservation easement, or land located in a floodway. Also, the Total Site Area does not include any area occupied by existing lakes or ponds that are greater than one acre in size.
MLA = Minimum lot area, in acres, required in a given zoning district.
90% is the reduction factor used to account for public or private rights-of-way in a development. When the above formula produces a fractional value, the number shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
8.04: Allowable Uses and Access
A) Allowable uses are those permitted in the applicable zoning district.

9.03: Architectural Design Standards for Nonresidential Buildings
A) Purpose
The purpose of this section is to encourage development that contributes to Pierce Township’s aesthetic values, reflecting the community's physical character, and adding to it in appropriate ways. The architectural design of nonresidential development determines much of the character and attractiveness along the major thoroughfares through the Township. These standards require: a basic level of architectural variety; compatible scale and mass to surrounding development; and mitigation of negative impacts.
B) Architectural Standards
The following design standards shall apply to all development in nonresidential zoning districts.
1) Ornamentation
All visible elevations shall include decorative features such as cornices, pilasters and friezes. Building recesses and protrusions are strongly encouraged on larger buildings to break long uninterrupted building walls. See Figure 9-1.
Article 9: General Development Standards
9.03: Architectural Design Standards for Nonresidential Buildings
89
Figure 9-1: The buildings in the above images contain pilasters, cornices, and a series of façade setbacks (recesses) to visually break up the appearance of large facades.
2) Façade Massing
(a) Front façades 60 feet wide or wider shall incorporate wall offsets of at least two feet in depth (projections or recesses) a minimum of every 40 feet. Each required offset shall have a minimum width of 20 feet. See Figure 9-2.
Figure 9-2: Illustration of how the façade offset provisions may be applied. See also images in Figure 9-1.
(b) The following alternatives can be used in place of the required front façade offsets:
(i) Façade color changes following the same dimensional standards as the offset requirements;
(ii) Pilasters having a minimum depth of one foot, a minimum width of one foot, and a minimum height of 80 percent of the façade’s height (See Figure 9-1.); and/or
Article 9: General Development Standards
9.03: Architectural Design Standards for Nonresidential Buildings
90
(iii) Roofline changes when coupled with correspondingly aligned façade material changes.
(c) Roof Line Changes
(i) Roofline changes shall include changes in roof planes or changes in the top of a parapet wall, such as extending the top of pilasters above the top of the parapet wall.
(ii) When roofline changes are included on a façade that incorporates wall offsets or material or color changes, roof line changes shall be vertically aligned with the corresponding wall offset or material or color changes. See Figure 9-3.
Figure 9-3: Illustration of roofline changes that are aligned with façade offset and changes.
3) Roofs
(a) Flat Roofs
When flat roofs are used, parapet walls with three-dimensional cornice treatments shall conceal them. The cornice shall include a perpendicular projection a minimum of eight inches from the parapet façade plane. See Figure 9-4.
Figure 9-4 : The image on the left illustrates the use of parapet walls to screen mechanical equipment. Tall, thin parapets, such as the one shown in the image on the right, should be avoided to prevent the appearance of false walls.
Article 9: General Development Standards
9.03: Architectural Design Standards for Nonresidential Buildings
91
(b) Roof Penetrations and Equipment
All roof-based mechanical equipment, as well as vents, pipes, antennas, satellite dishes, and other roof penetrations (with the exception of chimneys), shall be located on the rear elevations or screened with a parapet wall having a three- dimensional cornice treatment so as to have a minimal visual impact as seen from:
(i) A public street;
(ii) Existing single family uses;
(iii) Vacant land classified as SFR, TFR, MFR, TR or P and
(iv) Planned residential development districts.
4) Customer Entrances
(a) Required Entrances
For buildings that are 40,000 square feet or larger in gross floor area, each side of the building facing a public street shall include at least one customer entrance, except that no building shall be required to provide entrances on more than two sides of the structure which face public streets.
(b) Entrance Design
Buildings shall have clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances that include no less than three of the following design features (See Figure 9-5):
(i) Canopies/porticos above the entrance; (ii) Roof overhangs above the entrance; (iii) Entry recesses/projections;
(iv) Arcades that are physically integrated with the entrance;
(v) Raised corniced parapets above the entrance;
(vi) Gabled roof forms or arches above the entrance;
(vii) Outdoor plaza adjacent to the entrance having seating and a minimum depth of 20 feet;
(viii) Display windows that are directly adjacent to the entrance;
(ix) Architectural details, such as tile work and moldings, that are integrated into the building structure and design and are above and/or directly adjacent to the entrance; or
(x) Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas or seating areas. A wing wall is a wall secondary in scale projecting from a primary wall and not having a roof.
Article 9: General Development Standards
9.03: Architectural Design Standards for Nonresidential Buildings
92
Figure 9-5: Examples of emphasized customer entrances on larger-scale commercial buildings.
C) Enforcement of Standards
1) The Zoning Inspector shall be responsible for reviewing and enforcing the provisions of this section during the review of a zoning permit application.
2) The Zoning Inspector may choose to send the application to the Zoning Commission at their next regularly scheduled meeting for review and an administrative determination of compliance with these architectural standards.
D) Approval of Alternate Standards
1) An applicant may submit a variance application to propose an alternative to the above architectural standards. In doing so, the following standards must be met:
(a) Proposed alternatives to these architectural standards must be sealed by a registered architect, as the architect of record for the project.
(b) Proposals must, at a minimum, include site plans, building elevations, and perspective drawings or photo overlays. These shall illustrate the improvement(s) in relation to the neighboring facilities including, but not limited to: building shapes and sizes, colors, shade and shadow, signage, entrance treatment, edge treatments and appurtenances. Construction material type and quality shall be noted.
Exterior artificial lighting shall be noted for location, lamp type, size, and fixture type. Treatment of mechanical equipment and service operations shall be also be illustrated.
(c) Visual appeal shall be considered from all pedestrian and vehicular accessible viewpoints surrounding the site.
(d) Additional presentation tools such as material samples, models or electronic visualizations are encouraged but not mandatory.
2) In making its determination, the BZA must find that:
(a) The proposed alternative achieves the intent of the subject design standard to the same or better degree than the subject standard.
(b) The proposed alternative achieves the goals and purpose of this resolution to the same or better degree than the subject standard.
(c) The proposed alternative results in benefits to the community that are equivalent to or better than compliance with the subject design standard.

G) Alternative Parking
The following are two methods of accommodating parking as an alternative to constructing an adequate number of parking spaces on an individual lot.
1) Shared Parking
A portion of the required parking spaces may be located on an adjacent property if the parking area complies with the following standards.
(a) Shared parking is encouraged and permitted if the multiple uses that the shared parking will benefit can cooperatively establish and operate the facilities.
(b) The applicant shall have the burden of proof for reduction of the total number of parking spaces and shall document and submit information substantiating their request. Shared parking may be approved if:
(i) A sufficient number of spaces is provided to meet the highest demand of the participating uses;
(ii) The uses are located adjacent to each other;
(iii) Evidence has been submitted by the parties operating the shared parking facility, to the satisfaction of the Zoning Inspector, documenting the nature of uses and the times when the individual uses will operate so as to demonstrate the lack of potential conflict between them.
(iv) The shared parking spaces will not be located in excess of 200 feet from the uses they are intended to serve;
Article 11: Vehicle Parking, Stacking, and Loading
11.04: Design of Parking Spaces and Aisles
112
(v) A legal shared parking agreement is submitted and approved by the Pierce Township Law Director that provides for the rights of the respective parties to use the shared parking areas in a manner adequate to accommodate multiple users or that parking spaces will be shared at specific times of the day (i.e., one activity uses the spaces during daytime hours and another activity use the spaces during evening hours). This agreement shall include provisions, evidence of deed restrictions or other recorded covenants that ensure that the spaces will be properly maintained during the life of the development. A note that such agreement exists shall be placed on the final site plan submitted to receive a zoning permit.
(vi) The approved shared parking agreement shall be filed with the application for a zoning permit and shall be filed with the County Recorder and recorded in a manner as to encumber all properties involved in the shared parking agreement.
(vii) No zoning permit will be issued until proof of recordation of the agreement is provided to the Zoning Inspector.
(viii) Shared parking shall not account for more than 50 percent of the optimal required parking spaces as established in Section 11.03 (Required Parking Spaces).
2) Off-Site Parking
A portion of the required parking spaces may be located on a separate lot from the lot on which the principal use is located if the off-site parking complies with the following standards.
(a) Off-site parking shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking standards for residential uses, hospitals, bars (if not incidental to a restaurant), or convenience stores and other convenience-oriented uses. Required parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities shall not be located in an off-site parking facility.
(b) No off-site parking space shall be located more than 500 feet from the primary entrance of the use served, measured along the shortest legal, practical walking route. This route may include crossing a right-of-way, provided that it uses a legal crosswalk.
(c) Off-site parking shall not be permitted on a vacant lot in a residential zoning district.
(d) Off-site parking areas shall adhere to the regulations of the same or a more intensive zoning classification than that required for the use served.
(e) In the event that an off-site parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a written off-site parking agreement shall be required.
(f) An off-site parking agreement shall be submitted and approved as to form by the Pierce Township Law Director. This agreement shall include provisions, evidence of deed restrictions or other recorded covenants that ensure that the spaces will be properly maintained during the life of the development.
(g) The off-site parking agreement approved by the Pierce Township Law Director shall be filed with the application for a zoning permit and shall be recorded as a deed restriction or covenant in a manner as to encumber all properties involved in the off-site parking agreement. A note that such agreement exists shall be placed on the final site plan submitted to receive a zoning permit.
Article 11: Vehicle Parking, Stacking, and Loading
11.04: Design of Parking Spaces and Aisles
113
(h) Final inspection to authorize occupancy shall not be granted until proof of recordation of the agreement is provided to the Zoning Inspector.
(i) Off-site parking shall be used and maintained solely for parking as long as the use, as recorded and approved, exists. The off-site parking agreement may be terminated when the additional site is no longer necessary, there is a change of use, or the approved conditions are no longer applicable.

12.01: Purpose
The regulations set forth in this resolution pertaining to signs are intended to:
A) Encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication for businesses, organizations, and individuals in Pierce Township;
B) Maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the Township’s ability to attract sources of economic development and growth;
C) Provide a means of way-finding in the community, thus reducing traffic confusion and congestion;

F) Protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public by minimizing the hazards to pedestrian and vehicular traffic;
G) Differentiate among those signs that, because of their location, may distract drivers on public streets and those that may provide information to them while they remain in their cars but out of active traffic;
H) Minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property; and
I) Prohibit most signs with commercial messages in residence zoning districts, while allowing those commercial messages that relate to commercial activities lawfully conducted on individual properties within such districts.
12.02: Applicability
A) The regulations contained within this article shall apply to all signs and to all zoning districts.
B) Unless otherwise provided by this article, all signs shall require a zoning permit and a payment of fees. No zoning permit is required for the maintenance of a sign or for a change of copy on painted, printed, or changeable copy signs.
12.03: Compliance Required

12.04: Computations
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height.
Article 12: Sign Regulations
12.04: Computations
119
A) The area of a sign face, which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face, shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that shall encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color that is an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from backdrop or structure against which it is placed. This does not include any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning resolution regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
B) The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign.
C) The sign area for a sign with more than one face (multi-faced signs) shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. See Figure 12-1.
D) When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any one point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 24 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
E) When calculating street frontage, only the street frontage that lies in the unincorporated area of Pierce Township shall be used in the calculation.
Figure 12-1: Illustration of calculating sign area.
12.05: General Sign Standards
This article shall apply to any sign that is visible from the public right-of-way or from property other than the property on which the sign is located; signs located entirely within buildings or other structures and/or otherwise not visible from the public right-of-way or from property other than the property on which the sign is located are exempt from this article.
A) No sign shall be erected or maintained at any location where by reason of its position,
working, illumination, shape, symbol, color, form or character it may obstruct, impair, obscure, interfere with the view of, or may be confused with any authorized traffic sign, signal or device, or interfere with, mislead, confuse, or disrupt traffic safety or flow.
B) No portion of a sign shall obscure visibility between a height of three and 10 feet within a sight triangle consisting of the area bounded by the right-of-ways of the adjacent intersecting streets extending along those right-of-ways centerlines 30 feet from the point of right-of-way intersection, and a straight line connecting said latter points. See Figure 12-2.
Article 12: Sign Regulations

I) The light from any illuminated sign or from any light source shall be so shaded, shielded, or directed that the light intensity or brightness shall not adversely affect surrounding or facing residential districts, or adversely affect the safe vision and operation of vehicles moving on public or private roads, highways, or parking areas. Light shall not directly shine or reflect on or into residential structures.
J) All buildings shall have a sign providing the numeric address for identification purposes to assist in fire and safety protection. Such signs shall not require a zoning permit but shall otherwise conform to the standards of this article and shall be subject to the standards of Section 12.08 (Signs or Changes Not Requiring a Zoning Permit).
K) Signs on Awnings, Canopies, Fascia, or Marquees
1) Awnings, canopies, fascia, or marquees shall be designated as permanent parts of the building and shall meet all of the requirements of all applicable building and electrical codes.
