Article X 
BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT 

10.01 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT: A five (5) person Board of Adjustment and three (3) alternates will be appointed by the Precinct Commissioners as provided by RSA 673 and 673:3. The board may, upon application: 
A. Review and decide on alleged error in administrative finding, or B. 
Review and decide on request for special exception, or 

C. Grant a variance. 
10.02 SPECIAL EXCEPTION is an allowable use of property or building that may be permitted under this ordinance only upon formal application to the Zoning Board of Adjustment and subject to the approval of the Board when such use would not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare and only in particular cases where the words "special exception" in this ordinance pertain. A special exception shall be allowed if the following conditions are met: 
A. 	The specific site is an appropriate location for such a use. 
B. 	Property values in the district will not be reduced by such a use. 
C. 	No nuisance or unreasonable hazard shall result. 
D. 	Adequate and appropriate facilities will be provided for the proper operation and maintenance of the proposed use. 
E. 	For District 1, in particular, reference to general welfare shall include special regard for the historical values of the District. 
10.03 VARIANCE as defined in RSA 674:33, is a relaxation of the terms of this ordinance granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment on appeal as long as it is not contrary to the public interest, and, if owing to special conditions, literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. 
10 	March 25, 2010 
The Zoning Board of Adjustment may, on an appeal, grant a variance from the provisions of the 
ordinance if the Board of Adjustment finds all the following conditions and such finding is 
specified in its decision: 
A. 	No diminution in value of surrounding properties would be suffered; 
B. 	Granting the permit would be of benefit to the public interest; 
C. 	Denial of the permit would result in unnecessary hardship to the owner seeking it; D. By granting the permit substantial justice would be done; and 
E. The use must not be contrary to the spirit of the ordinance. 
In determining whether the applicant meets the above five conditions, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall consider the following criteria as an aid to its deliberations: 
1. 	
There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located. 

2. 	
Because of such physical circumstance or conditions there is no possibility that the property can be used in strict conformity with the provisions of this ordinance for a permitted use of the applicant's choice and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property. 

3. 	
If authorized, the variance will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property nor be detrimental to the public welfare. 

4. 	
If authorized, the variance will represent the minimum variance that will afford reasonable relief; and 

5. 	
The spirit of the ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. 


In authorizing a variance, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions and 
safeguards, as it deems necessary to protect the neighborhood and the community, including, 
but not limited to, a time limit when the variance will expire if not utilized. 
10.04 	ADDITONAL INFORMATION: The Zoning Board of Adjustment may require the applicant to submit other information it deems necessary to its reaching a decision regarding application for a special exception or variance. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may also engage a qualified professional consultant of its choice to provide such additional information and opinion as may assist the Board in its deliberations. The applicant shall pay the cost of obtaining such additional information. 
10.05 	FEES will be set by the Zoning Board of Adjustment and shall be sufficient to cover the expenses of the Board.

Section 1: Authority and Purpose 
1.1 Authority 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Planning Board by the voters of the Town of Haverhill, New Hampshire on March 9, 1971 and in accordance with the provisions of RSA 674, Sections 35-44, the Haverhill Planning Board adopts the following regulations governing the subdivision of land in the Town of Haverhill, New Hampshire. 
1.2 Purpose 
The purpose of these regulations is 
a) To provide against such scattered or premature subdivision of land as would involve danger or injury to health, safety, or prosperity by reason of the lack of water supply, drainage, transportation, schools, fire protection, law enforcement, or other public services, or necessitate the excessive expenditure of public fund of such for the supply of such services. 
b) To provide for the harmonious development of the municipality and its environs. 
c) To require the proper arrangement and coordination of streets within subdivisions in relation to other existing or planned street or with features of the official map of the community. 
d) To ensure and protect open and common spaces. 
e) To require suitably located streets of sufficient width to accommodate existing and prospective traffic and to afford adequate light, air and access for firefighting apparatus and equipment to buildings, and be coordinated so as to compose a convenient system. 
f) To require that plats showing new streets or narrowing or widening of existing 
streets submitted to the Planning Board for approval shall show any open space. 
g) May require that proposed parks shall be of reasonable size for neighborhood 

playgrounds or other recreational uses. 
h) To require that land indicated on plats submitted to the Planning Board shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to health and safety. 
i) To prescribe minimum areas of lots to assure conformance with local adopted 
ordinances and to assure needed size for each lot for on-site sanitary facilities. 
j) To include provisions which will tend to create conditions favorable to health, 

safety, convenience or prosperity. 
k) To provide for efficient and compact subdivision development which promotes retention and public usage of open space and wildlife habitat, by allowing for village plan alternative subdivision as defined in RSA 674:21, VI. 
l) 	To include provision for waiver of any portion of the regulations in such cases where, in the opinion of the Planning Board, strict conformity would pose an unnecessary hardship to the applicant and waiver would not be contrary to the spirit and intent of the regulations. 
1.3   General Information 
Planning Board approval of a proposed subdivision is required before any contract for the sale of, or offer to sell, rent or lease such subdivision or any part thereof shall have been negotiated, before any road construction, or building is begun, and before any permit for the erection of a structure within such subdivision shall be granted.  The establishment of a condominium under RSA 356-B including contractible condominiums, conversion condominiums and convertible land and space shall constitute a subdivision under these regulations to the same extent that a physically identical project, development or action under a different form of ownership would constitute a subdivision hereunder.   
Appendices include forms for the administration of these subdivision regulations. 
Section 2: What is a Subdivision? 
To modify existing property boundary lines in the Town of Haverhill, an applicant must receive approval of the Planning Board. There are three types of boundary line transactions: 1) Voluntary Lot Merger, 2) Lot Line Adjustment and 3) Subdivision. In the case where a parcel is being divided into two or more lots, the applicant would apply for subdivision approval. 
A Subdivision is further classified as either Major or Minor. 
A Major Subdivision will in general involve the dividing of a lot into: 1) more than three lots, or 2) two or more lots that will require road construction to provide frontage for all lots. 
A Minor Subdivision would typically involve the division of land into three or fewer lots that do not require new roads, utilities or other municipal improvements. 
Section 3: The Process 
3.1 Overview 
The process for obtaining subdivision approval from the Haverhill Planning Board involves a series of steps discussed below. Voluntary Lot Mergers and Lot Line Adjustments, although not Subdivisions, are covered in these regulations and are also discussed. 
3.1.1 Major or Minor Subdivision: 
A recommended, but not required, first step of the approval process for a Major or Minor Subdivision is to discuss the project in a Pre-Application Consultation with the Planning Board at a regular meeting. This gives the applicant an opportunity to present the project while receiving comments and suggestions from the Board to facilitate the project. An optional Design Review meeting with the Planning Board may be held.  
Next, a Subdivision Application is prepared for submission to the Planning Board. The Application, accompanied by the required fees, is submitted to the Planning Board Office. In addition to information about the project, the application also requires a list of abutters to be notified, and four (4) copies of a Final Plat Layout Plan. 
At that time, one copy of the application and a copy of the Final Layout will be made available by the Planning Board in the Planning Board Office for public review. 
All proposed roads within a major subdivision require a current NH registered-licensed engineer designed plan of street/ road construction, bridge construction, and utilities within a major subdivision as a condition for Planning Board approval. 
A public hearing on the application will be held at a regularly scheduled Planning Board meeting. The applicant then appears before the Board to have the Application accepted. Part of that process is reviewing the Checklist for Plat Contents prior to the Hearing. Once accepted, the Application is now open for discussion by the Board. The need for changes or added information, etc. that may arise could require the applicant to return. In that case, the Public Hearing is continued to the next regular Planning Board meeting. 
Upon approval by the Planning Board, a Final Plat of the applicant’s plan would be stamped and signed by the Planning Board and recorded at the Grafton County Registry of Deeds. 
3.1.2 Voluntary Lot Mergers and Lot Line Adjustments 
Voluntary Lot Mergers and Lot Line Adjustments, though not technically subdivisions, deal with lot boundary lines. By statute they require the approval of the Planning Board, and are included in this Regulation. 
3.1.2.1 Lot Line Adjustment 
A recommended, but not required, first step for a Lot Line Adjustment might be to discuss the proposed change with the Planning Board at a regularly scheduled meeting. 
A complete Application is submitted to the Planning Board Office accompanied by the required fees. In addition to information about the project, the application also requires a list of abutters to be notified. A Public Hearing is required. A Preliminary Layout is optional; a copy of the appropriate Tax Map would be of help at the hearing. 
The Application is posted in the Planning Board Office for public review prior to the noticed Public Hearing to be held at a regularly scheduled Planning Board meeting. 
The applicant, or the applicant’s designee then appears before the Planning Board to have the Application accepted. Once accepted at the Public Hearing, discussion is entertained. After approval of the Application at a Public Hearing, a Final Plat of the Applicant’s Plan shall be produced for recording at the Grafton County Registry of Deeds. 
Upon approval by the Planning Board, a Final Plat of the applicant’s plan would be stamped and signed by the Board and registered with the Grafton County Registry of Deeds following the 30-day reconsideration period and receipt of all application and recording fees. The reconsideration period may be waived at the risk of applicant. 
3.1.2.2 Voluntary Lot Merger 
To bring about a Voluntary Lot Merger, the Applicant(s) make(s) a request to the Planning Board using the appropriate form. No new survey plat need be recorded, but a notice of the merger, sufficient to identify the relevant parcels and endorsed in writing by the Planning Board or its designee, shall be filed for recording in the Grafton Country Registry of Deeds as defined by RSA 674:39-a.  
3.1.3   Key Steps 
Table 1 below shows Key Steps for each of the approval processes. Detailed explanations of the Steps are presented in the following sections. Appendix B contains a checklist to aid Applicant and Appendix C has a copy of the required forms.

7. Final Plat Requirement  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  
8. Final Approval and Recording  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  

3.2 Preliminary Consultation and Review (Pre-Application) 
3.2.1 Preliminary Consultation 
A Preliminary Consultation is an optional meeting. Prior to the formal submission of a final application, the Applicant may appear informally to discuss the proposed subdivision at a regular meeting of the Planning Board. Such discussion may occur without formal public notice and shall be directed toward reviewing: basic concepts of the proposal, conformance with Town Master Plan and Zoning Regulation(s), Subdivision Regulations as they may apply to this proposal, determination of the proposal as a major or minor subdivision, and conformance with state and local requirements. 
Preliminary consultation and review shall not bind the applicant or the Planning Board. However, no discussion beyond the Preliminary Consultation shall take place without public notice. The Planning Board must receive notice of a requested preliminary consultation by noon on the Friday prior to the scheduled Planning Board meeting.  The Planning Board will not consider or discuss a preliminary project unless the request for consultation has been received by the time and day noted above. 
3.2.2 Design Review 
The Design Review is an optional meeting. It is in effect a second phase of a Pre-Application Consultation. A Design Review would afford parties the opportunity to explore and expand details to promote understanding of the project. Abutters and the public are notified (at the expense of the Applicant) to participate. Specific details of the planned boundary line transaction(s) and design(s) would be discussed. Design Reviews have proven helpful for all parties involved on ambitious projects and shall not bind the Applicant or the Planning Board. 
3.3 Filing and Submission of Final Application 
A complete Application for Subdivision must be filed at the Planning Board Office at least fifteen days prior to a scheduled public meeting of the Planning Board. At that time, a copy of the Application and final layout plat will be made available at the Planning Board Office for public review. The Application shall be submitted for acceptance to the Planning Board at a regularly scheduled public meeting pending due notification to Applicant, abutters and the public. A completed Application must include the following: 
a) Name and Address of Applicant 
b) Name of Subdivision, if applicable 
c) Location 
d) Tax Map and Lot Number 
e) Total Acreage 
f) Number of proposed lots 
g) Name and Address of Licensed NH Surveyor 
h) Names and Addresses of Abutters as defined by RSA 672:3 
i) Payment to cover filing fees, mailing, advertising, recording and other costs as 
deemed necessary 
j) Four paper print copies of the final plan (plat) 
k) All information listed in Section 3.6, Final Plat Requirements 
INCOMPLETE APPLICATIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED 
3.4 Fees 
Application for Subdivision must be accompanied by a filing fee. Filing fees include, but are not limited to: Application for Subdivision Approval Fee, certified mailing costs (to notify abutters) and recording fee. A current schedule of fees will be made available when obtaining a Subdivision Application from the Town Office. 
Failure to pay any fee shall constitute grounds for the Planning Board to terminate further consideration of the application. 
The Planning Board may require special investigative studies, environmental assessments, legal review of documents, administrative expenses, and other items necessary to make an informed decision. The Applicant shall pay the cost of all such expenses prior to the approval of the final plat. 
3.5 Notices 
Notice of the submission of an application for Design Review or Final Plat shall be given by the Planning Board as required under RSA 676: 4 I (d) which states: 
Notice to the applicant, holders of conservation, preservation, or agricultural preservation restrictions, abutters, and the public shall be given as follows: The planning board shall notify the abutters, the applicant, holders of conservation, preservation, or agricultural preservation restrictions, and every engineer, architect, land surveyor, or soil scientist whose professional seal appears on any plat submitted to the board by certified mail of the date upon which the application will be formally submitted to the board. Notice shall be mailed at least 10 days prior to submission. Notice to the general public shall also be given at the same time by posting or publication as required by the subdivision regulations. The notice shall include a general description of the proposal which is the subject of the application and shall identify the applicant and the location of the proposal. For any public hearing on the application, the same notice as required for notice of submission of the application shall be given. If notice of public hearing has been included in the notice of submission or any prior notice, additional notice of that hearing is not required nor shall additional notice be required of an adjourned session of a hearing with proper notice if the date, time, and place of the adjourned session was made known at the prior hearing. All costs of notice, whether mailed, posted, or published, shall be paid in advance by the applicant. Failure to pay such costs shall constitute valid grounds for the planning board to terminate further consideration and to disapprove the plat without a public hearing. 
3.6 Final Plat Requirements

3.7 Approval and Recording of Plat 
3.7.1 Consideration and Action on Final Plat 
Within thirty (30) days of the Planning Board’s receipt of an application it shall vote on whether to formally accept the application as complete.   
Upon receipt of an application for subdivision, the Planning Board shall review it and determine whether or not that development, if approved, could reasonable be construed as having the potential for impact beyond the boundaries of Haverhill.  This regional impact could result from a number of factors, such as, but not limited to the following: 
1. 
relative size or number of lots or units compared with existing stock 

2. 
transportation networks 

3. 
proximity to the borders of a neighboring community 

4. 
anticipated emissions such as light, noise, smoke, odors, or particles 

5. 
proximity to aquifers or surface waters which transcend municipal boundaries 

6. 
shared facilities such as schools and solid waste disposal facilities 


Doubt concerning regional impact shall be resolved in a determination that the development has a potential regional impact. Upon determination that a proposed development has a potential  regional impact, the Planning Board shall afford the Regional Planning Commission and the affected municipalities that status of abutters for the limited purposed of providing notice and giving testimony. Within 72 hours of reaching a decision that a development has regional impact, the Planning Board shall, by certified mail, furnish the Regional Planning Commission with copies of the minutes of the meeting at which the decision was made and copies of the initial project plan and the affected municipalities with copies of the minutes of the meeting at which the decision was made.  At least fourteen (14) days prior to the public hearing, the Planning Board shall notify, by certified mail, all affected municipalities and the Regional  Planning Commission of the date, time, and place of the hearing and the right to testify concerning the development. 
Following the decision to formally accept a final application as complete, the Planning Board shall begin formal consideration of that application.  The Planning Board shall act to approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the application within sixty-five (65) days of the date of acceptance of this application.  At least one public hearing shall be held on an application prior to action by the Planning Board.  The Planning Board may apply to the Board of Selectmen, prior to the expiration of the sixty-five (65) day period for an extension of time not to exceed ninety (90) additional days before acting to approve or disapprove the application or, the subdivider may consent to an extension of time for the Planning Board to act provided that such consent shall be in writing. 
3.7.2 Notice of Action on the Final Plat 
The Planning Board shall notify the subdivider in writing of its actions on the Final Plat. In case of disapproval, the grounds for such disapproval shall be set forth in the Notice of Decision, which shall become part of the records of the Planning Board.  For the purpose of calculating the 30 day period within which to file an appeal under RSA 677:15, the 30 day period will begin with the date on which the Planning Board voted to disapprove the application. In case of approval, the Notice of Decision shall set forth the following: 
1. 	
a copy of any deed restriction submitted by the subdivider and accepted by the Planning Board. Deed restrictions shall be written on the Final Plat 

2. 	
all requirements for off-site improvements

all agreements, if any, between the subdivider and the Planning Board concerning matters not required by these Regulations, but to be performed by the subdivider 

6. 	
a statement that the Subdivision shall be completed and constructed in conformity with the Final Plat and the Regulations 

7. 	
a reference to any surety to be provided by the subdivider as guarantee of performance in construction of the subdivision and any required inspection fees 


3.7.3 Acknowledgement of Receipt of Notice 
The subdivider shall acknowledge receipt of the Notice and acceptance of all provisions set forth therein, and shall return a signed copy of it to the Planning Board for its records. Until such acknowledgement and acceptance has been filed with the Planning Board, no further action shall be taken with regard to the Final Plat.  Failure to acknowledge receipt of Notice of Decision and acceptance within ninety (90) days of mailing of the Notice of Decision will cause approval to lapse. 
3.7.4 Approval with Conditions 
Conditional approval may become final without further public hearing when conditions are: 
1. 	
minor plan changes, whether or not imposed by the Planning Board as a result of public hearing, compliance with which is administrative and does not involve discretionary judgment. 

2. 	
conditions which are in themselves administrative and which involve no discretionary judgment on the part of the Planning Board 

3. 	
conditions with regard to the applicant’s possession of permits and approvals 


granted by other boards or agencies Conditional approval shall lapse if the subdivider shall not comply with all of the requirements set forth in the Notice of Decision and shall lapse if the Final Plat is not recorded at the Registry of Deeds.  Approval of Final Plat shall lapse if such Plat is not recorded in the Registry of Deeds within three years from the date of acknowledgement and acceptance of the Notice of Decision unless the Board extends the time. 
3.7.5 Failure of the Planning Board to Act Within the Specified Time Limit 
The subdivider, upon failure of the Planning Board to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the application within the time specified, may obtain from the Selectmen an order directing the Planning Board to act within thirty (30) days.

satisfactory to it, or (2) cash or financial instruments endorsed to the Town and deposited in the name of the Planning Board, or (3) irrevocable letter of credit. 

2. 	
Where electric lines or other utilities are to be installed by a corporation, municipal department or public utility, a letter of intent shall be required stating that the work will be done within one (1) year without expense to the Town. 

3. 	
The Planning Board may recommend a maximum extension of 12 months to the guaranteed performance period when the applicant can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Planning Board and other interested officials or agencies, good cause for such extension. Such recommendation for extension shall be referred to the Board of Selectmen for determination. 

4. 	
No lots shall be sold by the applicant until all required improvements as specified in the final plan to the subdivision and not covered by a performance bond or other security have been completed and inspected, including the complete construction of any new road(s) to Town standards as certified by the Road Agent. Such certification shall in no way obligate the Board of Selectmen to accept said road as a Town maintained road. 1 

5. 	
The performance bond shall not be released until the Board of Selectmen have certified completion of the required improvements in approved subdivision plans, and those deeds covering the land to be used for public purposes, easements and rights-of-way, and rights-to drain are submitted in a form satisfactory to Town Counsel. 


3.9 Inspection Services 
The Planning Board shall require inspection services for all major subdivisions which include street and/or utility line construction or for other subdivisions at the Planning Board’s discretion. The cost of the inspection services shall be borne by the subdivider. Some subdivision projects may require full time inspection services depending on the size of the subdivision, sensitive areas in or near the subdivision.  The Planning Board may require the inspection services to be provided by either Town employees or agents or by an outside consulting, civil engineering firm of the Planning Board’s choice.  If the Planning Board determines the need for inspection services and requires such as a condition of Final Plat approval, then prior to the start of construction the subdivider shall establish an escrow account for the inspection services from the Town.  The subdivider shall maintain a positive balance in the account at all times during construction to cover the expenses for inspection services or be subject to enforcement measures.  Any remaining balance in the account after final approval of the improvements by the Town shall be refunded to the subdivider. 
3.10 Offers of Cession 
The applicant shall tender offers of cession in a form certified as satisfactory by the Town Counsel of all land included in streets, highways, or open space not specifically reserved by him; however, approval of the plat by the Planning Board shall not constitute acceptance by the Town of the dedication of any street, highway, park or other public open space.

       Exaction for the Cost of Off-Site Improvement Needs 
The Planning Board may require the developer to pay an exaction for the cost of off-site improvement needs as determined by the Planning Board to be necessary for the occupancy of any portion of a development. For the purpose of this regulation, “off-site improvements” means those improvements that are necessitated by a development by which are located outside the boundaries of the property that is subject to a subdivision plat or site plan approved by the Planning Board.  Such off-site improvements shall be limited to necessary highway, drainage and sewer and water upgrades pertinent to that development.  The amount of such exaction shall be a proportional share of Town improvement costs not previously assessed against other developments, which is necessitated by the development, and which is reasonably related to the benefits accruing to the development from the improvements financed by the exaction. 
Upon written notification accompanied with the appropriate funds from the developer, an “Off-Site Improvement Study” to determine the exaction to be paid by the developer will be completed either by Town Officials or by an appropriate planning consultant/ contracted service. This report must be accepted and approved by the Planning Board prior to final approval of the proposed development.  The cost of the study will include any investigations and associated costs reasonably necessary to determine the exaction cost as a part of the development approval process.  The developer will pay an estimated “Off-Site Improvement Study” cost prior to the initiation of the study, and if the completed study costs more than the estimation, the developer will be assessed the difference and if the study is less than the cost estimation, the developer will be refunded the difference. 
(Section 4.2.1 adopted  January 3, 2006)

The Gravel Material Specifications can be wavered by having a gradation and sieve analysis test done at the owners expense for comparison to this spec. (determined by Planning Board’s representative) 
4.5.2.3.1     Density Testing 
The density of gravel and crushed gravel courses shall be determined by AASHTO T191 (Sand-Cone Method) or AASHTO T238 (Nuclear Methods).  The density of crushed stone base courses shall be determined by AASHTO T238 (Nuclear Methods) The density shall not be less than 95 percent of the maximum density as determined by AASHTO 99 (Standard Proctor Test) or a control strip. 
4.5.2.4 Drainage 
Surface water shall be disposed of by means of culverts of sufficient capacity at watercourses as determined by standard hydraulic design methods and by construction for a longitudinal storm drainage system to relieve water in ditch sections. Any natural drainage ways and their easements shall be incorporated so that no flooding will occur, or cause water to be routed to adjacent property, and that surface water be disposed of properly and legally. 
4.5.2.5     Erosion Control 
Erosion shall be controlled by placing seeding and mulching or equivalent thereof on all surfaces disturbed by construction of the roadway and on all other surfaces where there is danger of eroded material being carried to the roadway area or watercourse. 
4.5.2.6     Construction Supervision and Inspection 
Each road is to be considered individually. Developers and contractors are required to meet with the Board of Selectmen or their agent and the Road Agent before beginning construction. All work and material require the approval of the Board of Selectmen or its agent and the Road Agent. Inspection of roads under construction shall be made by the Road Agent at the beginning and end of each phase.  It is the responsibility of the developer, contractor, owner, or owner’s agent to notify the Road Agent at the beginning and end of each phase of construction.  This inspection is required. The sole purpose of said inspections is to determine if Town road construction standards and the Board of Selectmen conditions or those conditions set by agents of the Board of Selectmen are met. The Road Agent is not to act as engineer for the applicant. The cost of such inspections by the Road Agent shall be billed to the applicant and payment to the Town for such costs shall be a condition of subdivision approval.  The Town retains the right to hire a third-party consultant and it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to cover all costs incurred. The Planning Board or Road Agent may request the Selectboard or the Select board’s Agent to issue a Cease and Desist Order if it is determined that the construction violates these Subdivision Regulation, State Statute, NH DOT Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, Design Plans or other conditions set by the Planning Board. 
4.5.2.6.1 Design-Approved Road Plans 
Design-Approved Road Plans shall meet road standards and conditions set forth in these Subdivision Regulations, NH DOT Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction as amended and other criteria that may be required by the Planning Board or Road Agent. Design approved plans shall include: detailed Road Cross Sections at 50 foot road length intervals to include required conditions and standards per Subdivision Regulations and adopted reference standards, stabilization information, water lines (when required), sewer (when required), road material used in the road, drainage, fabric as needed, and other considerations as determined by the Planning Board or Road Agent.  Haverhill Road Construction standards addressing materials, compaction of base material, sieve analysis of sub base and base materials and other road construction conditions are located in Haverhill Subdivision Regulations and NH DOT Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, as amended.  Construction phases (Phase I – Sub Grade, Phase II – Bank Run Gravel, Phase III – Crushed Gravel, and Phase IV – Pavement as Required) must be included in Design Plans.  Design Plan Phases shall incorporate and identify location of all utilities including, but not limited to water and sewer. 
4.5.2.7       Subdivision As-Built Plans 
Before signing and recording of the Final Plat, or release of bond or other security, the owner(s) shall have prepared and submitted as-built plans to the Planning Board. As-Built Plans will be approved only if differing changes from the Design Plan have been approved by the Planning Board or the Planning Board’s agent. These plans should show as-built locations and elevations in a contrasting color (preferably red ink) on a print of the original road design or Final Plat. The as-built road plans shall show as-built centerline or street elevations, as-built drainage systems including culverts, catch basins, drainage easements, as-built guardrail and sign locations, and final grading showing swales and ditches. The as-built plan shall show the location of sewer and drain Y-branches, laterals, manholes, catch basins, hydrants, valves, curb shutoffs, and final grades showing swales and ditches. Plans shall also show easements and dedicated roads.  Approval of a subdivision does NOT imply or stipulate that subdivision roads will be maintained by the Town of Haverhill or be accepted as Town of Haverhill public road(s).  Acceptance of roads (private to public) for town maintenance or other purposes is a separate approval procedure through the Haverhill Selectboard. 
4.5.2.8 Road Description 
If the road is to be dedicated to the Town, a meets and bounds description prepared by a New Hampshire licensed surveyor shall be submitted to the Board of Selectmen. Accompanying the legal description shall be a certification by the owner’s surveyor that the right-of-way bounds have been set at the locations shown on the road design plan. 
4.5.3     Private Roads 
In the event that a road is planned and designed as a private road, it must still meet Town road specifications as set forth herein. For all major subdivisions, this provision cannot be waived. For subdivisions of less than 50 trips per day, the Road Agent, or a designee, will perform daily inspections at the expense of the applicant (see 4.5.2.6) of all work done. For subdivisions generating 50 or more trips per day, a full-time, on-site clerk, approved of by the Road Agent or a designee, shall be required during all road construction. All findings and observations of the on-site clerk shall be reported to the Road Agent or designee. The cost of said on-site clerk shall be borne by the applicant.    
The Road Agent and the Town Highway Advisory Committee shall perform a final inspection to determine the private road meets town specifications. Refer to Table 2 Minimum Geometric and Structural Guides for Local Roads and Streets and NH DOT Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, as amended. 
The owner(s) of any private road shall furnish the Planning Board with a notarized letter of the owner’s legal responsibility for construction and maintenance of that road. Notice of that legal responsibility must also be on the Plat recorded in the Grafton County Registry of Deeds. Be advised that a driveway, by definition, can only serve one lot serve no more than two (2) lots and not extend onto another abutting lot.  
Definition: Driveway: A private way that serves not more than two (2) lots. 
The approval of a private road as a public maintained road is not a responsibility of the Planning Board. This is a responsibility of the Selectboard and that elected body must also consider other town-wide issues other than road standards as a part of the approval process. 
4.6 Utilities 
All subdivisions shall make adequate provision for water supply, sanitary sewage  disposal, and required utilities and improvements. The installation of all such utility systems and any damages to existing systems shall be at the expense of the applicant. All utility systems shall be installed underground, unless waived by the Planning Board. 
The Planning Board may require an extension of public water and sewers to and within a proposed subdivision, without cost to the Town or Village District, where existing lines are, in the sole judgment of the Planning Board, within a reasonable distance of the proposed subdivision. 
The Planning Board may require installation of street lighting in any subdivision where it deems it necessary. 
Water and sewer mains shall be constructed beyond the road and shoulder width wherever possible. Any disturbance of roads and/or shoulder for the installation of water or sewer mains or lines will require complete restoration to specifications in Section 4.6.1 following. 
The applicant shall install laterals from all utilities in the street right-of-way to 10 feet beyond the street property line of each building lot. All lateral utility installations under existing Town roads or roads to be dedicated to the Town will require sleeves. Open cuts are not permitted on paved Town roads without the expressed written permission of the Road Agent. 
All utility systems shall be placed in conformity with the terms and specifications of the utility company involved; if the utility company requires an easement to provide service, no final approval shall be granted by the Planning Board until such easements are secured. If no easements are required, a letter of intent to provide service from the utility company must accompany the application. 
Where underground utilities are to be furnished from a public source, all necessary mains, branch offsets to each lot, and fire hydrants shall be installed by the applicant, as approved by the corporation or municipal department having jurisdiction, and to the satisfaction of the Board of Selectmen, and without expense to the Town. 
4.6.1 Restoration Requirements for Utility Installations

APPLICANT LETTER 

Dear Applicant: 
Attached is a copy of the Haverhill Subdivision Regulations and an Application Form. Please read them carefully. No boundary line transaction of land can be recorded at the Grafton County Registry of Deeds without first being approved by a vote of the Haverhill Planning Board. A Preliminary Consultation is recommended by Board, but is not required. A Design Review may also be held with the Board before the Application is submitted to the Board. 
There are three types of boundary line transactions a property owner may choose from: Voluntary Lot Merger, Lot Line Adjustment or Subdivision. A Subdivision is divided into two categories: Minor and Major. Please review the Subdivision Regulations to determine the appropriate type of boundary line transaction you seek so you can provide correct and timely information to the Haverhill Planning Board. 
Regardless of the type of boundary line transaction, the Planning Board, by law, cannot act until you provide all of the required information. The Board cannot accept an incomplete application. Please use the attached checklist(s) to ensure that all proper information is being supplied, and to keep track of your application process. A Lot Line Adjustment, Minor Subdivision and Major Subdivision require that a licensed New Hampshire surveyor prepare the planned boundary line transaction while other professionals, such as engineers and soil scientists, may have to be consulted in some cases. You, as the Applicant, must bear all costs connected with reviewing your proposed boundary line transaction. 
Read the Subdivision Regulations carefully, prepare a complete application, and submit your application to the Board at least 15 days prior to a Planning Board Meeting. Your application will be reviewed and acted on is a timely and efficient manner. We look forward to working with you. 
Sincerely, 
Haverhill Planning Board

Dn "'.>
 



SpecjaJ Exceptions:	The specific use of a building or lot	which may be permitted under this Ordinance only upon formal application to the Board of Adjustment. Special exceptions are designed to permit certain types of uses when such a use would not be detrimental to the public health, safety, character and welfare of Haverhill and only in cases where the word "special exception" appears in this ordinance.  A special exception will be allowed if the following general conditions are met along with any other criteria stated in this ordinance:

[a] the specific site is a suitable location for such a use,

[b] property values in Haverhill not be reduced by such a use and the use will not cause undue financial burden to the Town,

[a] poorly drained soils: Water is removed so slowly that the soil is saturated periodically during the growing season or remains wet for long periods. Free water is commonly at or near the surface for long enough during the growing season  that most mesophytic crops cannot be grown unless the soil is artificially drained. The soil is · not continuously saturated in layers directly below plow depth. Poor drainage results from a high water table, a slowly pervious layer within the profile, seepage, nearly continuous rainfall, or a combination of these.

[b] very poorly drained soils: Water is removed from the soil so slowly that free water remains at  or on the surface during most of the growing season. Unless the soil is artificially drained, most mesophytic crops cannot be grown. Very poorly drained soils are commonly level or depressed and are frequently ponded. Yet, where rainfall is high and nearly continuous, they can have moderate or high slope gradients.

5.2	AQUIFER PROTECTION DISTRICT SPECIAI, EXCEPTIONS
The following uses are presumed to pose a significant threat to the aquifer and shall not be permitted unless, after fonnal application to the zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA), the board grants a special exception based on a written finding of  fact that the proposed use will meet  the purpose of this ordinance as
well as iill. of the specific criteria listed for the aquifer
protection  district. A special exception must be granted if the
applicant establishes, beyond a reasonable doubt, that all
criteria for approval have been met. The board, however, may approve a special exception with conditions it finds necessary to meet the purpose and objectives of this ordinance.


A.	Uses Permitted by  Special Exception ju the Aquifer protection District:

Any principal use involving the production, sale, storage, or transportation of fuel oil, gasoline, or other regulated substances.
Car Washes.

generation of regulated substances in quantities greater than those associated with nonnal household use.

B.	procedure for Ohta j n j ng Special EX"cepti on·

The applicant shall first apply to the Board of Selectmen for a building permit for the proposed development. The board of Selectmen will then advise the applicant whether a special exception is required from the Zoning Board of Adjustment.


Pa.6
 



C.	Submj ssjon of Appl i catjon to the Zonjng Board of Adjustment;

In applying for a special exception under this section, the information listed below shall be submitted, along with the application fee with the formal application to the zoning Board of Adjustment:

a.	A map identifying and showing the location of the proposed use.	The map shall include the following information:
1.	north arrow and date.
2.	scale of 1"=100' or larger.
3.	property lines of all affected lots.
4.	aquifer areas on affected lots and abutting lots
if aquifer district crosses the property line of the lot in consideration.
5.	other significant natural features.
6.	existing and proposed manmade structures.
7.	topographic contours of no less than 5' intervals.
a.	precinct/district boundary lines

b.	Names and addresses of abutting property owners.

c.	A complete list of all chemicals, pesticides, fuels, and other potentially regulated substances to be used or stored on the premises in quantities greater than those associated with normal household use.

e.	A sketch map showing proposed location of regulated substances.

f.	Evidence of approval by the NH Department of Environmental Services of any industrial waste treatment or on-site disposal system.

g.	For uses rendering impervious more than 20% of the lot area, a drainage plan including details of all proposed drainage facilities, both on-site and off-site, where applicable.

h.	Maintenance schedule for all grease traps, containment vessels, and other pollution prevention devices used to handle hazardous materials on site.
 



i.	The ZBA may require the applicant to submit other information it deems necessary to judge the potential· damage to the aquifer that may result from the proposed use.	The ZEA may also engage a qualified professional consultant, mutually agreed upon by the Board and applicant, to prepare an environmental impact report. The cost of obtaining any such additional information shall be paid by the applicant.

D.	Criteria for Approval of Special p;xception in Am1ifer protection District:

In making such a determination, the ZEA shall give consideration to the simplicity, reliability, and feasibility of the control measures proposed and the degree of threat to water quality which would.result if the control measures failed. (The use must also be allowed in all other Town ordinance districts.)

Prior to granting a special exception, the Zoning Board of Adjustment must find that all. of the following are true:

a.	The proposed use will not have a detrimental effect on the quality of the groundwater contained in the aquifer by directly contributing to pollution, i.e. by causing an increase in any current ambient water quality parameter, or by increasing the long-term susceptibility of the aquifer to potential pollutants.

b.	Any discharge to groundwater shall be permitted in accordance with NH Code of Administrative Rules, ENV-Ws 410.

c.	The proposed use will not cause a significant reduction in the long-term volume of water recharge to the aquifer, or in the storage capacity of the aquifer.

d.	Provision shall be made to protect against discharge or loss of regulated substances resulting from corrosion, accidental damage, spills, or vandalism through measure

such as: spill control provisions in the vicinity of chemical or fuel delivery points; secured storage areas for regulated substances; and indoor storage provisions for corrodible or dissolvable materials.	For operations which allow the evaporation of regulated substances into the interiors of any structures, a closed vapor recovery system shall be provided for each such structure to prevent discharge of contaminated condensate into the groundwater.

e.	Where the premises are partially outside of the Aquifer Protection District, potential pollution sources such as on-site waste disposal systems shall be located outside the District to the extent feasible.


Pa.8
·--------	· ------- -----
 



f.	For any regulated substances to be produced in quantities greater than those associated with normal household use, the applicant must demonstrate the availability and feasibility of disposal methods which are in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws and guidelines.

g.	To the extent practical, all run off from impervious surfaces shall be recharged on the site and diverted towards areas covered with vegetation for surface infiltration.	Dry wells shall be used only where other methods are not feasible, and shall be preceded by oil, grease, and sediment traps to facilitate removal of contaminants.	If runoff must be discharged off-site, discharge shall be contained in the recharge area.

h.	In the case of excavations, earth removal shall not be carried out within four (4)  vertical feet of the seasonal high water table, nor shall the maintenance or refueling of vehicles be allowed on the site.

E.	Review by othe Town AqencjPs:

Upon receipt of the application for a special exception, the ZBA shall transmit one copy each to the Planning Board, Conservation Commission, and Health Officer, for their written reco:mmendations. Failure of those parties to respond in writing, prior to the date of the first hearing, shall indicate approval by said parties. The necessary number of copies of the application shall be furnished by the applicant. The ZBA shall explain any departures from the recommendations, of the other town boards or officials, in its application decision.


ARTICLE VI
WETLAND INCORRECTLY DELINEATED

Where it is determined that an area has been incorrectly delineated as a wetland or that an area not so designated was subsequently found to meet the criteria for wetland designation, the Board of Adjustment shall determine whether the regulations herein have application.

The Board of Adjustment shall make their judgement under this section only upon the determination of a certified soil scientist on the basis of additional on-site investigation that the information contained on the Grafton County Soil survey map is incorrect. All costs for such determination shall be borne by the applicant.

[1] By an approved state program as determined by tlie Secretary of the Interior, or
[2] Directly  by  the. Secretary  of the  Interior  of  states  without
approved programs.

Lowest Floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area [including basement]. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable· solely for the parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such an enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of the Ordinance.

Manufactured Home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term "manufactured home" includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on site for greater than 180 consecutive days. This includes manufactured homes located in a manufactured home park or subdivision.

Manufactured home park or subdivision  means  a parcel  (or  contiguous  parcels)  of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

Mean Sea Level means the National Geodetic Vertical Datum [NGVD] of 1929 or other datum to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
 
New Construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

100-	Year Flood    see Base Flood

Permitted Use - a use of property which is allowed by right in Haverhill.

Recreational Vehicle is defined as:
a.	built on a single chassis;
b.	400 square feet or less when measured a the largest horizontal projection;
c.	designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
d.	designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.

Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.

Special Flood Hazard Area  See Area of Special Flood Hazard.

Structure means for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage thank, that is principally above ground,  as well as a manufactured home.

Start of Construction includes substantial improvements, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement or permanent construction of a structure on site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; not does it include excavation  for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; not does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure.

Substantial Damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged conditions would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
 
Substantial Improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements  to a structure in which the  cumulative costs equal  or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure. The market value of the structure should equal" [1] the appraised value prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or [2] in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the structural part of the building  commences,  whether  or not that  alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repairwork performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary,  or safety code specifications  which are solely necessary  to assure safe living conditions or any alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."

Variance is a permit authorizing a use of property which is contrary to the Ordinance. Variances may be granted by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with RSA 674:33 in cases where, owing to the specific conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of the Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done.

Water Surface Elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum [NGVD] of 1929, [or other datum, where specified] of floods of various magnitudes and frequenciesin the floodplains.



ARTICLE IV
FLOODPLAIN  DEVELOPMENT  DISTRICT

The regulations in this Ordinance shall be considered part of NH RSA 674 for purposes of administration and appeals under  state law. If any provision  of this Ordinance differs or appears to conflict with any provision of any other ordinance or regulation, the provision, imposing the greater restriction or more stringent standard shall be controlling.

The following regulations in the Ordinance shall apply to all lands designated as special flood hazard areas by the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] in its "Flood Insurance Study for the Town of Haverhill, New Hampshire" together with the associated Flood Insurance Rate Maps dated                                , which are declared to be a part of this Ordinance and are hereby incorporated by reference.

4.1	All proposed development in any special flood hazard areas shall require a permit.

4.2	The building inspector shall review all  building  permit  applications  for new construction or substantial improvements to determine  whether proposed   building   sites  will  be  reasonably   safe  from   flooding.   If a
 
proposed building site is located in a special flood hazard area, all new construction or substantial improvements shall:

[i]		be designed [or modified] and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy,

[ii]       be constructed with materials resistant to flood damages,

[iii]	be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages,

[iv]		be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities that re designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or acclllTI.ulating within the components during conditions of flooding.



4.3	Where new or replacement water and sewer  systems [including on-site systems] are proposed in a special flood hazard area the applicant shall provide the Building Inspector with assurance that these systems will be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the .systems unto flood waters, and on-site waste disposal systems will be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during period of flooding.

4.4	For all new or substantially improved  structures located in Zones A and AE, the applicant shall furnish the following information to the building inspector:

[a] the as-built elevation [in relation to NGVD] of the  lowest floor [including basement] and include whether or not such structures contain a basement.

[b] if the structure has been floodproofed, the as-built elevation  [in relation to NGVD] to which the structure was floodproofed.

[c]        any certification of floodproofing.

The  Building  Inspector  shall  maintain  for  public  inspection,  and  shall  furnish  such information upon request.

4.5	The Building Inspector shall not grant a building permit until the applicant certifies that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies
 
from which approval is required by federal or state law, including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U. S. C. 1334.

4.6	Wetlands in the Flood Hazard Area

1.	In riverine situations, prior to the alteration or relocation of  a watercourse the applicant for such authorization shall notify the Wetlands	Bureau of the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services and submit copies of such notification to the Building Inspector, in addicting to the copies required by RSA
482 A: 3. Further, the applicant shall be required to submit copies of said notification to those adjacent communities as determined by the Building Inspector, including notice of all scheduled hearings before the Wetlands Board and the Haverhill Conservation Commission.

Wetland:		Defined as those areas which are delineated as poorly drained	or very poorly drained soils by the United states Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service in the Soil Survey Map of Grafton County as amended.

[a] poorly drained soils: Water is removed so slowly that the soil is saturated periodically during the growing season or remains wet for long periods. Free water is commonly at or near the surface for long enough during the growing season  that most mesophytic crops cannot be grown unless the soil is artificially drained. The soil is · not continuously saturated in layers directly below plow depth. Poor drainage results from a high water table, a slowly pervious layer within the profile, seepage, nearly continuous rainfall, or a combination of these.

[b] very poorly drained soils: Water is removed from the soil so slowly that free water remains at  or on the surface during most of the growing season. Unless the soil is artificially drained, most mesophytic crops cannot be grown. Very poorly drained soils are commonly level or depressed and are frequently ponded. Yet, where rainfall is high and nearly continuous, they can have moderate or high slope gradients.

5.2	AQUIFER PROTECTION DISTRICT SPECIAI, EXCEPTIONS
The following uses are presumed to pose a significant threat to the aquifer and shall not be permitted unless, after fonnal application to the zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA), the board grants a special exception based on a written finding of  fact that the proposed use will meet  the purpose of this ordinance as
well as iill. of the specific criteria listed for the aquifer
protection  district. A special exception must be granted if the
applicant establishes, beyond a reasonable doubt, that all
criteria for approval have been met. The board, however, may approve a special exception with conditions it finds necessary to meet the purpose and objectives of this ordinance.


A.	Uses Permitted by  Special Exception ju the Aquifer protection District:

Any principal use involving the production, sale, storage, or transportation of fuel oil, gasoline, or other regulated substances.
Car Washes.
Disposal, processing, or recycling of regulated substances. Septage lagoons.

generation of regulated substances in quantities greater than those associated with nonnal household use.

B.	procedure for Ohta j n j ng Special EX"cepti on·

The applicant shall first apply to the Board of Selectmen for a building permit for the proposed development. The board of Selectmen will then advise the applicant whether a special exception is required from the Zoning Board of Adjustment.


Pa.6
 



C.	Submj ssjon of Appl i catjon to the Zonjng Board of Adjustment;

In applying for a special exception under this section, the information listed below shall be submitted, along with the application fee with the formal application to the zoning Board of Adjustment:

a.	A map identifying and showing the location of the proposed use.	The map shall include the following information:
1.	north arrow and date.
2.	scale of 1"=100' or larger.
3.	property lines of all affected lots.
4.	aquifer areas on affected lots and abutting lots
if aquifer district crosses the property line of the lot in consideration.
5.	other significant natural features.
6.	existing and proposed manmade structures.
7.	topographic contours of no less than 5' intervals.
a.	precinct/district boundary lines

b.	Names and addresses of abutting property owners.

c.	A complete list of all chemicals, pesticides, fuels, and other potentially regulated substances to be used or stored on the premises in quantities greater than those associated with normal household use.

d.	A description of regulated substances to be generated, indicating storage and disposal methods, accompanied by a description of measures proposed to protect all storage.

e.	A sketch map showing proposed location of regulated substances.

f.	Evidence of approval by the NH Department of Environmental Services of any industrial waste treatment or on-site disposal system.

g.	For uses rendering impervious more than 20% of the lot area, a drainage plan including details of all proposed drainage facilities, both on-site and off-site, where applicable.

h.	Maintenance schedule for all grease traps, containment vessels, and other pollution prevention devices used to handle hazardous materials on site.
 



i.	The ZBA may require the applicant to submit other information it deems necessary to judge the potential· damage to the aquifer that may result from the proposed use.	The ZEA may also engage a qualified professional consultant, mutually agreed upon by the Board and applicant, to prepare an environmental impact report. The cost of obtaining any such additional information shall be paid by the applicant.

D.	Criteria for Approval of Special p;xception in Am1ifer protection District:

In making such a determination, the ZEA shall give consideration to the simplicity, reliability, and feasibility of the control measures proposed and the degree of threat to water quality which would.result if the control measures failed. (The use must also be allowed in all other Town ordinance districts.)

Prior to granting a special exception, the Zoning Board of Adjustment must find that all. of the following are true:

a.	The proposed use will not have a detrimental effect on the quality of the groundwater contained in the aquifer by directly contributing to pollution, i.e. by causing an increase in any current ambient water quality parameter, or by increasing the long-term susceptibility of the aquifer to potential pollutants.

b.	Any discharge to groundwater shall be permitted in accordance with NH Code of Administrative Rules, ENV-Ws 410.

c.	The proposed use will not cause a significant reduction in the long-term volume of water recharge to the aquifer, or in the storage capacity of the aquifer.

d.	Provision shall be made to protect against discharge or loss of regulated substances resulting from corrosion, accidental damage, spills, or vandalism through measure

such as: spill control provisions in the vicinity of chemical or fuel delivery points; secured storage areas for regulated substances; and indoor storage provisions for corrodible or dissolvable materials.	For operations which allow the evaporation of regulated substances into the interiors of any structures, a closed vapor recovery system shall be provided for each such structure to prevent discharge of contaminated condensate into the groundwater.

e.	Where the premises are partially outside of the Aquifer Protection District, potential pollution sources such as on-site waste disposal systems shall be located outside the District to the extent feasible.


Pa.8
·--------	· ------- -----
 



f.	For any regulated substances to be produced in quantities greater than those associated with normal household use, the applicant must demonstrate the availability and feasibility of disposal methods which are in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws and guidelines.

g.	To the extent practical, all run off from impervious surfaces shall be recharged on the site and diverted towards areas covered with vegetation for surface infiltration.	Dry wells shall be used only where other methods are not feasible, and shall be preceded by oil, grease, and sediment traps to facilitate removal of contaminants.	If runoff must be discharged off-site, discharge shall be contained in the recharge area.

h.	In the case of excavations, earth removal shall not be carried out within four (4)  vertical feet of the seasonal high water table, nor shall the maintenance or refueling of vehicles be allowed on the site.

E.	Review by othe Town AqencjPs:

Upon receipt of the application for a special exception, the ZBA shall transmit one copy each to the Planning Board, Conservation Commission, and Health Officer, for their written reco:mmendations. Failure of those parties to respond in writing, prior to the date of the first hearing, shall indicate approval by said parties. The necessary number of copies of the application shall be furnished by the applicant. The ZBA shall explain any departures from the recommendations, of the other town boards or officials, in its application decision.


ARTICLE VI
WETLAND INCORRECTLY DELINEATED

Where it is determined that an area has been incorrectly delineated as a wetland or that an area not so designated was subsequently found to meet the criteria for wetland designation, the Board of Adjustment shall determine whether the regulations herein have application.

The Board of Adjustment shall make their judgement under this section only upon the determination of a certified soil scientist on the basis of additional on-site investigation that the information contained on the Grafton County Soil survey map is incorrect. All costs for such determination shall be borne by the applicant.








Pg.9
 


ARTICLE VII
VERIFICATION OF AQUIFER PROTECTION DISTRICT BOUNDARY

When the actual boundary of the Aquifer Protection District is disputed by any owner or abutter affected by said boundary, the Zoning Board of Adjustment, at the owner or abutter's request and expense, may engage the services of a professional hydrogeologist to determine the precise boundary of said district.

The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have the authority to make the final determination as to the location of a disputed boundary and may define the boundary or area designation based thereon.

ARTICLE VIII
NON-CONFORMING USES

8.1	wetlands Conservation District·

If at any time after the adoption of the Wetland ordinance, any land, building or structure is being used in a lawful manner, except that such use is not in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance, such non-conforming use of said land, building or structure may be continued. No interruption of such a non­ conforming use shall prevent its continuance except as hereinafter provided in the following paragraph.

Whenever a non-conforming use has been discontinued for more than one	year for any reason, such non-conforming use shall not thereafter be re-established, and the future use of the property shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.

Any non-conforming use permitted may be expanded upon only by the approval of the Board of Adjustment, which shall first ascertain that [a] such an expansion does not create a greater nuisance	or detriment and [b] the expanded use meets the requirements of this Ordinance.
