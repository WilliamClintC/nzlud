and general welfare of the residents of the Village of Williamsville by
reducing the number of avoidable alarms of fire, intrusion, holdup or other
emergencies which contribute to ineffective utilization of police and fire
emergency agencies, require emergency responses which are susceptible
to high accident rates, interfere with genuine emergencies (responses) and

the meanings respectfully ascribed to them by this section:

to detect smoke, abnormal rise in temperature, fire, medical emergency or

prerecorded message to an emergency agency.
EMERGENCY AGENCY  The Town of Amherst Police Department or

DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW FEES
§ 21-1. Title.
The title of this chapter shall be "Development Plan Review Fees."
§ 21-2. Legislative findings; intent and purpose.
The Village Board hereby finds and determines that in order to protect
and safeguard the Village of Williamsville, its residents and their property
with respect to certain land developments within the Village, all should be
designed and constructed in a competent and workmanlike manner and in
conformity with all applicable governmental codes, rules and regulations
and dedicated and conveyed to the Village in a legally sufficient manner. In
order to assure the foregoing, it is essential that the Village have available
to it all necessary professional expertise to assist in the review of plans,
designs, applications and related materials in order to make
recommendations to the Village Board, Planning Board and Zoning Board
of Appeals. The Village of Williamsville takes great pride in the skill and
professionalism of its staff. However, from time to time the staff is called
upon to review and evaluate matters outside the range of staff training.
These situations may require the Village to seek out skills not possessed
by the Village employees but which are not required frequently enough
to justify the hiring of new staff. At the same time, the cost of retaining
such outside expertise should not be borne by the taxpayers of the Village,
but rather by those who seek to profit from the decisions of the Village
and its boards. Therefore, it is the intent of this chapter to establish a
mechanism whereby the Village may hire necessary expertise that is needed
infrequently without imposing the cost on its taxpayers.
§ 21-3. Statutory authority; local supersession.
This chapter is enacted under the authority of Subparagraphs (a)(12) and
(d)(3) of the Municipal Home Rule Law § 10(1)(ii) and Municipal Home Rule
Law § 22. To the extent that the Village Law of the State of New York does
not authorize the Village Board, Village Planning Board and Zoning Board
of Appeals to require the reimbursement to the Village of expenses incurred
by the Village in connection with the professional review of applications
for development and land use approvals, it is the expressed intent of the
Village Board to change and supersede such statutes. More particularly,
such statutes do not authorize the deferral or withholding of such approvals
in the event such expenses are not paid to the Village. It is the expressed
C. In the event of the refusal or failure of the record owner to comply with
the completion order of the Village Board, the record owner shall be
subject to a fine in an amount not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars
($250.) per day until full compliance with said order is certified by the
Code Enforcement Official.

to empower the Village to require such payment as part of the approval
process.

As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:

1:70
Village of Williamsville, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
§ 31-11. Designation of local administrator.
The Code Enforcement Enforcer of the Village of Williamsville, or such
other individual as designated by the Village Board of Trustees, is hereby
appointed local administrator to administer and implement this chapter by
granting or denying floodplain development permits in accordance with its
provisions.
§ 31-12. Floodplain development permits; fees.
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in the Village of Williamsville for the purpose of
protecting its citizens from increased flood hazards and insuring that
new development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its
exposure to flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development
in an area of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map enumerated in § 31-6, without a valid floodplain development
permit. Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by
the local administrator and may include, but not be limited to, plans, in
duplicate, drawn to scale and showing: the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location
of the foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee in an amount established from time
to time by resolution of the Board of Trustees. In addition, the applicant
shall be responsible for reimbursing the Village for any additional costs
necessary for review, inspection and approval of this project. The local
administrator may require a deposit of no more than $500 to cover
these additional costs.
C. Application for a permit. The applicant shall provide the following
information as appropriate. Additional information may be required on
the permit application form.
(1) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest
floor (including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially
improved structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH, or
Zone A if base flood elevation data are available. Upon completion
of the lowest floor, the permitee shall submit to the local
administrator the as-built elevation, certified by a licensed
professional engineer or surveyor.
§ 31-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 31-12
1:71
§ 31-13. Duties and responsibilities of local administrator.
Duties of the local administrator shall include, but not be limited to the
following.
(2) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any
new or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be
floodproofed. Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the
structure, the permitee shall submit to the local administrator the
as-built floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer
or surveyor.
(3) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 31-15C, Utilities.
(4) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the
floodproofing criteria in § 31-17, Nonresidential structures.
(5) A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by
a licensed professional engineer must be submitted that
demonstrate that the altered or relocated segment will provide
equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. The
applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
to revise the documents enumerated in § 31-6, when notified by the
local administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed
by FEMA for this purpose. The applicant must also provide
assurances that the conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated
stream segment will be maintained.
(6) A technical analysis, prepared by a licensed professional engineer,
if required by the local administrator, which shows whether
proposed development to be located in an area of special flood
hazard may result in physical damage to any other property.
(7) In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from
other sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the
permit applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments (including proposals for manufactured home and
recreational vehicle parks and subdivisions) that are greater than
either 50 lots or five acres.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 31-12C, Application for a permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
§ 31-12 WILLIAMSVILLE CODE § 31-13
1:72
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of § 31-14, General construction standards,
and, in particular, § 31-14A, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
§ 31-14, General construction standards, no permit shall be issued.
The applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.
(1) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated
areas of special flood hazard on the Village's Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation data
(these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor identified
a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 31-12C(7), as criteria for requiring that
new construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
(3) When an area of special flood hazard, base flood elevation, and/or
floodway data are available from a federal, state or other
authoritative source, but differ from the data in the documents
enumerated in § 31-6, the local administrator may reasonably
utilize the other flood information to enforce more restrictive
development standards.
C. Alteration of watercourses.
§ 31-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 31-13
1:73
(1) Notification to adjacent municipalities that may be affected and the
New York State Department of Environmental Conservation prior
to permitting any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and
submit evidence of such notification to the Regional Administrator,
Region II, Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage.
(1) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
structure, obtain from the permit holder a certification of the asbuilt
elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, in
relation to mean sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by or
under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by same. For manufactured
homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation
upon placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of
elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it
remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is
fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the applicant's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 31-9 of this chapter.

Indemnification of Officers and Employees
[Adopted 4-28-1980 as L.L. No. 5-1980]
§ 67-1. Legislative intent.11
The purpose of this Article is to provide legal and financial protection for
those individuals serving the Village of Williamsville for losses from civil
actions which may be brought against them in their individual capacity
for actions taken while in the performance of their official duties and
responsibilities. In enacting this Article, the Board of Trustees does not
intend to limit or otherwise abrogate any existing right or responsibility of
the village or its employees with regard to indemnification of legal defense.
It is solely the intent of this Article to provide similar coverage for local
employees as is presently provided for state employees so as to continue to
attract qualified individuals to local government service.
§ 67-2. Terminology.
As used in this Article, unless the context otherwise requires, the term
"employee" shall mean any person holding a position by election,
appointment or employment in the service of the Village of Williamsville,
whether or not compensated, or a volunteer expressly authorized to
participate in a municipally sponsored volunteer program, but shall not
include an independent contractor. The term "employee" shall include a
former employee, his estate or judicially appointed personal representative.
§ 67-3. Conditions for defense.
A. Upon compliance by the employee with the provisions of § 67-5, the
village shall provide for the defense of the employee in any civil action
or proceeding in any state or federal court arising out of any alleged act
or omission which occurred or is alleged in the complaint to have
occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his public
employment or duties or which is brought to enforce a provision of
Section 1981 or 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code. This duty to
provide for a defense shall not arise where such civil action or
proceeding is brought by or on behalf of the Village of Williamsville.
B. Subject to the conditions set forth in Subsection A, the employee shall
be entitled to be represented by the Village Attorney; provided,
however, that the employee shall be entitled to representation by
private counsel of his choice in any civil judicial proceeding whenever
the Village Attorney determines, based upon his investigation and
review of the facts and circumstances of the case, that representation
by the Village Attorney would be inappropriate, or whenever a court of
competent jurisdiction, upon appropriate motion or by a special
proceeding, determines that a conflict of interest exists and that the

§ 67-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 67-3
1:109
§ 67-4. Duties of employee.
employee is entitled to be represented by private counsel of his choice.
The Village Attorney shall notify the employee in writing of such
determination that the employee is entitled to be represented by
private counsel of his choice. The Village Attorney may require, as a
condition to payment of the fees and expenses of such representation,
that appropriate groups of such employees be represented by the same
counsel. If the employee or group of employees is entitled to
representation by private counsel under the provisions of this section,
the Village Attorney shall so certify to the Village Board. Reasonable
attorneys' fees and litigation expenses shall be paid by the village to
such private counsel from time to time during the pendency of the
civil action or proceeding, subject to certification that the employee is
entitled to representation under the terms and conditions of this section
by the head of the department, commission, division, office or agency
in which such employee is employed and upon the audit and warrant
of the Village Treasurer. Any dispute with respect to representation
of multiple employees by a single counsel or the amount of litigation
expenses or the reasonableness of attorneys' fees shall be resolved by
the court upon motion or by way of a special proceeding.
C. Where the employee delivers process and a request for a defense to the
Village Attorney as required by § 67-5, the Attorney shall take the
necessary steps, including the retention of private counsel under the
terms and conditions provided in § 67-5, on behalf of the employee to
avoid entry of a default judgment pending resolution of any question
pertaining to the obligation to provide for a defense.
A. The village shall indemnify and save harmless its employees in the
amount of any judgment obtained against such employees in any state
or federal court, or in the amount of any settlement of a claim, provided
that the act or omission from which such judgment or settlement arose
occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his public
employment or duties; the duty to indemnify and save harmless
prescribed by this subsection shall not arise where the injury or
damage resulted from intentional wrongdoing or recklessness on the
part of the employee.
B. An employee represented by private counsel shall cause to be
submitted to the Board of Trustees any proposed settlement which may
be subject to indemnification by the village, and if not inconsistent with
the provisions of this section, the Mayor shall certify such settlement
and submit such settlement and certification to the Village Attorney.
The Attorney shall review such proposed settlement as to form and
amount and shall give his approval if in his judgment the settlement is
in the best interest of the village. Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to authorize the village to indemnify or save harmless an
employee with respect to a settlement not so reviewed and approved by
the Village Attorney.
§ 67-3 WILLIAMSVILLE CODE § 67-4
1:110
§ 67-5. Cooperation of employee.
The duty to defend or indemnify and save harmless provided by this Article
shall be conditioned upon delivery to the Village Attorney or his assistant,
at his office, by the employee of the original or a copy of any summons,
complaint, process, notice, demand or pleading within five (5) days after
he is served with such document, and upon the full cooperation of the
employee in the defense of such action or proceeding and in the defense
of any action or proceeding against the state based upon the same act
or omission and in the prosecution of any appeal. Such delivery shall be
deemed a request by the employee that the village provide for his defense
pursuant to this Article.
§ 67-6. Rights not affected.
The benefits of this Article shall inure only to employees as defined herein
and shall not enlarge or diminish the rights of any other party, nor shall any
provision of this Article be construed to affect, alter or repeal any provision
of the Workers' Compensation Law.
§ 67-7. Rights of insurers presented.
The provisions of this Article shall not be construed to impair, alter, limit
or modify the rights and obligations of any insurer under any policy of
insurance.
§ 67-8. Time of effect.
The provisions of this Article shall apply to all actions and proceedings
pending upon the effective date thereof or thereafter instituted.
§ 67-9. Statutory provisions not affected.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Article, the provisions of
this Article shall not be construed in any way to impair, alter, limit, modify,
abrogate or restrict any immunity available to or conferred upon any unit,
entity, officer or employee of the village, or any right to defense and/or
indemnification provided for any governmental officer or employee by, in
accordance with or by reason of any other provision of state or federal
statutory or common law.
C. Upon entry of a final judgment against the employee or upon the
settlement of the claim, the employee shall cause to be served a copy of
such judgment or settlement, personally or by certified or registered
mail within thirty (30) days of the date of entry or settlement, upon the
Mayor; and if not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, such
judgment or settlement shall be certified for payment by such Mayor. If

shall be paid upon the audit and warrant of the Village Treasurer.

§ 81-39. Notification of discharge of hazardous waste.
A. Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the engineer of record, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division
Director and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any
discharge into the sanitary sewer facilities of a substance which, if
otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261.
Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set
forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more
than 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of such waste per calendar month to
the sanitary sewer facilities, the notification also shall contain the
following information to the extent that such information is known and
readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged
during that calendar month and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the
following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180
days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this
subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste
discharged. However, notifications of other changed conditions must
also be submitted under § 81-35 of this chapter. The notification
requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already
reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under
the self-monitoring requirements of §§ 81-31, 81-33 and 81-34 of this
chapter.
B. Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Subsection A above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms (33 pounds) of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).
Discharge of more than 15 kilograms (33 pounds) of nonacute
hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the
user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do
not require additional notification.
C. In the case of any new regulations under 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the engineer of
record, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director
and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
D. In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall
certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity

E. This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder or any applicable federal or state law.
A. Except as indicated in Subsection B below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques. In the event that flow proportional sampling is infeasible,
the engineer of record may authorize the use of time proportional
sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the
effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to
show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
B. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides

techniques.
A. The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes or wastes from commercial establishments shall, if
required by the engineer of record, install a suitable control manhole
together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of
the wastes. Such manhole shall be accessible and safely located and
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the engineer of
record. The manhole shall be installed by the owner, at his expense, and
shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
B. If the source of a discharge in violation of this chapter cannot be
differentiated due to limited sampling locations, it shall be the
responsibility of the property owner to provide adequate sampling
location(s), as designated by the engineer of record, in order to
§ 81-39 WILLIAMSVILLE CODE § 81-42
1:184
§ 81-43. Sampling.
All sampling shall be performed at the control manhole provided. In the
event that no special manhole is available, the engineer of record may
consider the control manhole to be the nearest downstream manhole in
the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
The engineer of record must approve this sample point in writing. All
measurements, tests and analysis shall be performed by a town-approved
laboratory at the expense of the user.
§ 81-44. Timing.
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
§ 81-45. Recordkeeping.
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter
and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling
and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques
or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall
remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the
user or the Village, or where the engineer of record has specifically notified
the user of a longer retention period.

§ 81-46. Right of entry for inspection and sampling.
Authorized representatives of the Village of Williamsville and
representatives from the USEPA and NYSDEC bearing proper credentials
and identification shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes
of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and review and copying
of records, analytical data and charts related to wastewater discharge
monitoring in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
§ 81-47. Search warrants.
If the engineer of record has been refused access to a building, structure
or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause
to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program of the Village of Williamsville designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the
overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the
engineer of record may seek issuance of an order or warrant from a court
of appropriate jurisdiction.
A. Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that,
upon presentation of suitable identification, the engineer of record will
be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing
specific responsibilities.
B. The engineer of record shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
C. The engineer of record may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to
measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at a minimum
of once per year to ensure their accuracy.
D. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by
the user at the written or verbal request of the engineer of record and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne
by the user.
E. Unreasonable delays in allowing the engineer of record access to the
user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.

Confidential Information
§ 81-48. Availability of information to public; restrictions.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits and
monitoring programs and from the engineer of record's inspection and
sampling activities shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the engineer of record, that the release of such information
would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets under applicable state or federal law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or
data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report
that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report
which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available
immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the
SPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not
be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public
without restriction.

ARTICLE IX
Significant Noncompliance
§ 81-49. Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
A. The engineer of record shall publish annually, in the largest daily
newspaper delivered in the municipality where the sanitary sewer
facilities is located, a list of the users which, during the previous 12
months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.
B. The term "significant noncompliance" shall mean:
(1) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken
during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or
average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
(2) Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds
the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit
multiplied by the applicable criteria [1.4 for BOD, TSS (unless
approved as surchargeable by the engineer of record), fats, oils and
grease and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH];
(3) Any other discharge violation that the engineer of record believes
has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass through, including endangering the health of
sanitary sewer facilities personnel or the general public;
(4) Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent
endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted
in the engineer of record's exercise of his emergency authority to
halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5) Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction or attaining final compliance;
(6) Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines,
periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with
compliance schedules;

ARTICLE X
Administrative Enforcement Remedies
§ 81-50. Notification of violation.
When the engineer of record finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
the engineer of record may serve upon that user a written notice of
violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof,
to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the
engineer of record. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the engineer
of record to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
§ 81-51. Consent orders.
The engineer of record may enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement
with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include
specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within
a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as any other administrative orders issued pursuant to
§§ 81-53 and 81-54 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
§ 81-52. Show-cause hearings.
The engineer of record may order a user which has violated or continues
to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
to appear before the Village Board and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement
action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user or its
representative or representatives show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall
be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least 20 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served
on any authorized representative of the user. A show-cause hearing shall
not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user.
§ 81-53. Compliance orders.
When the engineer of record finds that a user has violated or continues
to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
§ 81-50 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 81-53
1:193
the engineer of record may issue an order, to the user responsible for the
discharge, directing that the user come into compliance within a specified
time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided,
sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.
Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including
any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
§ 81-54. Cease-and-desist orders.
When the engineer of record finds that a user has violated or continues
to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the engineer of record
may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the user to immediately comply with all
requirements and take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as
may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of
a cease-and-desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
§ 81-55. Administrative fines.
A. When the engineer of record finds that a user has violated or continues
to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the engineer of record may fine such user in an amount
not to exceed $10,000. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation,
per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period
of violation.
B. Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after 15 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and
interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 9% per month. A lien against
the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines and
penalties.
C. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the
engineer of record to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the
fine amount within 15 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request
has merit, the engineer of record may convene a hearing on the matter.
In the event that the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together
§ 81-53 WILLIAMSVILLE CODE § 81-55
1:194
§ 81-56. Emergency suspensions.
with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The
engineer of record may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
D. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
E. In determining the amount of the above fines, the engineer of record
may consider factors such as, but not limited to, the nature of the
violations; the magnitude of impact on human health, the environment
and/or the Village's collection and treatment operations caused by the
violation; the user's past violation record; and other relevant factors.
F. Each day on which a violation is found to occur or continue shall be
deemed a separate and distinct offense. A day shall consist of a twentyfour-
hour period beginning at 12:01 a.m. and ending the following
12:01 a.m.
A. The engineer of record may immediately suspend a user's discharge,
after oral, telephone or other notice to the user, whenever such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The engineer of
record may also immediately suspend a user's discharge that threatens
to interfere with the operation of the sanitary sewer facilities or which
presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
(1) Any user notified of an immediate suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a
user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the engineer of record may take such steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, at no cost to the Village, to prevent or minimize
damage to the sanitary sewer facilities or its receiving stream or
endangerment to any individuals. The engineer of record may allow
the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the engineer of record that the
period of endangerment has passed and payment is made for all
damages resulting from the discharge.
(2) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and
the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the
engineer of record prior to the date of any show-cause hearing.
B. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior
to any emergency suspension under this section.
§ 81-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 81-57
1:195
§ 81-57. Termination of discharge.
A. In addition to the provisions in § 81-28 of this chapter, any user who
violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(1) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
(3) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
(5) Violation of the pretreatment standards in Article II of this chapter.
B. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge
and be offered an opportunity to show cause, under § 81-52 of this
chapter, why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this
option by the engineer of record shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
§ 81-57 WILLIAMSVILLE CODE § 81-57
1:196
ARTICLE XI
Judicial Enforcement Remedies
§ 81-58. Injunctive relief.
When the engineer of record finds that a user has violated or continues
to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
the engineer of record may commence an action in a court of appropriate
jurisdiction through the Village Attorney for the issuance of a temporary
or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the
specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other
requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The engineer
of record may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/
or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
§ 81-59. Civil penalties.
§ 81-60. Criminal prosecution.
Any person who shall maliciously or willfully break, damage, destroy,
uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment
which is part of the Sanitary Sewer facilities shall be subject to prosecution
and a penalty not to exceed $1,000 per day of violation or imprisonment for
not more than one year, or both, in addition to civil damages incurred with
such acts.
A. A user who has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the
Village for a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per day of violation. In the
case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
B. The engineer of record may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court
costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities,
including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual
damages incurred by the Village.
C. In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of
the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation,
corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and
any other factor as justice requires.
D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
§ 81-58 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 81-61
1:197
§ 81-61. Remedies nonexclusive.
The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. Enforcement
of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the Village's
enforcement response plan. The engineer of record may take any, all or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant user.
§ 81-61 WILLIAMSVILLE CODE § 81-61

ARTICLE XII
Supplemental Enforcement Action
§ 81-62. Performance bonds.
The engineer of record may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater
discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision
of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such
user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the Village of Williamsville,
in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the engineer of record to be
necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
§ 81-63. Liability insurance.
The engineer of record may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater
discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision
of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the
user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient
to restore or repair damage to the sanitary sewer facilities caused by its
discharge.
§ 81-64. Public nuisances.
A violation of any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected
or abated as directed by the engineer of record. Any person(s) creating a
public nuisance shall be liable to the Village of Williamsville for any costs
incurred in removing, abating or remedying said nuisance.
§ 81-65. Contractor listing.
Users, which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements, are not eligible to receive a contractual award
for the sale of goods or services to the Village. Existing contracts for the
sale of goods or services to the Village held by a user found to be in
significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards or requirements
may be terminated at the discretion of the engineer of record.
§ 81-62 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 81-65
1:199

ARTICLE XIII
Affirmative Action to Discharge Violations
§ 81-66. Upsets.
A. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the
reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly
designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of
preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of Subsection C, below, are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs or other relevant evidence, that:
(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset.
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation
and maintenance procedures.
(3) The user has submitted the following information to the engineer of
record within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five days.
(a) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance.
(b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue.
(c) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E. Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance
with categorical pretreatment standards.
F. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary
to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
§ 81-66 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 81-66
1:201
§ 81-67. Prohibited discharge standards.
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in § 81-6A of this
chapter or the specific prohibitions in § 81-6B of this chapter if it can prove
that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through
or interference and that either:
§ 81-68. Bypass.
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or
fails.
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass
through or interference; or
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in
nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the town
was regularly in compliance with its SPDES permit and, in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
A. For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
BYPASS  The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion
of a user's treatment facility.
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE  Substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to
become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural
resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence
of a bypass. "Severe property damage" does not mean economic loss
caused by delays in production.
B. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These
bypasses are not subject to the provision of Subsections C and D of this
section.
C. Notice to engineer of record.
(1) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the engineer of record, at least 10 days before the
date of the bypass, if possible.
(2) A user shall submit oral notice to the engineer of record of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
§ 81-66 WILLIAMSVILLE CODE § 81-68
1:202
standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of
the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within
five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its
cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times,
and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time
it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce,
eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The engineer of
record may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the
oral report has been received within 24 hours.
D. Conditions for bypass.
(1) Bypass is prohibited and the engineer of record may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage;
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated
wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment
downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup
equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which
occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and
(c) The user submitted notices as required under Subsection C of
this section.
(2) The engineer of record may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the engineer of record
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in
Subsection D(1) of this section.

§ 81-71. (Reserved).
§ 81-72. Pretreatment charges and fees.
The Village may adopt charges and fees, which may include:
§ 81-73. Industrial agreements.
No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the Village and any industrial
concern whereby abnormal industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the Village for treatment, subject to payment
therefor by the industrial user. However, in no event will a waiver be
granted which could result in a violation of any federal, general or
categorical standard or prohibition.
§ 81-74. Deleterious or surchargeable waste.
If any water or wastes are discharged or proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain abnormal-strength sewage or which,

may:
A. Reject the wastes;
B. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers;
C. Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
D. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges. BOD, TKN, TSS
and phosphorous may be considered as surchargeable parameters, if
prior approval is given by the engineer of record. When the engineer of
record determines the volume and character of such wastes to
otherwise be in compliance with all pertinent federal, state and local
regulations and all other provisions of this chapter, and not to cause
overloading of the town's facilities, then approval for such discharge
may be granted subject to payment of a surcharge determined by the
engineer of record.

discharged into the MS4 any materials other than stormwater except as
provided below. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal
discharge to the MS4 is prohibited except as described as follows:
§ 81-82. Illicit connections prohibited.
A. The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this article, unless NYSDEC or the Village has

exempt discharges shall be made in accordance with an appropriate
plan for reducing pollutants.
B. Discharges approved, in writing, by the SMO to protect life or property
from imminent harm or damage, provided that such approval shall not
be construed to constitute compliance with other applicable laws and
requirements, and further provided that such discharges may be
permitted for a specified time period and under such conditions as the
SMO may deem appropriate to protect such life and property while
reasonably maintaining the purpose and intent of this article.
C. Dye testing in compliance with applicable state and local laws is an
allowable discharge with a verbal notification to the SMO prior to the
time of the test.
D. The prohibition of illegal discharges shall not apply to any discharge
permitted under a SPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order
issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of
NYSDEC, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws
and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted
for any discharge to the MS4.
A. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the MS4 is prohibited.
§ 81-81 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 81-82
1:209
§ 81-83. Activities contaminating stormwater prohibited.
§ 81-84. Prevention, control and reduction of stormwater pollutants
by use of best management practices.
Best management practices. Where the SMO has identified illicit discharges
or an activity contaminating stormwater, as defined in § 81-83 of this article,
the Village may require implementation of BMPs to control those illicit
discharges and activities.
B. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection
was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the
time of connection.
C. A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a
connection to continue.
A. Activities that are subject to the requirements of this section are those
types of activities that:
(1) Cause or contribute to a violation of the Village's MS4 SPDES
stormwater discharge permit; or
(2) Cause or contribute to the Village being subject to the special
conditions.
B. Such activities include improper management of pet waste or any other
activity that causes or contributes to violations of the Village's MS4
SPDES stormwater discharge permit authorization.
C. Upon notification to a person that he or she is engaged in activities that
cause or contribute to violations of the Village's MS4 SPDES
stormwater discharge permit authorization, that person shall take all
reasonable actions to correct such activities such that he or she no
longer causes or contributes to violations of the Village's MS4 SPDES
stormwater discharge permit authorization.

nonstructural BMPs to reduce or eliminate the source of pollutant(s) to
the MS4.
§ 81-82 WILLIAMSVILLE CODE § 81-84
1:210
§ 81-85. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the Village prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
§ 81-86. Suspension of access to MS4.
§ 81-87. Access to facilities; monitoring of discharges.
C. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the
provisions of this section.
A. Illicit discharges in emergency situations. The SMO may, without prior
notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, to the health or welfare of people, or to the MS4. The
SMO shall notify the person of such suspension within a reasonable
time thereafter, in-writing, of the reasons for the suspension. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the SMO may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to people.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have his or her
MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator, in writing, of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor. The
violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its
recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines, writing, that
the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to reoccur. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to the premises
terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the
SMO.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this article, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,
or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which
constitutes a violation of this article.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to
§ 81-84 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 81-87
1:211
§ 81-88. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the Village, in person or by telephone
determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security
measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records as may be required to implement this
article.
(3) The Village shall have the right to set up on any facility subject to
this article such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the SMO
to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater
discharge.
(4) The Village has the right to require the facilities subject to this
article to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably necessary
to determine compliance with this article. The facility's sampling
and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own
expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality
shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) An unreasonable delay in allowing the SMO access to a facility
subject to this article is a violation of this article. A person who is
the operator of a facility subject to this article commits an offense if
the person denies the SMO reasonable access to the facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this
article.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this article or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.

or facsimile, no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or
by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed
to the Village within three business days of the telephone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain
an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent
its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
§ 81-89. Enforcement; penalties for offenses.
A. Notice of violation. When the SMO finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, he or she may
order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible
person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
(1) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(2) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
(3) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected

including the imposition of a criminal fine, as provided in
Subsection B; and
(6) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. If
abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
B. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this article
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $350 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both, for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense, both of

A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within five
business days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the
decision of the SMO, then the SMO shall request the owner's
permission for access to the subject private property to take any and all
measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore
the property.
B. If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek a
warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter
upon the property to determine whether a violation has occurred. Upon
determination that a violation has occurred, the SMO may seek a court
order to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property. The cost of implementing and
maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the
discharger.
C. In the event that the Village incurs cost and expense in the enforcement
of this article or in the remediation of any violation hereof, the party
found to be in violation shall reimburse the Village for such costs and
expenses. Failure to promptly reimburse may subject the party in
violation to a money judgement. Further, any unpaid costs and expenses
may be relevied against the real property tax bill of the property in
question.

§ 84-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 84-5
1:223
or building may also be administratively reviewed, regardless of
sign type.
(a) Exception: No sign plans or programs shall be eligible for
administrative review on historically designated properties
unless a comprehensive signage package was specifically
agreed upon as part of the original certificate of
appropriateness review by the Historic Preservation
Committee.
B. Administrative review procedures.
(1) The Sign Officer may approve, approve with modifications, or deny
a sign application for any signs listed on Table 84-5 as not requiring
a Planning Board review, or any nonstructural or nondimensional
modifications of a sign previously approved under this chapter
(e.g., sign face changes, awning recoverings, etc.). The Sign Officer
shall issue a sign permit only if the sign conforms to all the
applicable standards and requirements of this chapter as well as
any previous requirements of the Planning Board.
(2) The Sign Officer may, at his or her discretion, refer any sign
application back to the Planning Board for review and/or
determination.
(3) Any sign application decision made by the Sign Officer may be
appealed to the Planning Board by any aggrieved person within 30
days of the date of the permit determination by the Sign Officer.
This appeal should be filed with the Building Department.
C. Planning Board review.
(1) The Planning Board shall review and decide upon all sign
applications received from the Sign Officer, or an appeal to the
Planning Board regarding an application. Such review may occur at
any regularly or specially scheduled Planning Board meeting.

as part of the site plan or architectural review process. In the event
of such review, all required sign permit application materials shall
be provided to the Planning Board as part of the site plan or
architectural review application.
(4) With respect to any sign application subject to its review (including
appeals from a determination by the Sign Officer) the Planning
Board may waive any requirements of this chapter upon a showing
by the applicant that unique characteristics of his or her property
§ 84-5 WILLIAMSVILLE CODE § 84-5
1:224
§ 84-6. Measurement.
render strict application with such requirement(s) impractical and
that such waiver is consistent with the overall intent of this chapter.
(5) Any decision by the Planning Board on a sign application is subject
to judicial review as provided by New York Village Law § 7-740.
D. Review criteria. The review of sign permit applications by the Sign
Officer and Planning Board shall be based upon the following criteria:
(1) The scale, color, texture and materials of the sign will be
compatible with the style, color, texture and materials of the
building on which it is located, but also allow for the keeping of
logo integrity such as a trademark logo design and/or color;
(2) The sign is neither confusing or distracting, nor will it create a
traffic hazard or otherwise adversely impact public safety;
(3) The sign follows the design guidelines outlined in § 84-16 to the
greatest extent practicable; and is otherwise compliant with this
chapter.
A. Sign area.
(1) Single sign face. The area of a sign shall be computed by means of
the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or geometric
combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the
writing, representation, emblem, graphic, and/or other display,
together with any material, backdrop, or structure on which it is
placed. See Figures 1 and 2.
Figure 1: Single Sign Face Area
Figure 2: Individual Letter Sign Area
(2) Multi-faced signs. In the case of a multi-faced sign only one side of
the sign is considered in determining sign area if the sides of the
sign are back-to-back or diverge at an angle of 45° or less.
B. Sign height.
(1) Freestanding sign. The height of a freestanding sign shall be
calculated by measuring the vertical distance between the top part
of such sign or its structure, whichever is highest, to the elevation
of the ground directly beneath the center of the sign. See Figure 3.

Building Code.
F. The erection of any sign, its supports, wiring, or other structural and/or
electrical elements may be subject to inspection and approval by the
Sign Officer.
A. All signs shall be constructed of permanent, weather resistant, and
durable materials, except for banners, flags, temporary signs, and
window signs otherwise in conformance with this chapter.
B. Where applicable, signs shall be supported by sign structures that are
designed to resist wind pressures, dead loads, and lateral loads in
accordance with the appropriate provisions of the New York State
Building Code. All sign supports shall be reviewed as part of the sign
design.
C. All sign lettering shall be permanently affixed to the sign. Manual
changeable copy signs shall be enclosed and locked.
D. No sign may be constructed of untreated, unfinished, or unpainted
wood, or other unfinished materials. All wood components of signs must

§ 84-16. Sign design guidelines.
The following sign design guidelines are intended to provide applicants,
the Sign Officer, and the Planning Board with guidance for best practices
in addressing issues related to sign compatibility, legibility, placement, and
color. Please refer to the Village of Williamsville Sign Design Preferences
Gallery14 for visual depictions of these guidelines.
K. Any sign that is obsolete or abandoned, advertising an activity,
business, product or service no longer conducted or available on the

M. Any monopole sign.
N. Any sign that is mounted on wheels or mounted on any structure on
wheels.
O. Any banner, poster, pennant, ribbon, streamer, spinner, or balloon,
unless otherwise authorized by this chapter.
A. Compatibility.
(1) Signs should be constructed of high quality materials that are
compatible with the building form and the desired character of the
area in which they are located.
(2) Signs should be appropriately scaled for the building or site upon
which they are located, so as not to dominate the facade or
streetscape.
(3) Signs on buildings that have a monolithic or plain facade should be
used to create visual interest through appropriate sign design
features, scale, and proportions.
(4) Signs should be designed to include relief in the lettering or sign
face to create shadows and provide depth and visual interest.
B. Legibility.
(1) Hard to read, intricate typefaces should be avoided. The number of
lettering styles on a single sign should be limited to two for small
signs and three for larger signs.
(2) Letters and words should not be spaced too closely together.
Generally, letters should not occupy more than 75% of the sign
area.

(3) Large areas of blank spaces should be avoided. Generally, 50% or
more blank area should be avoided for boxed sign areas or framed
signs.
(4) Strangely shaped or unnecessarily narrow signs should be avoided.
If an unusual shape is not symbolic it is more likely to be confusing.
C. Placement.
(1) Signs should be so located to respect and complement a building's
facade, utilizing logical signage areas created by existing
architectural details or ornamentation.
(2) Signs should be placed at or near the public entrance to a building
to indicate the most direct access.
(3) Signs located on a building facade should be located in the sign
board area.
D. Color.
(1) Signs should feature substantial contrast between the color and
material of the background and text or symbols.
(2) Sign colors should complement the materials and colors of adjacent
buildings, including accent and trim colors, where applicable.
(3) Use of color and color combinations utilized for signs should be
limited. Generally, a sign should not utilize more than three colors,
including accent colors.
(4) DayGlo or flourescent colors should be avoided.
A. Sign types. The following table indicates the sign types permitted
within the Village's zoning districts, as established in Chapter 112 of

§ 89-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a local law regulating the
use of public streets and sidewalks of the village and the construction,
maintenance, repair and replacement thereof and to establish orderly
A. Any sign that does not comply with this chapter is eligible for
characterization as a legal nonconforming sign if the sign complied with
all requirements in effect at the time it was erected.
B. Nonconforming signs must be brought into compliance with this
chapter under the following conditions:
(1) The sign is altered in any way, such as size, design, structure, or
type of illumination (except for normal maintenance).
(2) The sign is relocated or replaced.
(3) The property or business to which the sign relates changes
ownership or primary use.
C. Any nonconforming sign that is removed from its position or siting and
not replaced in-kind within 60 days shall be presumed to be abandoned
and discontinued, and therefore may not be restored or re-erected
except in compliance with this chapter.
D. No nonconforming sign may be altered in any way that would increase
its nonconformity with the regulations of this chapter, including but not
limited to area, height, setback, and illumination.
E. A nonconforming sign shall not be repaired, reconstructed or replaced,
except in conformity with all the provisions of this chapter if it is
damaged to an extent that the cost of repairing the sign to its former
condition or replacing it with an equivalent sign equals or exceeds 50%
of the replacement value of the sign so damaged, including labor.
F. Nothing in this section shall relieve the owner or user of a
nonconforming sign or owner of the property on which the
nonconforming sign is located from complying with the provisions of
this chapter regarding safety, maintenance and repair of signs. Any
repainting, cleaning, or routine maintenance or repair of the sign or

A. Except as otherwise provided herein or elsewhere in this Code, the
lawful use of land, buildings or structures existing at the date of the
adoption of this chapter, or any amendments thereto, may be continued
although such use, land, building or structure does not conform to the
regulations specified by this chapter for the zone in which such land,
building or structure is located.
B. Any nonconforming use may be changed to any other use permitted in
the district in which it is first permitted. Once a nonconforming use is
changed to a conforming use or to a more restricted use, such use
thereafter shall not revert to a less restricted use.
C. Enlargement. [Amended 10-11-2016 by L.L. No. 6-2016]
(1) A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or extended, except that
in any Mixed Use (MU and NMU) or Manufacturing (M-1) District,
a nonconforming building may be enlarged to an extent not
exceeding 20%, in the aggregate, of the floor area devoted to such
nonconforming use. In no case shall such enlargement extend
beyond the lot occupied by the nonconforming use or violate any
height, yard, parking area or other open space requirement of this
chapter. When the total of all enlargements equals 20% of the floor
area existing at the time the use became a nonconforming use, no
further enlargement shall be permitted.
(2) A nonconforming structure in any single- or two-family residential
home may be enlarged or extended up to 20% or 300 square feet,
whichever is lesser, provided that the enlargement does not
increase the degree of the existing nonconformity and the
enlargement or extension does not create a new nonconformity.
D. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance or
repair of a nonconforming building or structure or use thereof.
E. No alteration, either interior or exterior, shall be made to a
nonconforming building or structure except:
(1) When required by law.
(2) To restore to a safe condition after determination by the Code
Enforcement Official that it is unsafe.
(3) To accomplish enlargements as authorized by this chapter.
(4) To accomplish a change to a conforming use or to a more restricted
use.
F. Any nonconforming building or structure that has been destroyed or
damaged by any means, other than deliberate demolition, shall be
§ 112-10 WILLIAMSVILLE CODE § 112-10
1:368
allowed to be rebuilt and shall maintain its nonconforming status,
provided that:
(1) The total floor area is not increased from the total floor area of the
original nonconforming building or structure.
(2) If any modification shall result in additional parking spaces being
required or proposed, provision for the installation and design of
such parking spaces shall be required by the Planning/
Architectural Review Board as a precondition to approval of
reconstruction.
(3) Reconstruction shall commence within six months of date of
damage or destruction.
G. With respect to any such building or structure located in the R-3M, MU
or NMU Districts, any reconstruction shall be subject to the design
standards set forth in §§ 112-15, 112-16 and 112-17, respectively.
H. Nothing shall prevent the construction of a building or other structure
which is made nonconforming by this chapter or any amendment
thereto, provided that a building permit has been lawfully issued, and
further provided that:
(1) Construction of the foundation shall have commenced prior to the
nonconforming date and completion shall have been diligently
pursued.
(2) The Board of Appeals determines that substantial expenditures
have been made or substantial financial obligations have been
incurred prior to the nonconforming date and completion has been
diligently prosecuted.
I. Abandonment.
(1) In any district, whenever a nonconforming use of land, building or
structure or any part or portion thereof has been discontinued for a
period of six months, such nonconforming use shall not thereafter
be reestablished, and all future uses shall be in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter. Such discontinuance of the active and
continuous operation of such nonconforming use or part or portion
thereof for such period of six months is hereby construed and
considered to be an abandonment of such nonconforming use,
regardless of any reservation of an intent not to abandon the same
or of an intent to resume active operations. If actual abandonment
of the nonconforming use of land and/or buildings is in fact
evidenced by the removal of buildings, structures, machinery,
equipment or other evidences of such nonconforming use, the
abandonment shall be construed to be completed, and all rights to
reestablish or continue such nonconforming use shall be
terminated immediately.

more buildable lots within any district;
(b) Encourage good qualities of exterior design and appearances
and to relate such design and appearances to the sites and
surroundings;

(a) The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power, upon an
appeal from a decision or determination of the administrative
official charged with the enforcement of such local law, to
grant area variances as defined above.
(b) In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
take into consideration the benefit to the applicant if the
variance is granted as weighed against the detriment to the
health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood or community
by such grant. In making such determination the Board shall
also consider:
[1] Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by the granting of the area
variance.
[2] Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be
achieved by some method feasible for the applicant to
pursue, other than an area variance.
[3] Whether the requested area variance is substantial.
[4] Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect
or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in
the neighborhood or district.
[5] Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created; which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Board
of Appeals, but shall not necessarily preclude the granting
of the area variance.
(c) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of area variances, shall
grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and
welfare of the community.
(4) Imposition of conditions. The Board of Appeals shall, in the
granting of both use variances and area variances, have the
authority to impose such reasonable conditions and restrictions as
are directly related to and incidental to the proposed use of the
property. Such conditions shall be consistent with the spirit and
intent of the Zoning Local Law and shall be imposed for the
purpose of minimizing any adverse impact such variance may have
on the neighborhood or community.

A. Findings. It is hereby determined that:
(1) Land development activities and associated increases in site
impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local
watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes,
flooding, stream channel erosion, or sediment transport and
deposition.
(2) This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
water-borne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for
fish and other desirable species.
(3) Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil
erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for
terrestrial and aquatic habitats.
(4) Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation.
(5) Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil,
thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow.
(6) Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts
on the waters of the Village.
(7) Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can
be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater
runoff from land development activities.
(8) The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land
development activities in order to control and minimize increases
in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream
channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with
stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats
to public health and safety.
(9) Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the
adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
§ 112-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 112-28
1:405
B. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and
safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing
within this jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in § 112-28A
of this chapter. This section seeks to meet those purposes by achieving
the following objectives:
(1) Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation State
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) General Permit
for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate Stormwater
Sewer Systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-0-15-003, as amended or
revised; [Amended 11-26-2018 by L.L. No. 13-2018]
(2) Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(SPDES) General Permit for Construction Activities, Permit No.
GP-0-15-003, as amended or revised; [Amended 11-26-2018 by
L.L. No. 13-2018]
(3) Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
(4) Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from
land development activities which would otherwise degrade local
water quality;
(5) Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to the
maximum extent practicable; and
(6) Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater
management practices and ensure that these management
practices are properly maintained and eliminate threats to public
safety.
C. General provisions.
(1) Applicability. This section shall be applicable to all land
development activities.
(2) Exemptions. The following activities shall be exempt from review
under this section:
(a) Agricultural activity.
(b) Silvicultural activity, except that landing areas and log haul
roads are subject to this section.

1:406
(c) Routine maintenance activities that disturb less than five acres
and are performed to maintain the original line and grade,
hydraulic capacity or original purpose of a facility.
(d) Repairs to any stormwater management practice or facility
deemed necessary by the Stormwater Management Officer.
(e) Any part of a subdivision if a plat for the subdivision has been
approved by the Village of Williamsville on or before the

1:413
(a) Erosion and sediment control inspection.
[1] The SMO may require such inspections as necessary to
determine compliance with this section and may either
approve that portion of the work completed or notify the
applicant wherein the work fails to comply with the
requirements of this section and the SWPPP as approved.
To obtain inspections, the applicant shall notify the SMO at
least 48 hours before any of the following, as required by
the SMO:
[a] Start of construction;
[b] Installation of sediment and erosion control measures;
[c] Completion of site clearing;
[d] Completion of rough grading;
[e] Completion of final grading;
[f] Close of the construction season;
[g] Completion of final landscaping; or
[h] Successful establishment of landscaping in public
areas.
[2] If any violations are found, the applicant and developer
shall be notified, in writing, of the nature of the violation
and the required corrective actions. No further work shall
be conducted except for site stabilization until any
violations are corrected and all work previously completed
has received approval by the SMO.
(b) Stormwater management practice inspections. The SMO is
responsible for conducting inspections of SMPs. All applicants
are required to submit as-built plans for any SMPs located on
site after final construction is completed. The plan must show
the final design specifications for all stormwater management
facilities and must be certified by a professional engineer.
(c) Inspection of stormwater facilities after project completion.
Inspection programs shall be established on any reasonable
basis, including but not limited to: routine inspections; random
inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice
of possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas
identified as higher-than-typical sources of sediment or other
contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses or
industries of a type associated with higher-than-usual
discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of
a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to
cause violations of state or federal water or sediment quality
§ 112-28 WILLIAMSVILLE CODE § 112-28
1:414
standards or the SPDES stormwater permit; and joint
inspections with other agencies inspecting under
environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but
are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records;
sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material
or water in drainage control facilities; and evaluating the
condition of drainage control facilities and other stormwater
management practices.
(d) Submission of reports. The SMO may require monitoring and
reporting from entities subject to this section as are necessary
to determine compliance with this section.
(e) Right-of-entry for inspection. When any new stormwater
management facility is installed on private property or when
any new connection is made between private property and the
public stormwater system, the landowner shall grant to the
Village of Williamsville the right to enter the property at
reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose
of inspection as specified in § 112-28H(1) of this chapter.
(2) Performance guarantee.

and faithful completion of all land development activities
related to compliance with all conditions set forth by the
Village of Williamsville in its approval of the SWPPP, the Village
of Williamsville may require the applicant or developer to
provide, prior to construction, a performance bond, cash
escrow, or irrevocable letter of credit from an appropriate
financial or surety institution which guarantees satisfactory
completion of the project and names the Village of
Williamsville as the beneficiary. The security shall be in an
amount to be determined by the Village of Williamsville based
on submission of final design plans, with reference to actual
construction and landscaping costs. The performance
guarantee shall remain in force until the surety is released
from liability by the Village of Williamsville, provided that such
period shall not be less than one year from the date of final
acceptance or such other certification that the facility(ies) has
(have) been constructed in accordance with the approved
plans and specifications and that a one-year inspection has
been conducted and the facilities have been found to be
acceptable to Village of Williamsville. Per-annum interest on
cash escrow deposits shall be reinvested in the account until
the surety is released from liability.
(b) Maintenance guarantee. Where stormwater management and
erosion and sediment control facilities are to be operated and
maintained by the developer or by a corporation that owns or

§ 112-28 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 112-28
1:415
prior to construction, may be required to provide the Village
of Williamsville with an irrevocable letter of credit from an
approved financial institution or surety to ensure proper
operation and maintenance of all stormwater management and
erosion control facilities both during and after construction
and until the facilities are removed from operation. If the
developer or landowner fails to properly operate and maintain
stormwater management and erosion and sediment control
facilities, the Village of Williamsville may draw upon the
account to cover the costs of proper operation and
maintenance, including engineering and inspection costs.
(c) Recordkeeping. The Village of Williamsville may require
entities subject to this section to maintain records
demonstrating compliance with this section.
