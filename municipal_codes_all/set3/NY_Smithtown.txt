BUILDING PERMIT REVIEW BOARD
GENERAL REFERENCES
Building construction  See Ch. 112.
§ 13-1. Legislative intent.
The Town Board finds herewith that as the population of our Town rapidly
increases, the development of residential areas by single building permit
applications should proceed along the lines of good order and with due
regard to the public interest involved and that a reasonable degree of
control should be exercised over the physical improvement of the individual
sites requiring the establishing of special conditions on all sites within
the Town of Smithtown. The neglect to consider surface water drainage,
adequate width of roadways and the relationship of the building lot to
existing public improvements, as well as the consideration of long-range
desired standards for individual building permits which will inure to the
benefit of all the people of the Town of Smithtown, adversely affects the real
property in the area where the building permit is requested, affects the cost
and also destroys the effectiveness of municipal services provided in the
general area and its relation to all the people of a particular section of the
Town. Therefore, for these reasons and others, the following is proposed to
prevent these harmful effects and thus:
A. Protect the established character of the adjoining properties, both
public and private, and of the neighborhood in which they are located.
B. Prevent the depreciation of the value of adjoining properties, both
public and private, and of the neighborhood in which they are located.
C. Lessen and, where possible, prevent traffic congestion on the streets
and highways upon which the site fronts or which provide vehicular or
pedestrian access thereto.
D. Prevent overcrowding of land or buildings.
E. Secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers and provide adequate
light, air and convenience of access.
F. Provide standardization in all areas of the Town of Smithtown in road
width, curbing and drainage.
G. Provide for a constant and known relationship of all building lots to
existing public improvements.
H. Provide that all roadways in the Town will eventually be curbed and
uniform in width, meeting the requirements of state law.

The Town of Smithtown is an equal opportunity employer. The Town is
committed to making all personnel and employment decisions without
regard to age, race, creed, religion, color, sex, national origin, disability,
marital status, citizenship, pregnancy, veterans status, genetic

basis of any of these characteristics, or who believes he or she has been
retaliated against for making a complaint, should immediately report the
incident in accordance with the following procedures.
§ 28-2. Complaint procedures.
A. Any employee who feels that he or she has been the victim of
discrimination in violation of this Equal Employment Opportunity Policy
or has witnessed such activity must immediately report the incident to
his/her department head. Applicants for employment with the Town
should also contact the head of the department in which he/she is
applying for a position. If you feel uncomfortable speaking to the
department head or if you feel your complaint has not been adequately
addressed, please speak to the Town Attorney or the Town Personnel
Officer.
B. All complaints will be investigated in a timely manner.

Town determine it necessary to interview the employee alleged to be
committing the discrimination, where the employee is a member of a
union recognized by the Town, the employee shall be notified of his/her
right to be accompanied by a union representative at such interview.

conflict between the provisions of this chapter and a given officer or

of Ethics pursuant to the provisions as set forth in § 30-9. However, the
§ 30-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-8

No. 1-1992]
Board of Ethics must at all times give the greatest latitude to said
individual's professional code of conduct and, whenever possible,
reconcile the within chapter to complement and respect the individual's
professional code of conduct.
B. Substantial consideration shall be given to the effect that deviation
from an individual's professional code of conduct will have on that
individual's ability to practice his or her profession. If need be, the
Board of Ethics is authorized and required to obtain advisory opinions

situation.
A. Any individual who holds a title as outlined in Appendix A3 of this
chapter and any policymaker or local political party official shall file
with the Board of Ethics of the Town of Smithtown, within 30 days after
taking office or commencing employment or of taking the position of
local political party official or whenever they become affected by the
provisions of this chapter and annually on or before May 15 of every
following year during their terms of office or employment, a financial
disclosure statement. The time for filing such statements may be
extended, pursuant to the rules of the Board of Ethics, for justifiable
cause and/or undue hardship, upon application to the Board of Ethics.
Candidates for local elected office shall file a financial disclosure

confidentiality with regard to parts of his financial statement that have
no relationship to his official duties. An employee may also request an
exemption from any requirement to report items of information which
pertain to such person's spouse and/or unemancipated children.
Confidentiality and/or an exemption may be granted by the Board of
Ethics with regard to such parts that, in the opinion of the Board of
Ethics, pose no conflict of interest and/or have no relationship to the
official duties of the employee. Parts of the statement that are granted
confidential and/or exempt status by the Board of Ethics and categories
of amounts of value shall not be disclosed to the public. [Amended
6-9-2009 by L.L. No. 1-2009]

D. Any part of a financial disclosure statement that has been granted
confidential and/or exempt status by the Board of Ethics pursuant to the
employee's request as well as categories of amounts of value shall be
maintained by the Board of Ethics as confidential information. It shall
be a violation for any Board of Ethics member or any other individual,
except the employee who filed the statement, to disclose any
information that has been granted confidential and/or exempt status or
any category of amounts of value. Such violation shall be punishable by
a fine of not more than $500, as determined by the Board of Ethics.
E. If information granted confidential or exempt status is intermixed with
parts of the statement that will be subject to public inspection, such
confidential or exempt information shall be deleted by the Board of
Ethics from a copy to be made available for any such inspection, and the
original information shall be retained by the Board of Ethics pursuant to
§ 30-9C. [Amended 6-9-2009 by L.L. No. 1-2009]

Board of Ethics has failed to file a disclosure statement or has filed a
deficient statement, the Board of Ethics shall, without undue delay,
notify the reporting person in writing stating the person failed to file
the required statement or detailing the deficiency, provide the person
with a fifteen-day period to cure the deficiency and advise the person of
the penalties for failure to comply with the reporting requirements.
Such notice shall be confidential. If the person fails to make such filing
or fails to cure the deficiency within a specified time period, the Board
of Ethics shall send a notice of delinquency to the reporting person and
to the Town Board. Any such person shall be subject to the adjudicatory
provisions hereof. [Amended 6-9-2009 by L.L. No. 1-2009]
G. Violations; notice and hearing. [Amended 6-9-2009 by L.L. No.
1-2009]
(1) If a reporting person has filed a statement which reveals a possible
violation of this Code of Ethics or the Board of Ethics receives a
sworn complaint alleging such a violation, or if the Board of Ethics
determines on its own initiative to investigate a possible violation,
the Board of Ethics shall notify the reporting person in writing,
describe the possible or alleged violation of such Code of Ethics
and provide the person with a fifteen-day period in which to submit
a written response setting forth information relating to the
activities cited as a possible or alleged violation of law. If the Board
of Ethics thereafter makes a determination that further inquiry is
justified, it shall give the reporting person an opportunity to be
heard. The Board of Ethics shall inform the reporting individual of
its rules regarding the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings and
appeals and the due process procedural mechanisms available to
such individual. If the Board of Ethics determines at any stage of
the proceeding that there is no violation or that any potential
conflict of interest violation has been rectified, it shall so advise the
§ 30-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 30-9
1:27
reporting person and the complainant, if any. All of the foregoing
proceedings shall be confidential.
(2) If the Board of Ethics determines that there is reasonable cause to
believe that a violation has occurred, it shall send a notice of
reasonable cause to the reporting person, to the complainant, if
any, and to the Town Board. Any such person shall be subject to the
adjudicatory provisions hereof.
(3) A reporting individual who knowingly and willfully fails to file an
annual statement of financial disclosure, or who knowingly and
willfully has filed a deficient statement, or who knowingly and
willfully with intent to deceive makes a false statement or gives
information which such individual knows to be false on such
statement of financial disclosure filed pursuant to this chapter shall
assessed a civil penalty in the amount not to exceed $10,000. Such
individual shall also be subject to suspension and/or other
disciplinary action, as the Town Board considers advisable, and/or
upon recommendation of the Board of Ethics. Assessment of a civil
penalty hereunder shall be made by the Board of Ethics with
respect to persons subject to its jurisdiction. The Board of Ethics
may, in lieu of any civil penalty, refer a violation to the District
Attorney for prosecution, and upon such conviction, but only after
such referral, such violation shall be punishable as a Class A
misdemeanor. A civil penalty for false filing may not be imposed
hereunder in the event that a category of value or amount reported
hereunder is incorrect, unless such reported information is falsely
understated. Assessment of a civil penalty shall be final unless
modified, suspended or vacated within 30 days of imposition. With
respect to the assessment of such penalty, upon becoming final,
such penalty shall be subject to review pursuant to Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules.

in light of all the circumstances that assessment of the civil penalty is
not appropriate or if the imposition of civil penalties is not otherwise
authorized by law, the Board of Ethics, in its discretion, may take such
other action as appropriate, including but not limited to a written
admonition or a recommendation that disciplinary action be taken or a
referral to a prosecutor for prosecution of criminal charges. The Board
of Ethics shall forward a copy of such admonition or recommendation
for disciplinary action to the Town Board. [Amended 6-9-2009 by L.L.

alternatives.

§ 36-1 SMITHTOWN CODE § 36-4
1:44
§ 37-1. Policy.
The Town of Smithtown is complying with OSHA Occupational Noise
Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.95, by administering a
continuing, effective hearing conservation program for all Town employees
who are exposed to time-weighted average noise levels of 85 decibels (dB)
or greater during an eight-hour workday or, equivalently, a dose of 50%
measured on the A scale (slow response). Exposures at or above this level
are determined by monitoring the actual noise levels in each workplace area
and estimating the noise exposure or dose received by employees during
that workday.
§ 37-2. Administration.
The Town-wide Hearing Conservation Program is administered and
maintained by the Department of Environment and Waterways. Department
of Environment and Waterways staff have been trained and certified in
community noise control by the New Jersey Rutgers Noise Technical
Assistance Center. The training course consisted of classroom and field
exercises with particular emphasis on the adverse health effects of
excessive noise, noise control and reduction, noise measuring and the
instruction on the proper operation and care of noise-monitoring sound
level meters, dosimeters and octave band analyzers.
§ 37-3. Monitoring.
A. All work operations in the Town which involve noisy conditions and
make normal conversation difficult will be monitored for excessive
noise levels. If the results of preliminary sound level monitoring
indicates that any employee's exposure may equal or exceed an eighthour
time-weighted average of 85 decibels, the Town will develop and
implement a monitoring program. The sampling strategy of the
monitoring program will be designed to identify employees for inclusion
into the Hearing Conservation Program. All continuous, intermittent
and impulsive sound levels from 80 decibels to 130 decibels will be
integrated into any noise measurements taken.
B. Where circumstances such as high worker mobility, significant
variances in sound level or a significant component of impulse noise
make area monitoring generally inappropriate, the Town will use
representative personal sampling to comply with the monitoring
requirements as defined in the OSHA Occupational Noise Standard.
The monitoring of Town workplace areas will be repeated whenever a
change in production, process, equipment or controls increase noise
exposures to the extent that additional employees may be exposed at or
above the action level; or the attenuation provided by hearing
protectors being used by employees may be rendered inadequate to
meet the new increased noise levels.
§ 36-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 37-3
1:45
§ 37-4. Controls.
In the event that employees are subjected to sound levels in excess of OSHA
permissible noise exposures limits, the Town will attempt to reduce the
noise by utilizing feasible administrative or engineering controls. If such
controls are not a viable option or fail to reduce sound levels within the
permissible noise exposure limits, personal protective equipment will be
provided to reduce sound levels to acceptable levels.
§ 37-5. Audiometric testing program.
§ 37-6. Annual audiogram.
§ 37-7. Hearing protectors.
C. The Town will notify each employee exposed at or above an eight-hour
time-weighted average of 85 decibels of the results of monitoring. In
addition, the Town will provide employees or their designated
representatives with an opportunity to observe any noise
measurements conducted.
A. The Town has established and maintains an audiometric testing
program by making audiometric testing available to all employees
whose exposures equal or exceed an eight-hour time-weighted average
of 85 decibels. Audiometric testing is provided at no cost to Town
employees.
B. The audiometric tests are performed by a licensed or certified
audiologist, otolarynogologist or other physician, or by a technician
who is certified by the Council of Accreditation in Occupational Hearing
Conservation. All audiograms are performed in accordance with the
standards set forth in Appendix C and Section (h) of OSHA 29 CFR
1910.95 (Audiometric Testing Requirements).
A. At least annually after obtaining the baseline audiogram, the Town will
obtain a new audiogram for each employee exposed at or above an
eight-hour time-weighted average of 85 decibels.
B. Each employee's annual audiogram will be compared to that employee's
baseline audiogram to determine if the audiogram is valid and if a
standard threshold shift has occurred. OSHA defines a standard
threshold shift as a change in hearing threshold relative to the baseline
audiogram of an average of 10 dB at more than 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000
hertz (Hz) in either ear. Evaluations and follow-up procedures of
audiograms will be performed in accordance with Section (g)(7) and (8)
of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.95.
A. The Town will make hearing protectors available to all employees
exposed to an eight-hour time-weighted average of 85 decibels or
greater at no cost to the employees. Hearing protectors are replaced as
necessary. The supervisors of the affected employees will ensure that
§ 37-3 SMITHTOWN CODE § 37-7
1:46
§ 37-8. Hearing protector attenuation.
The program managers will evaluate hearing protector attenuation for the
specific noise environments in which the protector will be used. This will
be accomplished by using one of the evaluation methods as described
in Appendix B of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.95 (Methods for Estimating the
Adequacy of Hearing Protector Attenuation). The adequacy of hearing
protector attenuation will be re-evaluated whenever employee noise
exposures increase to the extent that the hearing protectors provided may
no longer provide adequate attenuation. The Town will provide more
effective hearing protectors where necessary.
§ 37-9. Training.
hearing protectors are worn by all employees who are included in the
Hearing Conservation Program and by any employee who has not yet
had a baseline audiogram.
B. Town employees are given the opportunity to select their hearing
protectors from a variety of suitable hearing protectors provided by the
Town. The Town provides training in the use and care of all hearing
protectors provided to all employees.
A. Employees who are exposed to noise at or above an eight-hour timeweighted
average of 85 decibels will receive training on the health
hazards associated with excessive noise exposure, the use of hearing
protection equipment and an explanation of their rights under OSHA 29
CFR 1910.95. A program that uses both audiovisual materials and
informational handouts has been prepared for this purpose.
Information provided in the training program will be updated to be
consistent with changes in protective equipment and work processes.
The training program includes the following elements:
(1) The detrimental health effects of excessive noise levels.
(2) The physical reasons for hearing loss.
(3) The effects of short-term and long-term exposure.
(4) Sound measuring and a description of exposure and action levels
and acceptable noise levels.
(5) The purpose of the hearing protectors, the disadvantages,
attenuation of various types and instructions on selection, fitting,
use and care.
(6) The purpose of audiometric testing, and an explanation of the test
procedures.
(7) Hearing Conservation Program recordkeeping requirements.
B. Additional training will be provided whenever a change in production,
process, equipment or controls increase noise exposures to the extent

PROCUREMENT POLICY
GENERAL REFERENCES
Best value bid awards  See Ch. 57A.
§ 57-1. Purpose.
The Procurement Policy and Procedures is developed by the Purchasing
Department and its acceptance is subject to the approval of the Town Board.
It has been crafted so as to:
§ 57-2. Statutes.
All purchases for commodities, services and public works are subject to
federal, state, county and Town laws that regulate municipal purchasing;
the fundamentals for most of these regulations are as follows:
A. Establish a system that supports objective and unbiased competition;
B. Guard against favoritism and wastefulness;
C. Ensure that the results of procurement are to the Town's benefit; and
D. Protect the best interests of the Town's residents and taxpayers.
A. New York State General Municipal Law §§ 103 and 104-b.
(1) Contained in New York State General Municipal Law Article 5A,
§§ 100 through 109-b. In particular, New York State General
Municipal Law § 103 relates to all governmental purchases of
commodities, services and technologies that are subject to the laws
of competitive procurement and are applicable for the following
monetary thresholds: commodity expenditures in excess of $20,000
and contracts for public work involving expenditures in excess of
$35,000. When using competitive bidding, contracts are awarded
to the "lowest responsible bidder" after public advertisement for
sealed bids.
(2) In January of 2012, changes were made to New York State General
Municipal Law § 103(1) which allow the Town to authorize, by local
law, the award of certain purchase contracts, including contracts
for services, subject to competitive bidding under General
Municipal Law § 103, on the basis of "best value" as defined in
§ 163 of the New York State Finance Law. The "best value" option
may be used, for example, if it is more cost efficient over time to
award the good or service to other than the lowest responsible
bidder or offeror if factors such as lower cost of maintenance,
§ 53-29 SMITHTOWN CODE § 57-2
1:84
durability, higher quality and longer product life can be
documented.11
(a) This amendment provided that purchase contracts (including
contracts for service work, but excluding any purchase
contracts necessary for the completion of a public works
contract pursuant to Article 8 of the Labor Law) shall be
awarded on the basis of best value rather than to the lowest
responsible bidder. Sections 3 through 11 amend other
subdivisions of § 103 and § 103-e of the General Municipal Law
to conform these subdivisions to allow for the awarding of
purchase contracts (including contracts for service work) on
the basis of best value.
(b) Based on these changes to GML, the Town of Smithtown's
Procurement Policy and Procedures will now allow for the use
of "best value" as a method of awarding contracts in a manner
that is in the best interest of the Town.
(c) Goods and services procured and awarded on the basis of "best
value" are those that are proven to optimize quality, cost and
efficiency, among responsive and responsible bidders/offerors.
The determination shall be based on an objective analysis of
clearly described and documented criteria as they apply to the
rating of bids or offers. Where possible, such determination
shall also be based upon and include a quantifiable analysis of
the same. The criteria may include, but shall not be limited to,
any or all of the following:
[1] Cost of maintenance;
[2] Proximity to the end user if distance or response time is a
significant term;
[3] Durability;
[4] Availability of replacement parts or maintenance
contractors;
[5] Longer product life; and
[6] Product performance criteria and quality of craftsmanship.
(d) Whenever any contract is awarded on the basis of best value
instead of lowest responsible bidder, the basis for determining
best value shall be thoroughly and accurately documented.
(3) Further amendments to General Municipal Law § 103 through the
addition of a new Subdivision (16) allow political subdivisions "to
make purchases of apparatus, materials, equipment or supplies, or
to contract for services related to the installation, maintenance or
11.Editor's Note: See Ch. 57A, Procurement: Best Value Bid Awards.
§ 57-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 57-2
1:85
repair of apparatus, materials, equipment, and supplies, . . . as may
be required by such county, political subdivision or district therein
through the use of a contract let by the United States of America
or any agency thereof, any state or any other county or political
subdivision or district therein..."
(a) It is important to note that the use of such contracts
("piggybacking") is conditioned on the contract that is to be
utilized having been "let in a manner that constitutes
competitive bidding consistent with state law, and made
available for use by other governmental entities."
(4) Local Law No. 1-2015, passed April 23, 2015, allowed for the Town
of Smithtown Purchasing Department to utilize "best value"
procurement and "piggyback" on all contracts that were let in
compliance with NYS GML statutes.
B. Federal regulations.
(1) The GSA Cooperative Purchasing Program, authorized by statute,
allows state and local governments to purchase a variety of
commercial supplies (products) and services under specific GSA
Schedule contracts to save time, money and meet their everyday
needs and missions. The Cooperative Purchasing Program gives
state and local government entities access to:
(a) Purchase information technology products and services, as
well as law enforcement, security, first responder, and marine
craft equipment, alarm and signal systems, and special
purpose clothing (GSA Schedule 70);
(b) A centralized IT and telecommunications source (GSA
Schedule 84).
(2) Provide commodities/services for law enforcement and safety and
security purposing.
(3) In addition, there are hundreds of detailed rules and regulations
regarding the process/manner of the use of federal grant funds
specific to issuing agencies and intended usages.
C. Suffolk and other counties. Suffolk County and other county contracts
are acceptable, as permissible.
D. Town of Smithtown. Upon adoption of this Procurement Policy and
Procedures, the Town Board authorizes the award of certain purchase
contracts, including contracts for services, subject to competitive
bidding under General Municipal Law § 103, on the basis of "best value"
as defined in § 163 of the New York State Finance Law. The Town law, in
addition to requiring compliance with all applicable federal, state, and
county statutes, also has laws that have been enacted solely by the
Town. They are:
§ 57-2 SMITHTOWN CODE § 57-2
1:86
(1) Apprenticeship Training Program (ATP).
(a) The Town of Smithtown requires any contractor or
subcontractor, prior to entering into a construction contract
with the Town, to have apprenticeship agreements,
appropriate for the type and scope of work to be performed,
which have been registered with and approved by the New
York Commissioner of Labor in accordance with Article 23 of
the New York Labor Law, anything in § 5103 of the New York
General Municipal Law to the contrary notwithstanding.
(b) If the amount bid for a construction contract awarded by the
Town, or the aggregate value of the individual construction
contracts on multi-prime contracts that comprise a project, is
in excess of $500,000, the contract(s) will be subject to Town
Board Resolution No. 2009-226, which requires that firms
entering into contracts with the Town for such work participate
in registered and approved apprenticeship training programs.
The contractor and his subcontractors shall provide evidence
of participation in approved apprenticeship training programs
that are appropriate for the type and scope of work to be
performed under the agreement. In addition to this policy, any
contract to be awarded by the Town shall be subject to the
requirements and conditions set forth in the bid documents.
(2) Bid submission requirement.
(a) To maintain the integrity of the bid process, the Town reserves
the right to reject any bids that are deemed incomplete,
conditional, obscure, or which contain irregularities of any
kind, including unbalanced bids. An unbalanced bid is one in
which the amount bid for one or more separate items is
substantially out of line with current market prices for the
materials and/or work covered thereby.
(b) "Tie bids" are low, responsive bids from responsible bidders
that are identical in price and which meet all the requirements
and criteria set forth in the Town's bid solicitation. As
applicable, a "tie bid" will be awarded by applying the
following tie-breaking criteria, in the order as stated:
[1] To a vendor offering the highest prompt payment discount.
[2] To a vendor with a principal place of business listed on the
bid document that is within the Township of Smithtown.
[3] To a vendor with a principal place of business listed on the
bid document that is within the County of Suffolk, New
York.
[4] To a vendor with a principal place of business listed on the
bid document that is within the State of New York.
§ 57-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 57-2
1:87
[5] The drawing of lots, if all prior criteria are the same for
included vendors.
[a] In the event that lots must be drawn to determine the
award, all tied bidders will be given the opportunity to
witness the drawing.
[b] Bidders will be given a minimum of five business days'
advanced written notice as to the place and time the
drawing will be conducted.
[c] The drawing will be conducted by the Purchasing
Department and witnessed by at least one
representative from the Town of Smithtown's Town
Clerk's office.
(c) If, during the term of the contract, the contractor and/or his/
her subcontractor is not in compliance with these regulations,
the Town may suspend the work and/or take whatever action is
deemed appropriate as defined in the bid terms and conditions.
(3) Determination of need for formal bid or quotation.
(a) Monetary thresholds.
[1] In accordance with General Municipal Law § 103,
competitive bidding is required where it is reasonably
anticipated that the aggregate amount of the goods or
services to be contracted for within one fiscal year will
exceed the monetary thresholds under General Municipal
Law § 103 ($20,000 for the purchase of commodities, or
$35,000 for public works or non-professional services as
defined below).
[2] No anticipated contract or purchase shall be divided or
structured with the intent of avoiding the requirements set
forth in the Town Procurement Policy and Procedures, and
statutory law.
[3] Prior to issuance of a purchase order pursuant to
acceptance of a competitive bid under an approved Town
of Smithtown contract (posted on the "R" drive), the
Purchasing Department must possess copies of
documentation of required insurance and contract
security or performance bond, as applicable. Purchases
should be made from vendors with existing Town of
Smithtown contracts, if a contract exists. In these
instances, blanket purchase orders are encouraged and
should be used to the extent permissible and practical.
[4] When submitting a purchase order for payment on any
purchase order originally issued in an amount exceeding
§ 57-2 SMITHTOWN CODE § 57-2
1:88
$20,000, the originating department must submit a
Contractor Performance Report (CPR) by scanning it into
KVS, before submitting the request to the Comptroller's
office. Any questions regarding this matter should be
directed to the Purchasing Department.
[5] Any purchases exceeding $750 for non-Public Works
projects (including non-professional services) or $1,499.99
for public works projects and professional services must
adhere to the following applicable procedures (under
§§ 57-4 and 57-5) and have a Town-approved purchase
order. Exceptions to this rule requiring a purchase order
are expenditures for certain bills, including, but not
limited to, insurance, performance bond reimbursements,
snow contractors, tax bills, permit refunds, travel and
mileage reimbursements, release of escrow, Medicare
reimbursements, inter-governmental and intragovernmental
purchases, petty cash reimbursements and
invoices from outside counsel. All of these may be
processed using vouchers. For convenience, blanket
purchase orders should be used for gas, fuel oil, electric,
phones, water, office supplies, equipment leases, dumpster
fees, consultants, instructors and similar expenditures
that are likely to result in an annual aggregate vendor
expenditure exceeding $1,499.99.
[6] No purchase order or contract shall be issued for an
amount that exceeds the competitive bidding thresholds
stated above prior to undertaking the formal bid process,
except for those limited circumstances set forth under this
policy and applicable law.
(b) Annual aggregate amount.
[1] Every noncontract purchase that will require a purchase
order must be initially reviewed by the Purchasing
Department to determine whether it falls into the category
of a commodities purchase or a public works procurement
request. Once that determination is reached, a good faith
effort must be extended to determine whether it is known
or can reasonably be expected that the annual aggregate
amount to be spent on the commodity or service exceeds
the competitive bidding thresholds.
[2] Annual aggregate purchases shall be evaluated to
determine cumulative dollar amounts expected within 12
months or a given expected contract term. As necessary,
user departments' anticipated requirements will be
evaluated in an attempt to determine yearly values of
commodities and/or services. In addition, past history will
also be taken into consideration in evaluating the yearly

individual purchase orders for most small transactions; however,
any such purchases can only be charged to budget codes having
adequate unencumbered balances to accommodate the purchase.

of the department head or his/her designee and will be made from
the responsive, responsible vendor offering lowest price, provided
at least one other quotation is received. Evidence of the second
quotation shall be documented in the purchasing software
(currently KVS). A Town-approved purchase order is required

holder and user department(s) indicating the revised contract
expiration date.
(5) Departments are encouraged to complete a CPR upon completion
of each contract for the purchase of goods, services, public works
and professional services regardless of intent to renew the
contract. Completed CPRs should be forwarded to the Purchasing
Department for uploading into KVS.

GML § 103 are subject to NYS GML § 104(6).
(1) General Municipal Law § 104(b) relates to all services that are
exempt from GML § 103, including, but not limited to, such
professional services that require specialized or technical skills,
expertise or knowledge; and mandates that municipalities shall
adopt internal policies and procedures to govern the procurement
of all goods and services that are not subject to the competitive
bidding requirements of General Municipal Law § 103.
(2) The Town Procurement Policy and Procedures prescribe a method
for determining whether a procurement of goods and services is
subject to competitive bidding. These procedures provide for
methods to obtain alternative proposals and quotations for goods
and services that are not subject to competitive bidding.
(3) NYS GML § 104(b) as it relates to procurement policies not covered
by GML §§ 100 through 103:
(a) Goods and services which are not required by law to be
procured by competitive bidding must be procured in a manner
so as to assure the prudent and economical use of public
moneys in the best interests of the taxpayers of the political
subdivision. To further these objectives, the governing board of
every political subdivision and any district therein, by
resolution, shall adopt internal policies and procedures
governing all procurements of goods and services which are
not required to be made pursuant to the competitive bidding
requirements of General Municipal Law § 103.
(b) Such policies and procedures shall contain provisions which,
among other things:
§ 57-6 SMITHTOWN CODE § 57-7
1:94
[1] Prescribe a procedure for determining whether a
procurement of goods and services is subject to
competitive bidding.
[2] Provide that alternative proposals or quotations for goods
and services shall be secured by use of written requests
for proposals, written quotations, verbal quotations or any
other method of procurement which furthers the purposes
of this section.
[3] Set forth when each such method of procurement will be
utilized, taking into account which method will best
further the purposes of this section and the costeffectiveness
of the method.
[4] Require adequate documentation of actions taken in
connection with each such method of procurement.
[5] Require justification and documentation of any contract
awarded to other than the lowest responsible dollar
offeror, setting forth the reasons such an award furthers
the purpose of this section.
[6] Identify the individual or individuals responsible for
purchasing and their respective titles. Such information
shall be updated biennially.
[7] Set forth any circumstances when, or types of
procurements for which, solicitation of alternative
proposals or quotations will not be in the best interest of
the political subdivision.
B. Professional services. Contracts for services that involve specialized
skill, training, knowledge, expertise, technical skill and the use of
professional judgment are considered "professional services" contracts
which are excluded from the competitive bidding requirements of
General Municipal Law § 103. Examples of professional services
include, but are not limited to, accountants, architects, attorneys,
surveyors and engineers. The procurement of such services is subject to
General Municipal Law § 104(b). The following sets forth the
procedures and requirements for the procurement of professional
services:
(1) Professional service consultants (herein "consultants") shall be
authorized pursuant to the Town Board's authorized list of
professional services consultants adopted by resolution at the Town
Board's annual organizational meeting or pursuant to a specific
Town Board resolution. It is the intent of the Town Board to develop
this authorized list through submissions received in response to a
Town-prepared request for qualifications (RFQs). This list shall be
maintained by the Purchasing Department.
§ 57-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 57-7
1:95
(2) In lieu of applicants appointed via an RFQ, the Town allows for
professional consultants to submit a professional consultant
application. After review and approval by the appropriate
department and the Director of Purchasing, the application must be
submitted to the Town Board for approval and placement on the
professional services consultants' list.
(3) Professional service requisitions (PSRs) shall be prepared by the
requesting department and approved by the department head. It
shall be further approved by the Director of Purchasing.
(a) Town Board approval shall be required for any PSR issued to
an authorized professional service consultant under the
following circumstances:
[1] For either a non-capital project or a capital project in an
amount of $25,000 or greater;
[2] If a second award is made to the same consultant for a
specified project wherein the combined total of contracts
is equal to or greater than $25,000; or
[3] An award of contract to a professional services consultant
that is not on the designated list, but has been selected for
specialized expertise; the contract resolution also will
designate the Director of Purchasing to award a PSR to the
selected consultant and the Purchasing Department will
add the consultant to the authorized consultant list.
(b) PSRs issued for a non-capital or a capital project in amounts
less than $25,000 shall require a written justification from the
requesting department. The department head of the
requesting department must state and validate that the price is
reasonable given current market conditions and that the work
is necessary. The Purchasing Department shall maintain this
documentation with the authorized PSR.
(c) Comparative pricing shall be required when a particular
project is anticipated to exceed $25,000 but is less than
$50,000 for non-capital and capital projects and the following
procedures shall be adhered to:
[1] Contact at least two firms with qualifications that match
the work that is required and obtain written price quotes;
[2] Once a firm is selected, obtain a written proposal for the
particular work to be performed and an estimated cost,
based on the number of staff hours requited to complete
the project, as well as any other additional direct out-ofpocket
costs the contractor expects to incur;
§ 57-7 SMITHTOWN CODE § 57-7
1:96
[3] Request that the Town Attorney's office prepare an
agreement for the project. Note that a separate contract
must be entered into between the Town and a selected
contractor for each project;
[4] Submit a proposed contract award to the Town Board for
approval.
(d) When there are no qualified consultants on the professional
services consultants list that possess the necessary expertise
or knowledge needed, the department head submits a written
request to the Director of Purchasing containing the following:
[1] Supporting documentation which sets forth specific and
adequate justification for selecting a particular
professional consultant;
[2] Upon the Director of Purchasing's written approval, the
worksheet resolution form to approve the PSR may be
submitted to the Town Board for approval without first
obtaining comparative pricing; and
[3] The written request of the department head shall be
included as supporting documentation to the Town Board
resolution.

proposal from contractor. Contact Purchasing for CPA form. Prepare a resolution
authorizing the Supervisor to sign agreement.
(3) Obtain at least two written proposals. Either award to the lowest-priced proposer or
prepare a written justification to award to other than the lowest proposer. Contact
Purchasing for a CPA form. Prepare a resolution authorizing the project and the
Supervisor to sign agreement.
(4) Contact Purchasing to prepare a request for proposals (RFP).
C. Emergencies. An emergency is an accident or other unforeseen
occurrence or dangerous condition that affects public buildings, public
property, life, health, safety or private property or threatens, curtails or
terminates an essential service to Town residents or the public and the
remediation cannot await competitive bidding or the solicitation of
written proposals or quotations. To meet this criteria, there must be a
present, immediate and existing condition which is creating an
imminent threat or danger.
(1) For goods and services valued between $750.01 and $2,999.99
($1,500 to $2,999.99 for P-Cards), procedures under § 57-4,
Purchase orders, (above) should be followed and a special request
made to the Director of Purchasing for expedited processing.
(2) For goods and services valued between $3,000 and $19,999.99, the
following expedited purchasing procedures will apply, provided the
department head submits, to the Purchasing Department, a written
request sufficiently detailing:
(a) The date the emergency first became known to the Town;
(b) The date, time and place the goods/services are needed;
(c) A description of how the emergency meets the definition stated
above;
(d) A list of the required goods and services, their prices and
quantities from the selected supplier;
(e) The names of any other suppliers contacted and any alternate
price quotes received;
(f) A recommended course of action;
(g) A list of any prior related emergencies.
In most cases, if the requesting department complies with
these instructions, approval for the emergency procurement
will be granted within one business day.
(3) When a Town Board Declaration of emergency is required for goods
and services valued in excess of $19,999.99, Town Board approval
must be obtained prior to issuance of a purchase order.
§ 57-7 SMITHTOWN CODE § 57-7
1:98
Departments are instructed to contact their Town Board liaison or
the Town Supervisor to commence this process as soon as possible.
D. Sole-source procurement. Sole-source procurement is one in which only
one vendor can supply the commodity, technology and/or perform the
services required, or as otherwise required by law, and there is no
substantial equivalent. In such cases, contract prices, terms and
conditions shall be determined through negotiation between the
supplier and the Town.
(1) To initiate a sole-source purchase, a solicitation review (SR) report
shall be prepared by the using department. The SR shall contain
the following elements, as applicable:
(a) Description of the goods, services or construction to be
procured;
(b) Need for the procurement;
(c) Required date of delivery for goods and services;
(d) Need to contract out (services only);
(e) Estimated cost of the proposed contract;
(f) Anticipated level of competition, including:
[1] Identification of any applicable statutory authority
mandating the purchase from a required source;
[2] Detailed explanation of why the goods, services or
construction are available from only one source of supply;
[3] Description of efforts made to explore other sources of
supply;
[4] A statement describing intended actions to develop
competition in the future;
[5] Any other facts which help support a non-competitive
award; and
[6] Cost or price analysis (as applicable) offering justification
that the proposed price is fair and reasonable.
(2) The SR report must be signed and dated by the department head.
The completed SR report should be submitted to the Purchasing
Department, along with a purchase requisition (if applicable).
(3) As this process is somewhat paper-intensive, departments are
urged to consolidate repeat sole-source purchases into
requirements contracts. Sole-source requirement contracts may
not exceed two years in duration.
§ 57-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 57-7
1:99
§ 57-8. Change orders.
(4) For sole-source purchases valued less than $20,000 ($35,000 for
public works), the Purchasing Department will send the vendor a
purchase order.
(5) For sole-source purchases in excess of $19,999.99 ($34,999.99 for
public works), the Purchasing Department will prepare a Town
Board resolution based upon the information contained in the SR
report.
E. Equipment leases. Before any commodity or equipment lease is
finalized, the lease must be forwarded to the Town Attorney for review
and approval and the Town Board shall review and approve the lease
prior to execution by the Supervisor.
F. Governmental sources. Governmental procurement sources for
commodities and service requested by the user departments shall be
investigated and utilized in accordance with applicable law, to the
extent possible. These sources may include:
(1) Federal General Services Administration (FGSA), Schedules 70 and
84;
(2) New York State Office of General Services (NYS OGS contracts);
(3) Suffolk County and other county contracts as permissible;
(4) Surplus and secondhand purchases from other governmental
entities;
(5) Commodities and/or services shall be procured from preferred
sources, pursuant to State Finance Law § 162. The Purchasing
Department shall obtain and maintain a current list of preferred
source providers from the NYS Office of General Services.
Procurements shall be in compliance with the Office of General
Services' NYS Procurement Bulletin  Preferred Source
Guidelines;
(6) National cooperative contracts as are approved and available and
in the Town of Smithtown's best interest; and
(7) Such other goods and services authorized by the Town Board in
accordance with General Municipal Law.
A. Change orders shall be authorized in the same manner as the awarded
contract. When a change order increase would result in an aggregate
change of at least the greater of 10% of the Town Board approved
contract value or $20,000, then a budget approved requisition must be
submitted to Purchasing, and approval evidenced by a Town Board
resolution is required.

PROCUREMENT: BEST VALUE BID AWARDS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Procurement Policy  See Ch. 57.
§ 57A-1. Authority and purpose.
New York General Municipal Law § 103(1) allows the Town to authorize,
by local law, the award of certain purchase contracts (including contracts
for services) subject to competitive bidding under General Municipal Law
§ 103 on the basis of "best value," as defined in § 163 of the New York State
Finance Law. The best value option may be used if, for example, it is more
cost-efficient over time to award the good or service to other than the lowest
responsible bidder or offeror, if factors such as lower cost of maintenance,
durability, higher quality and longer product life can be documented.
§ 57A-2. Applicability.
The provisions of this chapter apply to Town purchase contracts, including
contracts for services, involving an expenditure of more than $20,000,
but excluding purchase contracts necessary for the completion of a public
works contract pursuant to Article 8 of the New York Labor Law and any
other contract that may in the future be excluded under state law from the
best value option. If the dollar thresholds of New York General Municipal
Law § 103 are increased or decreased in the future by the State Legislature,
the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall be deemed simultaneously
amended to match the new General Municipal Law thresholds.
§ 57A-3. Standards for best value.
The Town Board may award purchase contracts, including contracts for
services, on the basis of "best value," as that term is defined in New York
State Finance Law § 163. Goods and services procured and awarded on
the basis of best value are those that the Town Board determines optimize
quality, cost and efficiency among responsive and responsible bidders or
offerors. Where possible, the determination shall be based on an objective
and quantifiable analysis of clearly described and documented criteria as
they apply to the rating of bids or offers. The criteria may include, but
B. A change order exceeding these minimum amounts may require
competitive bidding at the discretion of the Town Board.
C. The department requesting a change order shall document, in writing,
that the requested change order does not constitute a new undertaking
and/or alter the essential identity or main purpose of the contract for
the commodities or services provided.
§ 57-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 57A-3
1:101
shall not be limited to, any or all of the following: cost of maintenance;
proximity to the end user, if distance or response time is a significant term;
durability; availability of replacement parts or maintenance contractors;
longer product life; product performance criteria; and quality of
craftsmanship. All awards based on best value shall require Town Board
approval.
§ 57A-4. Documentation.
Whenever any contract is awarded on the basis of best value instead of
lowest responsible bidder, the basis for determining best value shall be
thoroughly and accurately documented.
§ 57A-5. Procurement Policy superseded where inconsistent.
Any inconsistent provision of the Town's Procurement Policy, as adopted
prior to the effective date of this chapter by resolution of the Town Board,
or as amended thereafter, shall be deemed superseded by the provisions of
this chapter.

the Town's disciplinary procedures and, if found guilty of such
harassment, subject to a penalty up to and including termination.

A. Authority.
(1) There shall be an Appeals Board within the Traffic Violations
Bureau which shall consist of three or more duly qualified hearing
examiners. The hearing examiner who hears and determines the
matter being appealed from shall not be a member of the particular
appeal panel as to that specific appeal, but may otherwise be a
member for other matters in which he or she did not preside and
make a determination.
(2) The Appeals Board may not consider evidence not presented to the
hearing examiner in the original hearing. The Appeals Board may
review the facts and the law in the matter appealed from on the
basis of error of fact or law. Otherwise, the Appeals Board must
affirm the determinations being appealed.
(3) Appeals may only be from final determinations after hearings made
on the record and ex parte hearings or denials of applications
(motions) to open a default judgment entered within six months.
(4) No appeal may be had where a plea of guilty or guilty with an
explanation was entered by the respondent.
B. Appeal procedure.

examiner by the plea of not guilty or a decision of a hearing
examiner denying a motion to vacate a default judgment may
obtain an appeal by filing a notice of appeal along with a filing fee
of $75 (cash, certified check or money order only). The filing fee of
$75 for the appeal includes the cost of providing the respondent
with a transcript of the proceeding that is appealed.
(2) The notice of appeal must be in writing on a form obtained from the
Traffic Violations Bureau and filed personally with the officers of
the Traffic Violations Bureau during the ordinary business hours of
said Bureau within 30 calendar days of the entry date of the final
§ 81-8 SMITHTOWN CODE § 81-10
1:124
determination(s) or decision(s). The notice of appeal may also be
filed within the same time period by mail, provided that it is mailed

determination(s) or denial of a motion to vacate a default judgment
should be reversed or modified.
(5) If the respondent wishes a transcript of the proceedings, he or she
must so indicate at the time of the filing of the notice of appeal.
Upon such request, the transcript of the proceedings will be
furnished to the respondent by mail within 30 calendar days of the
filing of the notice of appeal. If the respondent or his or her
attorney wishes to be present at the hearing on appeal, such
request to appear must be expressly noted on the notice of appeal
itself.
(6) Briefs shall not be required, but if the respondent or his or her
counsel wishes to file a brief, it must be indicated on the notice of
appeal. When the questions are presented on appeal can be
determined without an examination of all the pleadings and
proceedings, the respondent or counsel may prepare a written
statement showing how the questions arose and where decided by
the hearing examiner and set forth only so much of the facts
alleged to be proven or sought to be proven as are necessary to a
decision on the questions raised on appeal.
(7) Whether the filing is a brief or written statement, it must be filed in
triplicate with the Traffic Violations Bureau within 45 days of the
filing of the notice of appeal. The filing of a brief or statement must
be done either personally at the offices of the Parking Violations
Bureau or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,
to the offices of said Bureau.
C. Scheduling and conduct of the appeal.
(1) When the respondent has requested to appear at the appeal
hearing, the Traffic Violations Bureau shall notify the respondent
and his or her counsel of the date, time and place where the appeal
shall be held. No appeal shall be conducted fewer than 45 days
after the filing of the notice of appeal. When no request has been
made by the respondent or counsel to be present at the appeal
hearing, no other notice shall be sent to the respondent or counsel.
§ 81-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 81-10

counsel and any oral argument, if so presented.
(3) All appeals shall be submitted without oral argument unless
specifically requested in writing at the time of the filing of the
notice of appeal by the respondent or counsel.
(4) The respondent and counsel shall be notified of the decision of the
Appeals Board in writing within 60 days of the hearing date.

determination within the Traffic Violations Bureau. Judicial review
may be sought pursuant to Article 78 of the New York State Civil
Practice Laws and Rules.
(6) Failure by any respondent to furnish or supply any relevant
material required by this section within the specified time allotted
shall be deemed an abandonment of such appeal and shall
automatically be dismissed by the hearing examiners, who shall
make a notation on the notice of appeal to that effect.
D. Appeals Board determination(s).
(1) The Appeals Board shall have the authority to either dismiss the
violation(s), uphold the original determination(s) or modify the
original determination(s) by reducing fines and/or penalties.

should be dismissed, then the respondent will:

It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Town Board of the Town
of Smithtown to protect the public interest, welfare, health and safety
within the Town of Smithtown by prohibiting the consumption of alcoholic
beverages in public places within the town. The Town Board finds that
possession of open or unsealed containers of alcoholic beverages in a public
place within the town has led to consumption of the same, resulting in
public intoxication, disorderly conduct, disturbance of the public peace,
littering of the public places, destruction of property and vandalism. The
Town Board finds, further, that preservation of the public welfare and
prevention of conditions which lead to conduct disturbing the public peace
attributable to consumption of alcoholic beverages can be accomplished
by the prohibition of the consumption of alcoholic beverages in public
places and by further prohibiting the possession of an open or unsealed
container of alcoholic beverages under circumstances which indicate that
the possessor of such open or unsealed container in a public place intends
to consume the same or intends to have it consumed by another person.

of an alcoholic beverage solely for the purpose of transporting the same
without an intent or indication to consume the same in any public place.

A. Geothermal systems.
(1) Definitions.
(a) A closed loop system uses buried high-density polyethylene
(HDPE) plastic piping installed in drilled and grouted
boreholes that conductively exchanges thermal (heat) energy
with the ground via circulating water or a water/antifreeze
mixture through the piping system.
§ 112-1.3 SMITHTOWN CODE § 112-1.4
1:162
(b) An open loop system is a series of standard water wells that
extract and use groundwater directly as a heat-exchange
source then return the heated or cooled groundwater back to
the aquifer.
(c) A direct exchange system uses buried copper tubing that
conductively exchanges heat energy with the ground via
circulating a refrigerant through the tubing.
(2) There are several types of geothermal systems, also known as
"ground source heat pumps," typically used on Long Island for
space heating and cooling. They include: closed loop, open loop,
and direct exchange systems and are distinguished by the type of
ground heat exchanger (GHX) installed in the earth for heat
transfer.
(3) The closed loop and direct exchange (DX) GHXs may be installed
vertically in drilled boreholes or horizontally in excavated trenches
then backfilled. The open loop systems are installed only in vertical
drilled boreholes.
(4) When geothermal systems are proposed in conjunction with
applications for the approval of sewage disposal and water supply
facilities at a particular project site, the installation is also subject
to guidelines issued by Suffolk County Department of Health
Services (SCDHS) in General Guidance Memorandum #25,
Guidelines Regarding the Use of Geothermal Well Systems (Memo
25).
B. Permitted geothermal systems and locations.
(1) Geothermal systems may be permitted, installed, and erected
pursuant to a building permit and subject to the project meeting all
other requirements, including compliance with applicable
plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes.
(2) Permitted geothermal systems eligible to receive a building permit
are those that are of a system listed in Subsection A(1); comply
with the applicable general requirements in Subsection C; and
satisfy the following basic criteria:
(a) An open loop system using standard water well(s) to both
extract and return groundwater from/to the same aquifer and
with well screens set within 50 vertical feet of one another.
(b) An open loop system that is not connected to a potable water
system.
(c) An open loop system where the depth to groundwater is at
least 20 feet below the surface.
§ 112-1.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 112-1.4
1:163
(d) A vertical closed loop system using standard HDPE "U-bends"
installed into drilled boreholes and grouted fully from bottom
to top per industry standards.
(e) A horizontal closed loop system, using standard HDPE pipe
installed into horizontal trenches and backfilled per industry
standards.
(f) A DX-to-earth contact system including either horizontal,
diagonal or vertical loops and DX-to-water systems including
vertical loops.
(g) Is not proposed to be located within the following areas of
potential sensitivity:
[1] One-hundred-year flood hazard zones considered a V or AE
Zone on the FEMA flood maps.
[2] Tidal or freshwater wetland.
[3] Regulated tidal or freshwater surface water body.
[4] Coastal erosion hazard area.
(3) Other geothermal systems that are not eligible for a building
permit under the requirements of Subsection B(2), including those
located within areas of potential sensitivity, may be allowed at the
discretion of the Building Director after appropriate additional
review and evaluation and contingent on obtaining other required
permits or approvals from other regulatory agencies, such as the
New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
(NYSDEC) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).

§ 129-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as "Condominium and Cooperative
Conversion."
§ 129-2. Legislative intent.
A significant increase in the conversion of rental units to cooperatives
or condominiums is currently taking place. It is sound public policy to
encourage such conversion while, at the same time, protecting tenants in
possession who do not desire or who are unable to purchase the units in
which they reside from being coerced into vacating such units or paying
unconscionable rent increases. The acute shortage of housing
accommodations has aggravated the position of nonpurchasing tenants, and
the position of nonpurchasing tenants who are sixty-two (62) years of age or
older is particularly precarious because of limited financial resources and
physical limitations. The New York State Legislature, in order to provide
protection for persons sixty-two (62) years of age and older and eligible
disabled persons, has enacted Chapter 771 of the 1983 Session Laws of
New York amending § 352-e of the General Business Law by adding a new
Subdivision 2-a to cover senior citizens [persons sixty-two (62) years of age
or older] and disabled persons who are not covered under § 352-eee or
352-eeee of the General Business Law and providing for local adoption by
city, town or village governments not already covered.
§ 129-3. Adoption of provisions.
The Town of Smithtown hereby adopts the provisions of Chapter 771 of
the 1983 Session Laws of New York amending § 352-e of the General
Business Law by adding a new Subdivision 2-a to protect senior citizens
[persons sixty-two (62) years of age or older] from eviction after a plan
has been filed with the Attorney General to convert rental dwelling units
to cooperative or condominium ownership and from unconscionable rent
increases in connection with uncontrolled rental dwelling units.
§ 129-4. Enforcement; penalties for offenses; injunction.
A. For purposes of confirming jurisdiction upon courts and judicial
officers, any violation of this chapter shall be deemed to be a
misdemeanor, and, as such, all provisions of law relating to
misdemeanors shall apply herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any

The purpose of this article is to implement the State Environmental Quality
Review Act, the town's Local Waterfront Revitalization Program and its
consistency review regulations and procedures for the Town of Smithtown,
thereby incorporating environmental and social factors and the
consideration of coastal resources into existing planning and
decisionmaking processes.
§ 151-6. Applicability.
All boards, departments, officers, other bodies or officers of the Town of
Smithtown must comply with the State Environmental Quality Review Act,
and its regulations as they are amended from time to time, and the Town
of Smithtown Environmental Quality and Coastal Consistency Review Law
of this Article to the extent applicable, prior to carrying out, approving or
funding any action other than an exempt or excluded action, as those terms
are defined in Part 617 of the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules and
Regulations of the State of New York (NYCRR), or a Type II Action, as that
term is defined in this Article.
§ 151-7. Definitions.
As used in this Article, the following terms shall have the meanings

1:241
§ 151-10. Environmental and coastal assessment forms.
A. When any agency contemplates directly carrying out, funding or
approving any Type I or unlisted action, an environmental assessment
form (EAF) must be prepared by the applicant or on the applicant's
behalf.

more than one involved agency, as that term is used in 6 NYCRR
Part 617, and the Town Board is one of those agencies,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary found in this article.
D. The Board of Appeals will be the lead agency for the determination of
environmental significance for those actions which are within its scope
of authority as defined and found in Chapter 322 of the Town Code.
E. The Planning Board will be lead agency for the determination of
environmental significance for those actions which are within its scope
of authority as defined and found in Chapter 248 of the Town Code.

617. This determination must be based on the EAF, the
recommendation of the Supervisor of Environment and Waterways and
on such other information as the lead agency may require. The criteria
listed in 6 NYCRR Part 617 must be considered by the lead agency in
making its determination of significance. The determination must be
made within 20 calendar days of the date of lead agency designation or
within 20 calendar days of its receipt of all information required by the
lead agency to make its determination, whichever is later. No
determination of significance shall be made until such time as the Town
Board determines the consistency of an action located in the coastal
area pursuant to § 151-15 of this article.
B. If the lead agency makes a determination that there will be no adverse
environmental effect or that identified environmental effects will not be
significant, it shall make a negative declaration and proceed in
accordance with the requirements of 6 NYCRR Part 617.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 153-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as "Chapter 153, Stormwater Management and
Erosion and Sediment Control, of the Code of the Town of Smithtown."
§ 153-2. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined by the Town Board of the Town of Smithtown that:
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition.
B. Stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne
pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species.
C. Clearing and grading during construction tend to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat.
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation.
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow.
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the Town.
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities.
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
§ 153-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 153-3
1:263
§ 153-3. Statutory authority.
In accordance with § 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law of the State
of New York, the Town Board has the authority to enact local laws and
amend local laws for the purpose of promoting the health, safety or general
welfare of the Town of Smithtown and for the protection and enhancement
of its physical environment. The Town Board may include in any such local
law provisions for the appointment of any municipal officer, employees, or
independent contractor to effectuate, administer and enforce such local
law. This chapter is adopted pursuant to the requirements of Section 402
of the Clean Water Act (CWA), which deemed stormwater discharges from
certain construction activities unlawful unless they are authorized by a
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit or by a
state permit program. New York's State Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System is a NPDES-approved program with permits issued pursuant to
Article 17, Titles 7, 8, and Article 70 of the Environmental Conservation Law
(ECL).
§ 153-4. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the Town of
Smithtown and to address the findings of fact in § 153-1. This chapter seeks
to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives:
A. Meet the minimum construction site stormwater runoff control and
post-construction stormwater management requirements of the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation State Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System General Permit for Stormwater
Discharges from Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s),
Permit Number GP-02-02 or as amended or revised.
B. Require land development activities that will discharge stormwater to
the waters of the Town to conform to the substantive requirements of
the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation State
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System General Permit for
Construction Activities, Permit Number GP-02-01 or as amended or
revised.
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels.
D. Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land
development activities, which would otherwise degrade local water
quality.

surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to
support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil
conditions, commonly known as "hydrophytic vegetation."
LAND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY(IES)  Construction activity including
clearing, demolition, grading, excavating, stockpiling, soil disturbance or
placement of fill that results in land disturbance of equal to or greater
than one acre, or activities disturbing less than one acre of total land
area that is part of a larger common plan of development or sale that will
ultimately disturb one or more acres of land, even though multiple separate
and distinct land development activities may take place at different times
on different schedules, or activities disturbing less than one acre of total
land area where the Town has determined there is a potential for significant
contribution of pollutants to surface waters of the Town.
LANDOWNER (OR OWNER)  The person in whom is vested the
ownership, dominion, title or control of property, including but not limited to
the landowner's duly authorized agent, proprietor, mortgagee or vendee in
possession, assignee of rents, tenant or lessee, purchaser, devisee, fiduciary
and any other person having a vested interest in the property in question.
LARGER COMMON PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT OR SALE  A contiguous
area where multiple separate and distinct construction activities are
occurring, or will occur, under one plan. The term "plan" in "larger common
plan of development or sale" is broadly defined as any announcement or
piece of documentation (including a sign, public notice or hearing, sales
pitch, advertisement, drawing, permit application, State Environmental
Quality Review Act application, zoning request, computer design, etc.) or
physical demarcation (including SPDES General Permit for Stormwater
Discharge from MS4s, GP-0-08-002 boundary signs, lot stakes, surveyor
markings, etc.) indicating that construction activities may occur on a
specific plot. For discrete construction projects that are located within a
larger common plan of development or sale that are at least 1/4 mile apart,
each project can be treated as a separate plan of development or sale,
§ 153-5 SMITHTOWN CODE § 153-5

provided any interconnecting road, pipeline or utility project that is part of
the same "common plan" is not concurrently being disturbed.
LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT  A site design strategy with a goal of
maintaining or replicating the predevelopment hydrologic regime through
the use of design techniques to create a functionally equivalent hydrologic
landscape. Hydrologic functions of storage, infiltration, and groundwater
recharge, as well as the volume and frequency of discharges, are
maintained through the use of integrated and distributed microscale
stormwater retention and detention areas, reduction of impervious
surfaces, and the lengthening of flow paths and runoff time. Other
strategies include the preservation/protection of environmentally sensitive
site features such as riparian buffers, wetlands, steep slopes, valuable
(mature) trees, floodplains, woodlands and highly permeable soils. Lowimpact
development principles are based on controlling stormwater at the
source by the use of microscale controls that are distributed throughout
the site. This is unlike conventional approaches that typically convey and
manage runoff in large facilities located at the base of drainage areas.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 164-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Fire Prevention Code
of the Town of Smithtown."
§ 164-2. Authority.
This chapter is adopted under the authority of the Municipal Home Rule
Law and the Executive Law (Article 18) of the State of New York.
§ 164-3. Purpose.
A. The present level of loss of life, injury to persons and damage to
property as a result of fire demonstrates that the people of the Town of
Smithtown and their guests are in a need to receive the basic level of
protection to which they are entitled, due to the unique circumstances
presented in the Town of Smithtown in connection with the
construction and maintenance of buildings.
B. New York State, with its size and vast differences in characteristics
among its counties, cities, towns and villages, duly enacted the New
York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code to provide a
basic minimum level of safety standards. This code was adopted to
provide at least some form of uniformity throughout the state. However,
Smithtown, due to its population and size, as well as its unique
characteristics, warrants a more stringent Fire Prevention Code.
C. Occupying approximately 140 square miles, Smithtown has a daytime
population exceeding a quarter of a million people. As host to one of the
largest industrial parks in the United States, Smithtown attracts many
industries, employing over 100,000 individuals in over 600 businesses
and industries. Among them are high tech, manufacturing, chemical,
biological and hazardous materials enterprises. Many of these
enterprises develop, as products or wastes, hazardous, toxic or
radioactive materials or wastes which are found to be in a solid, liquid
or gaseous state.
D. Many of Smithtown's access roads were built to handle vehicles
designed in the 1930's and 1940's, and much of the Town's road system
is narrow and difficult to traverse. Today's vehicles, especially
commercial and emergency equipment apparatus, are much larger and
more cumbersome. Combined with the tremendous volume of traffic
that the roads of Smithtown handle everyday, these unique
circumstances diminish the response time for emergency service
equipment and personnel.
E. The Town of Smithtown has densely populated areas, and often times,
commercial, industrial, retail and residential uses converge in a
§ 164-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 164-3
1:301
§ 164-4. Applicability.
relatively small area. Smithtown, while providing unique advantages
to its population, is in need of unique and more stringent safety
requirements and standards in order to ensure that the unique
characteristics that Smithtown has to offer may continue to exist in a
safe and healthy atmosphere.
F. Therefore, it is the expressed intent of the Town Board of the Town of
Smithtown to provide for the enactment of this chapter in order to
provide a basic minimum level of protection to all people of the Town of
Smithtown from hazards of fire, explosion and inadequate road and
building construction.
G. It is further the intent of the Town Board to enact this chapter as an
expression of its desire to prescribe standards consistent with
nationally recognized practices for the safeguarding, to a reasonable
degree, of life and property.
H. Now, therefore, the Town Board of the Town of Smithtown hereby
enacts this chapter to provide for the protection of life and property.
A. The provisions of this chapter shall apply equally to new and existing
conditions and structures, except that existing conditions and
structures not in strict compliance with the terms of this chapter shall
be permitted to continue where the existing condition or structure does
not constitute an imminent and distinct hazard to life or property in the
opinion of the Fire Prevention Division. In the event that the Fire
Prevention Division shall determine an existing condition to be an
imminent and distinct hazard to life or property, then the Fire
Prevention Division may order immediate corrective actions to be
undertaken. [Amended 3-14-2000 by L.L. No. 4-2000]
(1) If, after the effective date of this chapter, a building or structure is
not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the Fire
Prevention Division has determined that the building, structure or
condition does not present an imminent and distinct hazard to life
or property, then that condition, building or structure may continue
to exist as is.
(2) If, after the effective date of this chapter, a building or structure not
in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be altered,
modified, changed, constructed, enlarged or otherwise adapted,
modified, repaired, restored or changed to an extent exceeding
50% of the fair market value of such building or structure, then the
entire building or structure shall be constructed and used in full
compliance with the provisions of this chapter and all other
applicable laws, rules and regulations.
B. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as applying to the
transportation of any article or thing shipped under the jurisdiction of

Statutory Authorization and Purpose
§ 168-1. Findings.
The Town Board of the Town of Smithtown finds that the potential and/
or actual damages from flooding and erosion may be a problem to the
residents of the Town of Smithtown and that such damages may include:
destruction or loss of private and public housing, damage to public facilities,
both publicly and privately owned, and injury to and loss of human life. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter is adopted.
§ 168-2. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
§ 168-3. Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are:
A. Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due
to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
D. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damages;

Definitions
§ 168-4. Terms defined.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common
usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
APPEAL  A request for a review of the local administrator's interpretation
of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF MODERATE WAVE ACTION  The portion of the SFHA landward
of a V Zone or landward of an open coast without mapped V Zones, in which
the principal sources of flooding are astronomical tides, storm surges,
seiches, or tsunamis, not riverine sources. Areas of moderate wave action
may be subject to wave effects, velocity flows, erosion, scour, or
combinations of these forces and are treated as V Zones. The area of
moderate wave action is an area within a Zone AE that is bounded by a line
labeled "Limit of Moderate Wave Action."
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO, AH or VO Zone on
a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percent or
greater annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of one foot to
three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path
of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain within
a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. This area may be designated as Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-A30,
A99, V, VO, VE, or V1-V30. It is also commonly referred to as the "base
floodplain" or "one-hundred-year floodplain." For purposes of this chapter,
the term "special flood hazard area (SFHA)" is synonymous in meaning with
the phrase "area of special flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  That portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL  A wall that is not part of the structural support of
the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse
under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated
portion of the building or the supporting foundation system.
BUILDING  See "structure."
CELLAR  Has the same meaning as "basement."
COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREA  An area of special flood hazard
extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along
an open coast and any other area subject to high-velocity wave action from
storms or seismic sources. The area is designated on a FIRM as Zone
§ 168-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-4
1:403
V1-V30, VE, VO or V. The coastal high hazard area shall also include areas
on a FIRM within a Zone AE that are bounded by a line labeled "Limit of
Moderate Wave Action."
CRAWL SPACE  An enclosed area beneath the lowest elevated floor, 18
inches or more in height, which is used to service the underside of the
lowest elevated floor. The elevation of the floor of this enclosed area, which
may be of soil, gravel, concrete or other material, must be equal to or above
the lowest adjacent exterior grade. The enclosed crawl space area shall be
properly vented to allow for the equalization of hydrostatic forces which
would be experienced during periods of flooding.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING  A non-basement building (i) built, in the case of a
building in Zone A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or D, to have the top
of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zone V1-V30, VE, or V, or
area of moderate wave action, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structure member of the elevated floor, elevated above the ground level
by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to
the flow of the water and (ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the
structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of
the base flood. In the case of Zone A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X,
or D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill
or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zone V1-V30, VE, or V,
"elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition
of "elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means of
breakaway walls that meet the federal standards.
FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY  The federal agency
that administers the National Flood Insurance Program.
FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM)  An official map of the
community published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as
part of a riverine community's Flood Insurance Study. The FBFM delineates
a regulatory floodway along watercourses studied in detail in the Flood
Insurance Study.
FLOOD EVALUATION STUDY  An examination, evaluation and
determination of the flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water
surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of
flood-related erosion hazards.
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM)  An official map of a
community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where
the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been designated as
Zone A but no flood elevations are provided.

of permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home)
on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, installation of pilings
or construction of columns. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation (such as clearing, excavation, grading, or filling), or the
installation of streets or walkways, or excavation for a basement, footings,
piers or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms, or the installation
of accessory buildings such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling

engineer or architect, and shall be accompanied by a statement,
bearing the signature of the architect or engineer, certifying that the
design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice and with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 168-13, Application for permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of Article V, Construction Standards, and, in
particular, § 168-22B, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
Article V, Construction Standards, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
A. When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated
areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation data

§ 168-16. Alteration of watercourses.
The local administrator shall:
§ 168-17. Construction stage.
(these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor identified
a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state or other source, including data developed pursuant to
§ 168-13G, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial
improvements or other proposed development meet the requirements
of this chapter.
B. When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other authoritative
source, such as historical data, to establish flood elevations within the
areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes of this chapter.
A. Notify to adjacent communities and the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submittal of evidence of such
notification to the Regional Director, Region II, Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
B. Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance within
the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the floodcarrying
capacity is not diminished.
A. In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood elevation
data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or completion of
floodproofing of a new or substantially improved structure, the local
administrator shall obtain from the permit holder a certification of the
as-built elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, in

lowest horizontal structural member supporting the lowest elevated
floor (excluding columns, piles, diagonal bracing attached to the piles
or columns, grade beams, pile caps and other members designed to
either withstand storm action or break away without imparting
damaging loads to the structure) is elevated to or above two feet above
base flood elevation so as not to impede the flow of water.
§ 168-23 SMITHTOWN CODE § 168-25
1:420
B. Determination of loading forces. Structural design shall consider the
effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously during the base
flood on all building components.
(1) The structural design shall be adequate to resist water forces that
would occur during the base flood. Horizontal water loads
considered shall include inertial and drag forces of waves, current
drag forces, and impact forces from waterborne storm debris.
Dynamic uplift loads shall also be considered if bulkheads, walls, or
other natural or man-made flow obstructions could cause wave
runup beyond the elevation of the base flood.
(2) Buildings shall be designed and constructed to resist the forces due
to wind pressure. Wind forces on the superstructure include
windward and leeward forces on vertical walls, uplift on the roof,
internal forces when openings allow wind to enter the house, and
upward force on the underside of the house when it is exposed. In
the design, the wind should be assumed to blow potentially from
any lateral direction relative to the house.
(3) Wind loading values used shall be those required by the building
code.
C. Foundation standards.
(1) The pilings or column foundation and structure attached thereto
shall be adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement due to the effects of wind and water pressures acting
simultaneously on all building components. Foundations must be
designed to transfer safely to the underlying soil all loads due to
wind, water, dead load, live load and other loads (including uplift
due to wind and water).
(2) Spread footings and fill material shall not be used for structural
support of a new building or substantial improvement of an existing
structure.
D. Pile foundation design.
(1) The design ratio of pile spacing to pile diameter shall not be less
than 8:1 for individual piles (this shall not apply to pile clusters
located below the design grade). The maximum center-to-center
spacing of wood piles shall not be more than 12 feet on center
under load-bearing sills, beams, or girders.
(2) Pilings shall have adequate soil penetration (bearing capacity) to
resist the combined wave and wind loads (lateral and uplift)
associated with the base flood acting simultaneously with typical
structure (live and dead) loads, and shall include consideration of
decreased resistance capacity caused by erosion of soil strata
surrounding the piles. The minimum penetration for foundation
piles is to an elevation of five feet below mean sea level (msl) datum
§ 168-25 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-25
1:421
if the BFE is +10 msl or less, or to be at least 10 feet below msl if
the BFE is greater than +10 msl.
(3) Pile foundation analysis shall also include consideration of piles in
column action from the bottom of the structure to the stable soil
elevation of the site. Pilings may be horizontally or diagonally
braced to withstand wind and water forces.
(4) The minimum acceptable sizes for timber piles are a tip diameter of
eight inches for round timber piles and eight inches by eight inches
for square timber piles. All wood piles must be treated in
accordance with requirements of EPEE-C3 to minimize decay and
damage from fungus.
(5) Reinforced concrete piles shall be cast of concrete having a twentyeight-
day ultimate compressive strength of not less than 5,000
pounds per square inch, and shall be reinforced with a minimum of
four longitudinal steel bars having a combined area of not less than
1% nor more than 4% of the gross concrete area. Reinforcing for
precast piles shall have a concrete cover of not less than 1 1/4
inches for No. 5 bars and smaller and not less than 1 1/2 inches for
No. 6 through No. 11 bars. Reinforcement for piles cast in the field
shall have a concrete cover of not less than two inches.
(6) Piles shall be driven by means of a pile driver or drop hammer,
jetted, or augered into place.
(7) Additional support for piles in the form of bracing may include
lateral or diagonal bracing between piles.
(8) When necessary, piles shall be braced at the ground line in both
directions by a wood timber grade beam or a reinforced concrete
grade beam. These at-grade supports should be securely attached
to the piles to provide support even if scoured from beneath.
(9) Diagonal bracing between piles, consisting of two-inch by eightinch
(minimum) members bolted to the piles, shall be limited in
location to below the lowest supporting structural member and
above the stable soil elevation, and aligned in the vertical plane
along pile rows perpendicular to the shoreline. Galvanized steel
rods (minimum diameter 1/2 inch) or cable-type bracing is
permitted in any plane.
(10) Knee braces, which stiffen both the upper portion of a pile and the
beam-to-pile connection, may be used along pile rows
perpendicular and parallel to the shoreline. Knee braces shall be
two-by-eight lumber bolted to the sides of the pile/beam, or four-byfour
or larger braces framed into the pile/beam. Bolting shall
consist of two five-eighths-inch galvanized steel bolts (each end) for
two-by-eight members, or one five-eighths-inch lag bolt (each end)
for square members. Knee braces shall not extend more than three
feet below the elevation of the base flood.

reinforced to resist vertical and lateral loads, and be connected
with a movement-resisting connection to a pile cap or pile shaft.
F. Connectors and fasteners.
(1) Galvanized metal connectors, wood connectors, or bolts of size and
number adequate for the calculated loads must be used to connect
adjoining components of a structure. Toe nailing as a principal
method of connection is not permitted. All metal connectors and
fasteners used in exposed locations shall be steel, hot-dipped
galvanized after fabrication. Connectors in protected interior
locations shall be fabricated from galvanized sheet.
G. Beam-to-pile connections.
(1) The primary floor beams or girders shall span the supports in the
direction parallel to the flow of potential floodwater and wave
action and shall be fastened to the columns or pilings by bolting,
with or without cover plates. Concrete members shall be connected
by reinforcement, if cast in place, or (of precast) shall be securely
connected by bolting and welding. If sills, beams, or girders are
attached to wood piling at a notch, a minimum of two five-eighthsinch
galvanized steel bolts or two hot-dipped galvanized straps 3/
16 inch by four inches by 18 inches each bolted with two one-halfinch
lag bolts per beam member shall be used. Notching of pile tops
shall be the minimum sufficient to provide ledge support for beam
members without unduly weakening pile connections. Piling shall
not be notched so that the cross-section is reduced below 50%.
H. Floor and deck connections.
(1) Wood two-by four-inch (minimum) connectors or metal joist
anchors shall be used to tie floor joists to floor beams/girders.
These should be installed on alternate floor joists, at a minimum.
Cross-bridging of all floor joists shall be provided. Such crossbridging
may be one-by three-inch members, placed eight feet oncenter
maximum, or solid bridging of same depth as joist at same
spacing.
(2) Plywood should be used for subflooring and attic flooring to provide
good torsional resistance in the horizontal plane of the structure.
The plywood should not be less than 3/4 inch total thickness, and
should be exterior grade and fastened to beams or joists with 8d
annular or spiral thread galvanized nails. Such fastening shall be
supplemented by the application of waterproof industrial adhesive
applied to all bearing surfaces.
I. Exterior wall connections.
§ 168-25 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-25
1:423
(1) All bottom plates shall have any required breaks under a wall stud
or an anchor bolt. Approved anchors will be used to secure rafters
or joists and top and bottom plates to studs in exterior and bearing
walls to form a continuous tie. Continuous 15/32-inch or thicker
plywood sheathing, overlapping the top wall plate and continuing
down to the sill, beam, or girder, may be used to provide the
continuous tie. If the sheets of plywood are not vertically
continuous, then two-by-four nailer blocking shall be provided at all
horizontal joints. In lieu of the plywood, galvanized steel rods of
one-half-inch diameter or galvanized steel straps not less than one
inch wide by 1/16 inch thick may be used to connect from the top
wall plate to the sill, beam, or girder. Washers with a minimum
diameter of three inches shall be used at each end of the one-halfinch
round rods. These anchors shall be installed no more than two
feet from each corner rod, no more than four feet on center.
J. Ceiling joist/rafter connections.
(1) All ceiling joists or rafters shall be installed in such a manner that
the joists provide a continuous tie across the rafters. Ceiling joists
and rafters shall be securely fastened at their intersections. A
metal or wood connector shall be used at alternate ceiling joist/
rafter connections to the wall top plate.
(2) Gable roofs shall be additionally stabilized by installing two-by-four
blocking on two-foot centers between the rafters at each gable end.
Blocking shall be installed a minimum of eight feet toward the
house interior from each gable end.

detailed, and constructed to withstand loads due to the design wind
speed of 75 miles per hour. Connections for these elements must be
designed to transfer safely the design loads to the supporting
structure. Panel widths of multiple-panel sliding glass doors shall
not exceed three feet.
N. Breakaway wall design standards.
(1) The breakaway wall shall have a design-safe loading resistance of
not less than 10 and not more than 20 pounds per square foot, with
the criterion that the safety of the overall structure at the point of
wall failure be confirmed using established procedures. Grade
beams shall be installed in both directions for all piles considered
to carry the breakaway wall load. Knee braces are required for
front row piles that support breakaway walls.
(2) Use of breakaway wall strengths in excess of 20 pounds per square
foot shall not be permitted unless a registered professional
engineer or architect has developed or reviewed the structural
design and specifications for the building foundation and
breakaway wall components, and certifies that the breakaway walls
will fail under water loads less than those that would occur during
the base flood; and the elevated portion of the building and
supporting foundation system will not be subject to collapse,
displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind
and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components

§ 168-29. Appeals Board; considerations; records.
A. The Board of Zoning Appeals as established by the Town of Smithtown
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
B. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the local administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals may
appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals, shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search and rescue operations during periods of
flooding;
§ 168-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-29
1:429
§ 168-30. Conditions for variances.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations,
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of § 168-29D and the purposes of this
chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood elevation, providing items (1) through
(12), inclusive, in § 168-29D have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure; and
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E, and F of this section are met;
and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
§ 168-29 SMITHTOWN CODE § 168-30
1:430
§ 168-31. When effective.
This chapter shall take effect immediately upon its filing in the Office of the
Secretary of State of the State of New York.
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
lowest floor elevation.

Wetlands Regulation
[Adopted 9-7-1976 as L.L. No. 4-1976]
§ 170-3. Short title.
This Article shall be known as the "Freshwater Wetlands Protection Law of
the Town of Smithtown."
§ 170-4. Declaration of policy.
It is declared to be the public policy of the Town of Smithtown to preserve,
protect and conserve freshwater wetlands and the benefits derived
therefrom, to prevent the despoliation and destruction of freshwater
wetlands and to regulate the development of such wetlands in order to
secure the natural benefits of freshwater wetlands, consistent with the
general welfare and beneficial economic, social and agricultural
development of the town. It is further declared to be the policy of the Town
of Smithtown to exercise its authority pursuant to Article 24 of the State
Environmental Conservation Law.
§ 170-5. Statement of findings.
A. The freshwater wetlands located in the Town of Smithtown are
invaluable resources for flood protection, wildlife habitat, open space
and water resources.
B. Considerable acreage of freshwater wetlands in the town has been lost,
despoiled or impaired by unregulated draining, dredging, filling,
excavating, building, pollution or other acts inconsistent with the
natural uses of such areas. Other freshwater wetlands are in jeopardy
of being lost, despoiled or impaired by such unregulated acts.
C. Recurrent flooding aggravated or caused by the loss of freshwater
wetlands has serious effects upon natural ecosystems.
D. Freshwater wetland conservation is a matter of concern.
E. Any loss of freshwater wetlands deprives the people of the Town of
Smithtown of some or all of the many and multiple benefits to be
derived from wetlands, for example:
(1) Flood and storm control by the hydrologic absorption and storage
capacity of freshwater wetlands.
(2) Wildlife habitat by providing breeding, nesting and feeding
grounds and cover for many forms of wildlife, wildfowl and
shorebirds, including migratory wildfowl and rare species.
(3) Protection of subsurface water resources and provision for
valuable watersheds and recharging groundwater supplies.

1:521
§ 185-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Historic Districts Law
of the Town of Smithtown."
§ 185-2. Purpose.
A. The Smithtown Town Board finds that the historic heritage of
Smithtown is among its most valued and most important educational,
cultural and economic assets. It is the intent of the Town Board to
promote the conservation, protection and preservation of historic sites
and structures within Smithtown for the education, welfare and
pleasure of the residents of Smithtown.
B. The Town Board of Smithtown therefore finds that:
(1) There exist in sections of the Town of Smithtown pieces of property,
archaeological sites, landmarks and buildings of:
(a) Special historic interest, by reason of association with historic
or famous events or by reason of antiquity or by reason of
association with historic or famed personages or by reason of
being illustrative of events or periods in the history and growth
of the Town of Smithtown.
(b) Unusual aesthetic interest or value, by reason of being
representative of a style or period of architecture or by reason
of extraordinary architectural merit or by reason of association
with other buildings, landmarks, pieces of property or
archaeological sites that are historically and/or architecturally
valuable.
(2) In some sections of Smithtown, these archaeological sites, pieces of
property, buildings and landmarks actually form a distinct area or
district of two or more archaeological sites, pieces of property,
buildings and landmarks that may or may not be contiguous. These
districts also deserve special consideration and delineation as
districts because of the reasons listed herein.
(3) The conservation, protection, rehabilitation and perpetuation of
such archaeological sites, parcels of property, buildings, landmarks
and districts is a public necessity for the good of the community
and will promote the education, civic pride, economic well-being
and general welfare of the residents of Smithtown.
C. Now, therefore, the Town Board declares that the purpose of this
chapter is to encourage and to accomplish the conservation, protection,
rehabilitation and perpetuation of such archaeological sites, pieces of
property, buildings, landmarks and districts in the Town of Smithtown.

progressive deterioration, certain structures, properties and lots have
the effect of creating blighting conditions and initiating slums,

property values thereby maintained, neighborhood characteristics,
amenities and aesthetics may be enhanced and improved and the

uses may be enhanced and the public health, safety and welfare

§ 242-1. Legislative intent.
A. The Town Board of the Town of Smithtown, Suffolk County, New York,
finds herewith that personal wireless communications services and
personal wireless service facilities comprise a rapidly growing segment
of the utilities and communications sector and have merit and value for
the community as a whole. The United States Congress adopted the
Telecommunica-tions Act of 1996, including Section 704 which defines
personal wireless service and personal wireless service facilities and
preserves local zoning authority over decisions regarding the
placement, construction and modification of personal wireless service
facilities except for five limitations, to wit:
(1) A local government shall not unreasonably discriminate among
providers of functionally equivalent services.
(2) A local government shall not prohibit or have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.
(3) A local government shall act on any requests for authorization to
place, construct or modify personal wireless service facilities
within a reasonable period of time after the request is filed.
(4) A local government shall put any decision to deny a personal
wireless service facility into writing and support such decision by
substantial evidence contained in a written record.
(5) A local government shall not regulate personal wireless service
facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio
frequency emission to the extent that such facilities comply with
the Federal Communications Commission Guidelines for Evaluating
the Environmental Effects of Radiofrequency Radiation (FCC
Guidelines).
§ 233-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 242-1

§ 242-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
B. The Town of Smithtown is authorized to adopt laws to provide for the
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Town of Smithtown, and
the regulation of the placement, installation and construction of
personal wireless service facilities preserves and protects the health,
safety, welfare and general well-being of the citizens of the Town of
Smithtown. The Town of Smithtown Planning Department and the Town
of Smithtown Town Board have, during the period of a current
moratorium, undertaken a deliberative process to establish policy,
standards and procedures related to the location, siting and design of
mounts and antenna arrays for personal wireless services; and the
Town of Smithtown Town Board has conducted workshops during the
current moratorium on deployment of wireless communications and has
found that alternatives to towers exist for the purpose of deploying
personal wireless service facilities.
C. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to establish standards for the
location, siting and design of personal wireless service facilities, and
the goals of this chapter are to:
(1) Allow for alternative types of personal wireless service facilities in
any location subject to standards.
(2) Encourage the use of existing structures, including, but not limited
to, rooftops, utility poles and steeples, for deploying personal
wireless service facilities.
(3) Expedite the review process for those applications choosing the
least intrusive alternative of deploying personal wireless service
facilities.
(4) Encourage users of guyed and lattice towers, monopoles and
antennas to locate, site and design them in a way that minimizes
the adverse visual impact of the lattice or guyed towers, monopoles
and antennas.
(5) Enhance the ability of the providers of personal wireless services to
provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and
efficiently.
(6) Promote personal wireless service facilities compatible with

A. Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to
establish standards for the location, siting and design of PWSF's, and
the goals of this chapter are to:
(1) Allow for alternative types of PWSF's in any location subject to
standards.
(2) Encourage the use of existing structures, including but not limited
to rooftops, utility poles and church steeples, for deploying PWSF's.
(3) Expedite the review process for those applications choosing the
least intrusive alternative of deploying PWSF's.
(4) Encourage users of guyed and lattice towers, monopoles and
antennas to locate, site and design them in a way that minimizes
the adverse visual impact of the lattice or guyed towers, monopoles
and antennas.
(5) Enhance the ability of the providers of personal wireless services to
provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and
efficiently.
(6) Promote PWSFs' compatibility with surrounding land uses, and
protect the attractiveness, health, safety, general welfare and
property values of the community.
B. Preexisting personal wireless service facilities.
(1) Permits and renewals.
(a) A PWSF for which a building permit has been issued prior to
the effective date of this chapter shall be deemed a permitted
use, subject to the conditions of that permit. When an
unpermitted PWSF is identified by the Town of Smithtown to
be attached to a mount approved for another use or PWSF, a
separate permit must be applied for it, even when:
[1] Sharing a legal mount;
[2] Already in operation, and
[3] Duly licensed by the Federal Communications
Commission.
(b) The issuance of permit renewals or other new permits for such
facilities shall be in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. Unpermitted PWSF's will be considered out of
compliance with this chapter.
(2) Placement of any attached array, microcell or any other portions of
a PWSF on an existing structure, whether legally nonconforming or
in, as well as out of, compliance, shall require a permit to be
obtained for the PWSF under the terms of this chapter.
§ 242-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 242-3
1:599
§ 242-4. Specification of land use classifications.
(3) Any carrier with at least one preexisting PWSF in the Town of
Smithtown that is out of compliance with the Town of Smithtown
building or zoning requirements shall not be eligible for any new
approvals of personal wireless service facilities by the Town until
the preexisting PWSF or PWSF's are brought into compliance with
this chapter.
C. Exclusions for amateur radio facilities. This chapter shall not govern
the installation of any amateur radio facility that is owned and operated
by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator or is used
exclusively for noncommercial, receive-only antennas.
D. Unpermitted facilities, mounts or equipment ineligible for collocation.
(1) No permit shall be issued under this chapter for a request to
collocate, attach or share an existing PWSF site, mount or facility
when such existing site, mount or facility is found to have one or
more PWSF's without permits and/or any structure, mount or
facility is found to lack one or more building permits, electrical
permits or any other permits required by the Town of Smithtown.
(2) Any application by a wireless carrier or other entity shall not be
approved by the Town of Smithtown if that wireless carrier has a
preexisting PWSF on, or the other entity owns, a mount, rooftop or
tower, on which there is any unpermitted PWSF until that PWSF is
brought into compliance with this chapter.
E. Relationship to other laws. This chapter shall supersede conflicting
requirements contained in the Town of Smithtown Building Zone
Ordinance57 regarding the siting and permitting of PWSF's.
A. No PWSF shall be permitted except in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter and § 322-8 of the Building Zone Ordinance.

Superintendent of Highways. The base lift shall be three inches of a
binder course (Type 3) Standard Specification of the State of New
York and a two-inch lift of (Type 7) Standard Specification of the
State of New York. This course shall be rolled with an eight- or tenton
roller, and surface variations in excess of 1/4 inch shall be
eliminated or the pavement relaid.
(3) At the discretion of the Superintendent of Highways, if the
temporary patching is not accomplished, final pavement replacing
must be completed within 20 days of opening. If temporary
patching is accomplished as specified, then final pavement
replacing must be completed within 30 days of temporary patching
or within such additional time as may be authorized by the
Highway Superintendent, at his discretion, upon application.

Superintendent of Highways, a release will be provided to the
applicant.

Utility Poles on Town Road Rights-of-Way
[Adopted 7-14-2015 by L.L. No. 2-2015]
§ 245-35. Legislative intent.
This Town Board hereby finds and determines that public utility companies
place poles on Town of Smithtown roads and rights-of-way to facilitate the
delivery of electric, telephone, and cable television services to the residents
of the Town of Smithtown. This Board also finds that utility poles are
frequently damaged by traffic accidents and adverse weather conditions.
This Town Board determines that public safety can be compromised when
utility lines and equipment remain affixed to weathered/damaged/old poles
for unreasonably long periods of time. This Town further determines that
a utility's delay in removing lines and equipment also delays the removal
of the pole itself, which causes a proliferation of aesthetically unpleasant
"double woods" or "double poles" along roadways. This Town Board also
finds and determines that local governments have the authority to regulate
their roads and rights-of-way to protect the public. Therefore, the purpose
of this article is to require utilities that use Town roads and rights-of-way to
promptly remove their plants, cables, lines, equipment and terminals from
old and damaged poles and to further require the prompt removal of double
poles once all plants, cables, lines, terminals and other fixtures have been
removed.
§ 245-36. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
DANGEROUS/DAMAGED POLE  Any utility pole that is structurally
compromised due to weather, a traffic incident, and/or age, and poses a
potential threat to public safety.
DEPARTMENT  The Town of Smithtown Highway Department.
DOUBLE POLE  Any damaged utility pole or old utility pole from which
the plant has been removed, in whole or in part, which is attached or in
close proximity to a new utility pole.
PLANT  The cables, terminals, conductors, and other fixtures necessary
for transmitting electric, telephone, cable television or other
telecommunications service.
PUBLIC UTILITY  Any corporation, authority or other entity that provides
electric, telephone, cable television, or other telecommunications service to

ARTICLE VI
Performance Bond and Cash Deposit
[Amended 7-12-1966]
§ 248-17. Purpose.
A performance bond and cash deposit are posted by the subdivider to
guarantee to the Town that he will faithfully construct or cause to be
constructed the required public improvements and utilities which were an
integral part of his approved final plat and, further, that the construction
shall be completed within a reasonable period of time.
§ 248-18. Procedure.
A. A performance bond estimate, on a form developed by the Town
Engineer, will be prepared by the Town Engineer and by the Director of
the Traffic Safety Department for street signs, streetlights, traffic
signals, pavement markings and such other related traffic control
devices. [Amended 6-10-1975; 11-24-1981; 3-13-2007]
B. The Planning Board will pass a resolution either approving or adjusting
the performance bond estimate and shall provide three copies signed
by the Chairman for the use of the subdivider in obtaining and posting a
bond.
C. The subdivider shall present a performance bond executed on the
standard performance bond, Form F-609, three copies, with signed
copies of the performance bond estimate attached, to the Town
Attorney, at least one week prior to any Town Board meeting, for
approval as to form and sufficiency by the Town Board at such meeting.
A certified check in the amount of the cash deposit and payable to the
Town of Smithtown shall be submitted to the Planning Department. The
amount of the certified check shall be determined as follows: $500 per
building lot. The performance bond is to be in the same amount as the
performance bond estimate, less the amount of the certified check as
stated aforesaid. [Amended 12-22-1981; 1-25-1983; 3-13-2007]
D. The Town Attorney shall notify the Town Clerk prior to the Town Board
meeting that the performance bond and cash deposit can be added to
the agenda.
E. The Town Board shall approve or disapprove the performance bond and
cash deposit as presented by the Town Attorney. If approved, the cash
deposit is to be forwarded to the Town Comptroller, to be deposited in a
Town of Smithtown trust account set up for this purpose, and one copy
of the performance bond is to be forwarded to the Town Clerk for his
records, and one copy will be forwarded, along with the Town Board
resolution of approval, to the Planning Board.
§ 248-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 248-18
1:667
F. The Chairman of the Planning Board shall receive the Town Board
resolution approving the performance bond and cash deposit prior to
signing any final plat.
G. After completing the construction of the public improvements covered
by the performance bond and cash deposit and prior to the termination
of the bond and cash deposit period, the subdivider shall prepare a set
of the approved public improvement plans, drainage plans and profiles
(lithoprints on vellum), amended to indicate as-constructed
information, and forward it to the Town Engineer. Further, the
developer shall forward to the Town Attorney an original and two copies
of papers dedicating the public improvements, granting of easements,
etc., [§ 248-13A(9)] for his subdivision. Upon the Town Attorney's
approval of the form of the dedication papers and easements, the Town
Engineer and the Town Highway Superintendent shall, within 90 days
after such approval, jointly prepare a report to the Town Board, with a
copy of it to the Planning Board, on the condition of the work and
recommend whether the performance bond and cash deposit shall be
released or not. If winter weather conditions prohibited the inspection
and the written report, the ninety-day period may be extended for an
additional 60 days by the Town Board. When, in the Town Engineer's
and Town Highway Superintendent's opinion, an extension of the bond
is warranted, they shall make a recommendation to that effect to the
Planning Board, with a copy thereof to the Town Board. [Amended
4-23-1968]
H. Completion of public improvements; cost. [Amended 4-23-1968]
(1) In the event that the public improvements covered by the
performance bond and cash deposit have not been constructed to
the satisfaction of the Town Engineer and Town Highway
Superintendent, they shall forward, within 30 days of the
inspection, a written report jointly signed by representatives of
their departments to the subdivider, giving him a period of six
months or less within which time he has to complete said public
improvements to their satisfaction. If, upon the expiration of this
period, the public improvements have still not been completed to
the satisfaction of said Town Engineer and Town Highway
Superintendent, or additional items are uncovered which are
incomplete, a second written report will be sent to the subdivider
wherein he will be given 45 days or less to complete the
enumerated items. If, at the expiration of the second period, the
public improvements still have not been completed to the
satisfaction of the Town Engineer and Town Highway
Superintendent as stated aforesaid, then the Town Board may
declare the performance bond and cash deposit in default.
(2) If the cost of completing the public improvements is less than that
of the cash deposit, the Town Board may utilize the moneys
deposited by the subdivider in the Town of Smithtown trust account
set up for this purpose. At the Town Board's discretion, the actual

§ 248-20. Growth and life maintenance bond. [Amended 8-8-1972]
work completing the public improvements may be performed by

bid. Should the cost of completion be less than that of the cash
deposit, then the remaining balance is to be returned to the
subdivider upon the Town Board's final acceptance of dedication of
the public improvements in the subdivision and the release of the
performance bond.
(3) In the event that the cost of completion of the public improvements
is equal to or in excess of that of the cash deposit, the Town Board
may utilize the moneys deposited in the trust account set up for this
purpose, as well as declare the performance bond in default.
Further, should plans and specifications be required to ascertain
the cost of placing the completion of the public improvements out
for bid, the cost of preparing said plans and specifications may be
made out of the cash deposit.
I. The Planning Board can act to extend the term of the performance bond
and cash deposit in appropriate cases where such action would not be
contrary to the intent of this regulation.
J. The Town Board shall act on the release of, on the effectuation of
Subsection H above or on the declaration of default of the performance
bond and cash deposit, provided that neither of the latter two
eventualities are brought into effect prior to the expiration date, or any
extension thereof, of said performance bond and cash deposit.
A. The cash deposit shall run concurrently with the performance bond,
and neither can be released without a Town Board resolution to this
effect.
B. Performance bonds and cash deposits shall have a minimum term of two
years.
C. Upon petition to the Planning Board and after a duly advertised public
hearing upon said petition, said Board may consider the extension of
the performance period of a performance bond upon the petitioner's
proof of necessity or unusual or extenuating circumstances. [Amended
6-13-1967]
D. Each petition shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $500 along with
whatever supporting papers, documents, maps or other material may
be needed to support the petition. [Added 6-13-1967; amended
11-24-1981; 1-10-1989; 7-9-1991; 12-11-2018]
A. Prior to the release of a performance bond and related cash deposit, the
subdivider shall offer the Town a growth and life bond and/or cash
§ 248-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 248-20
1:669
deposit to guarantee the life and growth of all street tree plantings and
recharge basin plantings installed within the subdivision section.
B. The amount of the growth and life bond and/or cash deposit shall be
determined by the Engineering Department. Amounts up to $1,500
shall be presented to the Town in the form of cash or certified check, for
deposit into an escrow account bearing the name of the filed map.
Where the amount of the growth-and-life bond and/or cash deposit
exceeds $1,500, the first $1,000 shall be in the form of cash or certified
check for deposit in the aforementioned escrow account, and the
balance may be offered either as part of the required cash deposit or
certified check or as a growth-and-life bond in a form which is
acceptable to the Town Attorney.
C. The term of the cash deposit and/or growth and life bond shall be a
minimum of 10 months and shall bear the expiration date of October 31
of the year following the year in which the cash deposit and/or growth
and life bond are posted.
D. The Engineering Department shall conduct an inspection 30 to 60 days
prior to the expiration date of the growth and life bond and/or cash
deposit. In the event that any of the street tree recharge basin plantings
covered by the growth and life bond and/or cash deposit require
replacement, the Engineering Department shall forward a report to the
developer. The subdivider shall have 45 days from the expiration date of
the growth and life bond and/or cash deposit to replace all dead or
missing plantings required by the report. If, at the expiration of the
forty-five-day planting period, the plantings have still not been
satisfactorily completed, the Town Board shall declare the growth and
life bond and/or cash deposit to be in default.
E. If the cost of completing the required plantings is equal to or less than
the amount of the cash deposit, the Town Board may utilize the moneys
deposited by the subdivider in the Town of Smithtown trust account set
up for this purpose to obtain the necessary replacements. At the Town
Board's discretion, the actual work of completing the street tree and/or
recharge basin plantings may be performed by one of the Town's
departments or by an outside contractor selected by public bid. Should
the cost of completion be less than the cash deposit, then the remaining
balance is to be returned to the subdivider upon the Town Board's final
acceptance of the required plantings. The growth and life bond, if any,
will also be released.
F. In the event that the cost of completion of the required plantings is in
excess of the cash deposit, the Town Board may utilize the moneys
deposited in the trust account set up for this purpose to obtain the
necessary replacements, as well as declare the growth and life bond in
default. Further, should plans and specifications be required in order to
put the work out to public bid, the cost of preparing said plans and
specifications will be charged to the cash deposit.
§ 248-20 SMITHTOWN CODE § 248-20
1:670
G. The Town Board can act to extend the term of the growth and life bond
and/or cash deposit in appropriate cases where such action would not
be contrary to the intent of this regulation.
H. The Town Board shall act on the release of, on the effectuation of
Subsections D, E and F above, or on the declaration of default of, the
growth and life bond and/or cash deposit, provided that neither of the
latter two eventualities are brought into effect prior to the expiration
date or any extension thereof of said growth and life bond and/or cash
deposit.
I. A cash deposit shall run concurrently with the growth and life bond, and
neither can be released without a Town Board resolution to that effect.
J. Where required by the Superintendent of Highways or the Town
Engineer, the subdivider shall provide a maintenance bond to
guarantee the cleanliness, for a period of one year, of the recharge
basin required to be installed by the original performance bond
estimate. This bond shall be presented prior to the release of the
performance bond and cash deposit.

such as recharge basins, schools, firehouses and churches.
E. Natural areas, parks and playgrounds are vital to a well-balanced
community. Each subdivision plat will be required to show an area of at
least two acres per 100 building lots for such purposes. In cases where
the Planning Board determines that a suitable park of adequate size
cannot be properly located in any such plat or is otherwise not
practical, the subdivider will be required to pay a cash equivalent. Such
payment shall be a condition precedent to the filing of the subdivision
plat and shall be deposited to the account of the Smithtown Park Fund
and shall be used for park, playground or other recreational purposes,
including the acquisition of property. The location of parkland
purchased with these funds shall be in accordance with a
Comprehensive Plan for Town parks. The dollar amount of the required
cash equivalent shall be determined by multiplying the number of lots
in the subdivision plat by the average value of land per acre at that
location, as established by the Town Assessor, and dividing by 50.
[Amended 3-26-2002; 4-27-2004; 5-22-2014]
A. The street and highway layout shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan
for streets and highways.
B. Parcels and lots of a subdivision shall back on primary and secondary
highways. Further, a limited access and planting area shall be provided

additional hazards. Limited access and planting areas shall have the
following characteristics:
(1) They shall be 15 feet wide and provide additional area in lots where
they are required.
(2) The deed easement shall prohibit the construction of any building
on this area and also prohibit ingress or egress from the lot or
parcel over the easement area.
(3) They shall be provided with appropriate fencing and planting
according to Town specifications.
C. The street pattern within a subdivision shall be orderly. Where
appropriate, a major street shall be indicated for more direct access to
minor streets.
D. Subdivisions abutting Long Island state parkways or state parks shall
be designed so that parcels or lots face these areas and a marginal
access street is provided along the boundary line.
E. Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use for through traffic will
be discouraged. Particular attention should be given to eliminating
possible bypasses around traffic signals and major intersections.
F. Block dimensions.
(1) The maximum length shall be 1,200 feet. The minimum length shall
be 400 feet.
(2) The minimum width shall relate to the zoning district requirements
for yards and generally shall provide for two tiers of lots.
(3) Special attention shall be given to blocks in industrial and business
zones to provide for access to the lots and areas for parking and
truck delivery.
G. Culs-de-sac.
(1) The maximum length shall be 500 feet. The minimum length shall
be 200 feet. The length shall be measured on the center line of the

§ 248-26. Preservation of natural environment.
§ 248-27. Property near railroads.
Where the property to be subdivided is next to or includes a railroad rightof-
way, suitable provisions shall be made for such things as road crossings,
screening and freight access in recognition of the relationship between the
railroad and the subdivision.
§ 248-28. Regrading.
(3) The center line of all streets entering an intersection shall pass
through a single point.
(4) Intersections of minor and major streets shall be spaced a
minimum of 150 feet apart, measured from the points of
intersection of the center lines.
(5) Intersections on a highway shall be spaced a minimum of 800 feet
apart, measured from the points of intersection of the center lines.
A. Subdivision designs shall preserve, insofar as is possible, the natural
terrain and natural drainage lines.
B. A conscious effort shall be made to preserve all worthwhile trees and
shrubs which exist on a site. Such features may well be suggested for

as said term is defined in An Ordinance to Regulate and Control General
Regrading of Land, Extraction and Removal of Earth Products and
Other Excavations, as adopted by and amended by the Town Board of
the Town of Smithtown.73
B. It is the policy of the Town of Smithtown to discourage massive
regrading of subdivision sites where such earthmoving would cause
extreme cut or fill for streets or house locations, the stripping of natural
ground cover and the destruction of worthwhile topographic features.
C. To this end, subdivision layouts should be designed to fit existing
natural conditions of the site insofar as such designs are consistent with
73.Editor's Note: See Ch. 154, Excavations and Grading.
§ 248-25 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 248-28

Variance of Zoning Requirements
§ 248-30. Authority.
The Planning Board was authorized to vary the Building Zone Ordinance76
requirements by Town Board resolution on June 22, 1954.
§ 248-31. Authorized powers.
A. The Planning Board is authorized to make any reasonable change in the
building zone regulations which apply to the land platted in order to
permit desirable flexibility in subdivision plat planning consistent with
the general character of the community and the general welfare,
provided that:
(1) Planning Board approval shall be simultaneous with final plat
approval and after public hearing preceded by the same public
notice required for the approval of the plat itself.
(2) There is no change in permitted or special exception uses.
(3) The resulting average population density and land coverage shall
not be greater than was permitted in the zone districts shown on
the Zoning Map.
(4) Any change in the building zone regulations by the Planning Board
shall be made in accordance with the conditions and standards
enumerated under § 322-30.4 of the Town Code. [Added
9-11-2007]
B. Criteria for review and approval of residential subdivision plats by the
Planning Board pursuant to the provisions of § 278 of the Town Law of
New York State. [Added 7-12-1983; amended 7-17-2018]
(1) Findings.
(a) The Town of Smithtown has grown into a mature suburban
Town. There is relatively little vacant land left for new
residential subdivision development. Much of this land has
remained undeveloped until now because of certain sitespecific
obstacles to construction, e.g., steep slopes or lowlying
wetlands. However, the increasing demand for new
housing, coupled with favorable market conditions, has made
these remaining properties more attractive for development.
(b) The Town Planning Board recognizes that these properties
should be developed according to sound planning, engineering
and environmental principles. More specifically, they should be
developed with the following goals in mind:
76.Editor's Note: See Ch. 322, Zoning.
§ 248-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 248-31
1:681
[1] To preserve open space and, subsequently, to provide
opportunities for passive or active recreational uses.
[2] To design environmentally compatible layout and
construction so as to prevent the destruction of or
minimize the adverse impacts to significant natural
resources such as natural landforms, steep slopes,
groundwater, floodplains, tidal and freshwater wetlands,
ponds, streams, prime agricultural soils, vegetation,
wildlife, scenic corridors and vistas, clean air and solar or
wind energy sources.
[3] To reduce the long-term municipal maintenance costs that
must be borne by the Town.
[4] To preserve and enhance the character of established
neighborhoods.
[5] To prevent or minimize adverse impacts to or the
destruction of significant cultural resources such as
historic sites and structures and archaeological sites.
(c) The preservation and protection of these and other natural and
cultural resources will benefit the general health, safety and
welfare of the present and future residents of the Town.
Clustering of residential development is a proven means of
protecting natural and cultural resources. When the physical
nature of the land or its location within the community is such
that a standard subdivision does not attain these goals or
would be inappropriate, whether for environmental or safety
reasons, then a cluster design shall be required.
(d) In addition to these benefits, good cluster design helps reduce
street construction and maintenance costs, reduce vehicular
trip miles, conserve fuel and other energy and minimize school
tax burdens. Good cluster design can also help preserve the
established character of an area, enhance social interaction
within the community, strengthen community identity and,
finally, provide the variety of living environments necessary to
meet the needs and desires of the Town.
(2) Criteria for review and approval.
(a) A proposed residential subdivision shall be clustered if it will
impact on any of the following natural resources or
phenomena:
[1] Slopes exceeding 15%, areas with erosion problems and
areas where the mass movement of soil can occur, e.g.,
escarpments.
[2] (Reserved)
§ 248-31 SMITHTOWN CODE § 248-31
1:682
[3] (Reserved)
[4] Flood hazard areas, including natural drainage swales and
flood zones, as defined by the National Flood Insurance
Program.
[5] Shallow depth to groundwater (less than 20 feet).
[6] Surface water resources such as bays, estuaries, lakes,
ponds and streams, whether continuous or intermittent.
[7] Saltwater and freshwater wetlands.
[8] Land within the coastal zone, as defined by the New York
State Department of State.
[9] Woodlands having a median trunk diamter of more than 12
inches and an area of more than three acres.
[10] Habitat for rare, unique, threatened, endangered or
protected species of plants and animals, such as bogs, pine
barrens and ecotones.
[11] Significant local topographic phenomena such as
kettleholes, kames and high points; also, scenic views and
corridors.
[12] Land adjacent to state or county lands, state parkways,
state and county highways, railroads, large Town parks
and the Nissequogue River Greenbelt.
[13] Known or suspected archaeological sites.
[14] Historic resources listed in the Historic Sites Inventory of
the Town of Smithtown.
(b) (Reserved)
C. Local Waterfront Revitalization Program (LWRP). [Added 7-25-1989]
(1) Findings.
(a) No subdivision, including those which have not yet received
preliminary approval as of the effective date of this provision,
shall be approved until the Town Board has determined,
pursuant to Chapter 151, Article II, of the Town Code, that the
subdivision is consistent with the LWRP policies, standards and
conditions or until the Town Board determines with respect to
the proposed action that:
[1] No reasonable alternatives exist which would permit the
action to be undertaken in a manner which will not
substantially hinder the achievement of such LWRP
policies, standards and conditions.
§ 248-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 248-31
1:683
[2] The action would be undertaken in a manner which will
minimize all adverse effects on such LWRP policies,
standards and conditions to the maximum extent
practicable.
[3] The action will advance one or more of the other LWRP
policies, standards and conditions.
[4] The action will result in an overriding Town, regional or
statewide public benefit.
(b) Such a finding shall constitute a determination that the action
is consistent with the LWRP policy standards and conditions.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter of the Town
Code, all subdivisions within the Local Waterfront Area shall
conform to the following requirements: [Amended 4-5-1990]
(a) All subdivisions shall be clustered pursuant to § 281 of the
Town Law of the State of New York such that:
[1] The combined areas of clearing of the existing vegetation
and regrading shall not exceed a total of 25% of the plat
area. All limits of clearing shall be shown on the final map,
and restrictive covenants shall be filed on all portions of
the property plat area which constitutes the 75% of said
area to remain undisturbed.
[2] The subdivision conforms to the LWRP's adopted land use
plan.
[3] After determining the yield of a property pursuant to
§ 322-19, all environmentally sensitive lands of two or
more contiguous acres shall be preserved and protected
from disturbance by deed covenants to run with the land,
prohibiting the construction or placement of buildings
and/or accessory structures, the removal of existing
vegetation, the alteration of topography, the disturbance of
existing soils, the removal or placement of soils or fill and/
or the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides.
Subject to the approval of the Planning Board and the
Town Board, such environmentally sensitive lands may be
dedicated to the Town of Smithtown.
[4] All scenic vistas and historic elements shall be preserved
and protected through the use of suitable permanent
easements or deed covenants to run with the land.
(b) The open space shall be adjacent to existing or proposed
conservation, recreation and/or agricultural uses as shown on
the LWRP proposed land use plan.

§ 248-32. Variance resolution; fee. [Amended 1-10-1989; 7-9-1991;
2-22-1999; 6-2-2015]
A description of variances granted shall become part of the Planning Board
resolution approving each final plat. A fee of $500 for each variance request
per lot shall be required except for variances necessary for open space
subdivisions.
(c) Development rights may be transferred to land outside the
coastal area as authorized by the Town Code.
(d) The Planning Board shall modify to the maximum extent
practical the requirements of §§ 248-25D, F and G, 248-28D, E
and F, 248-35A(1), (2), (4) and (5), and 248-37A(1) and B (Table

Drainage System
§ 248-38. Grading and drainage system plan.
§ 248-39. Design standards.
A. A preliminary grading and drainage system plan shall be a part of the
preliminary layout. It shall indicate in general terms a proposal for an
adequate system of drainage structures to carry off and store or
discharge the stormwater runoff and natural drainage water which
originates not only within the property boundaries, but also that which
originates beyond the property boundaries.
B. The public improvement and utilities plan and profiles shall show the
final drainage plan and street profiles. They shall be prepared and
submitted with the final plat after the approval of the preliminary layout
and drainage plan. (See § 248-16, Public improvement plan and
profiles, of these subdivision regulations of the Town of Smithtown.)
C. No stormwater runoff or natural drainage water shall be so diverted as
to overload existing drainage systems or create flooding or the need for
additional drainage structures on other private properties or public
lands, without proper and approved provisions being made for taking
care of these conditions.
A. Collection system.
(1) The collection system shall be designed in accordance with the
rational method of design using the following formula:
Q = AiR
Where
Q = The required capacity in cubic feet per second for the
collection system at the point of design.
A = The tributary drainage area in acres, and shall
include areas tributary from outside sources as well
as from within the subdivision itself.
i = The coefficient of runoff applicable to the drainage
area, and shall be based on consideration of the soil
conditions, the average slope of the drainage area
and the degree of ultimate development of the area,
but in no case shall be less than the following
coefficients:
Type of Development Coefficient
Undeveloped land 0.10
2-acre lot, residential development 0.15
§ 248-38 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 248-39
1:697
Type of Development Coefficient
1-acre lot, residential development 0.17
1/2-acre lot, residential
development
0.20
10,000-square-foot lot, residential
development
0.32
Business area 0.90
R = The rainfall intensity in inches per hour, and shall be
determined by the following formula:
Where
t = The time of concentration in minutes at the
point of design.
(2) Pipes or conduits shall be designed using Manning's formula for
velocity:
Where
R = The hydraulic radius of the conduit flowing full.
n = The coefficient of friction (n = 0.015 for pipes 18
inches or smaller in diameter; n = 0.013 for pipes
over 18 inches in diameter or for concrete culverts).
s = The slope of the pipe in feet per foot; "s" shall
generally be considered as being the same as the
slope of the invert of the pipe; however, such slope
shall be checked against the available hydraulic
gradient wherever the system discharges into a
stormwater recharge basin, pond or other body of
water.
(3) Wherever possible, design velocities in pipes shall be three feet per
second or over. Where steep grades are encountered, velocities
over 15 feet per second shall be avoided by the use of drop
manholes in the line.
§ 248-39 SMITHTOWN CODE § 248-39
1:698
(4) Manholes shall be provided in drain lines not more than 350 feet
apart and wherever branches are connected or sizes are changed
and wherever there is a change in alignment or grade.
(5) The alignment of pipes shall be in a straight line between
manholes.
(6) Drain lines shall be placed between the center line of the road and
the curbline and shall, as far as practical, parallel the center line of
the road.
(7) Not more than two catch basins shall be interconnected before
being connected to a manhole.
B. Stormwater recharge basins. Stormwater recharge basins shall be
provided wherever there is no available outlet for stormwater or where
the available outlets are inadequate, provided that test pits indicate
that the earth materials encountered have desirable seepage qualities.
(1) Recharge basins shall provide a storage capacity for five inches'
rainfall on the tributary area where suitable means for overflow are
provided.
(2) Recharge basins without suitable means for overflow shall provide
storage capacity for an eight-inch rainfall on the tributary area.
(3) The coefficient of runoff for recharge basin design shall be based
on the soil characteristics and average slope of the drainage area,
but in no case shall the coefficient be less than 0.30.
C. Brooks or ditches. Where brooks or ditches are used as outlets, they
shall be designed by the use of Manning's formula as indicated for
collection systems in Subsection A(2) above, with the following
considerations:
(1) The friction factor shall be:
(a) For earth ditches: 0.025.
(b) For paved ditches: 0.013.
(2) Slopes for ditch banks shall not be steeper than one on two.
(3) Design velocities in earth ditches shall not exceed three feet per
second.
(4) A ditch or brook right-of-way of sufficient minimum width to
include a ten-foot access strip, in addition to the width of the ditch
or brook from bank top to bank top, shall be offered for dedication
to the Town for drainage purposes. Such right-of-way shall be
shown on the drainage plan and on the final plan.

B. Any exemption provided by this section shall be computed after all
partial exemptions allowed by law have been substituted from the total
amount assessed.
C. The real property tax exemption or real property owned by husband and
wife, one of whom is 65 years of age or over, once granted, shall not be
rescinded solely because of the death of the older spouse, so long as the
surviving spouse is at least 62 years of age.

built as a cooperative apartment and owned by such cooperative
apartment corporation determined by the relationship of such real
property vested in such tenant-stockholder to such entire parcel and

corporation in which such tenant-stockholder resides shall be subject to
exemption from taxation pursuant to this section, and any exemption so
granted shall be credited against the assessed valuation of such real
property; the reduction in real property taxes realized thereby shall be

[Added 12-12-1995 by L.L. No. 5-1995]
§ 256-1 SMITHTOWN CODE § 256-3
1:716
A. No exemptions shall be granted if the income of the owner or the
combined income of the owners of the property for the income tax year
immediately preceding the date of making application for exemption
exceeds the maximum income as may be provided by § 256-1A of this
article. "Income tax year" shall mean the twelve-month period for which
the owner or owners filed a federal personal income tax return or, if no
such return is filed, the calendar year. Where title is vested in either the
husband or the wife, their combined income may not exceed such sum.
Such income shall include social security and retirement benefits,
interest dividends, total gain from the sale or exchange of a capital
asset which may be offset by a loss from the sale of or exchange of a
capital asset in the same income tax year, net rental income, salary or
earnings and net income from self-employment but shall not include a
return of capital, gifts or inheritances, or moneys earned through
employment in the federal foster grandparent program, and any such
income shall be offset by all medical and prescription drug expenses
actually paid which were not reimbursed or paid for by insurance. The
provisions of this subsection notwithstanding, such income shall not
include veterans disability compensation as defined in Title 38 of the
United States Code. In computing net rental income and net income
from self-employment, no depreciation deduction shall be allowed for
the exhaustion or wear and tear of real or personal property held for the
production of income. [Last amended 2-22-2007 by L.L. No.
2-2007]
B. No exemption shall be granted unless the title of the property shall have
been vested in the owner or one of the owners of the property for at
least 24 consecutive months prior to the date of making application for
exemption; provided, however, that in the event of the death of either a
husband or wife in whose name title of the property shall have been
vested at the time of death and which then becomes vested solely in the
survivor by virtue of devise by or descent from the deceased husband or
wife, the time of ownership of the property by the deceased husband or
wife shall be deemed also a time of ownership by the survivor, and such
ownership shall be deemed continuous for the purposes of computing
such period of 24 consecutive months. In the event of a transfer by
either a husband or wife to the other spouse of all or part of the title to
the property, the time of ownership of the property by the transferor
spouse shall be deemed also a time of ownership by the transferee
spouse, and such ownership shall be deemed continuous for the
purposes of computing such period of 24 consecutive months. Where
property of the owner or owners has been acquired to replace property
formerly owned by such owner or owners and taken by eminent domain
or other involuntary proceeding, except a tax sale, the period of
ownership of the former property shall be combined with the period of
ownership of the property for which application is made for exemption,
and such periods of ownership shall be deemed to be consecutive for
purposes of this section. Where a residence is sold and replaced with
another within one year and both residences are within the state, the
period of ownership of both properties shall be deemed consecutive for
§ 256-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 256-3
1:717
§ 256-4. Application for exemption. [Amended 2-25-1997 by L.L. No.
1-1997]
purposes of the exemption from taxation by a municipality within the
state granting such exemption. Where the owner or owners transfer
title to property which, as of the date of transfer, was exempt from
taxation under the provisions of this section, the reacquisition of title
by such owner or owners within nine months of the date of transfer
shall be deemed to satisfy the requirement of this subsection that the
title of the property shall have been vested in the owner or one of
the owners for such period of 24 consecutive months. Where, upon
or subsequent to the death of an owner or owners, title to property
which, as of the date of such death, was exempt from taxation under
such provisions becomes vested, by virtue of devise or descent from the
deceased owner or owners or by transfer by any other means within
nine months after such death, solely in a person or persons who, at the
time of such death, maintained such property as a primary residence,
the requirement of this subsection that the title of the property shall
have been vested in the owner or one of the owners for such period of
24 consecutive months shall be deemed satisfied.
C. No exemption shall be granted unless the property is used exclusively
for residential purposes; provided, however, that in the event that any
portion of such property is not so used exclusively for residential
purposes but is used for other purposes, such portion shall be subject to
taxation and the remaining portion only shall be entitled to the
exemption provided by this section.
D. No exemption shall be granted unless the real property is the legal
residence of and is occupied in whole or in part by the owner or by all of
the owners of the property, provided that an owner who is absent while
receiving health-related care as an inpatient of a residential health care
facility, as defined in § 2801 of the Public Health Law, shall be deemed
to remain a legal resident and an occupant of the property while so
confined, and income accruing to that person shall be income only to
the extent that it exceeds the amount paid by such owner, spouse or coowner
for care in the facility and provided, further, that during such
confinement such property is not occupied by other than the spouse or
co-owner of such owner.
A. Application for such exemption must be made by the owner or all of the
owners of the property on forms prescribed by the State Board, to be
furnished by the appropriate assessing authority, and shall furnish the
information and be executed in the manner required or prescribed in
such forms and shall be filed in such Assessor's office on or before the
taxable status date (March 1). Any person otherwise qualifying under
this section shall not be denied the exemption under this section if he
becomes 65 years of age after the appropriate taxable status date and
before December 31 of the same year.
§ 256-3 SMITHTOWN CODE § 256-4
1:718
§ 256-5. Renewal.
B. In the event that the owner or all of the owners of the property fail to
file the application required on or before taxable status day (March 1),
such owners may file the application, executed as if such application
had been filed on or before the taxable status day (March 1) with the
Assessor on or before the date for hearing of complaints (the third
Tuesday in May), where failure to file a timely application resulted
from: (a) a death of the applicant's spouse, child, parent, brother or
sister; or (b) an illness of the applicant or of the applicant's spouse,
child, parent, brother or sister, which actually prevents the applicant
from filing on a timely basis, as certified by a licensed physician. The
assessor shall approve or deny such application as if it had been filed on
or before the taxable status date. [Added 11-3-2015 by L.L. No.
5-2015]
C. In the event the owner, or all of the owners, of property which has
received an exemption pursuant to this section on the preceding
assessment roll fail to file the application required pursuant to this
section on or before the taxable status date such owner or owners may
file the application, executed as if such application had been filed on or
before the taxable status date, with the assessor on or before the date
for the hearing of complaints. [Added 11-3-2015 by L.L. No. 5-2015]
A. At least 60 days prior to the appropriate taxable status date, the
assessing authority shall mail to each person who was granted
exemption pursuant to this section on the latest completed assessment
roll an application form and a notice that such application must be filed
on or before the taxable status date and be approved in order for the
exemption to be granted. The assessing authority shall, within three
days of the completion and filing of the tentative assessment roll, notify
by mail any applicant who has included with his application at least one
self-addressed, prepaid envelope of the approval or denial of the
application; provided, however, that the assessing authority shall, upon
the receipt and filing of the application, send by mail notification of
receipt to any applicant who has included two of such envelopes with
the application. Where an applicant is entitled to a notice of denial
pursuant to this section, such notice shall be on a form prescribed by
the State Board and shall state the reasons for such denial and shall
further state that the applicant may have such determination reviewed
in the manner provided by law. Failure to mail any such application
form or notices or the failure of such person to receive any of the same
shall not prevent the levy, collection and enforcement of the payments
of the taxes on property owned by such person.
B. In the event that the owner or all of the owners of the property which
has received an exemption pursuant to this chapter on the preceding
assessment roll fail to file the application required on or before taxable
status day (March 1), such owners may file the application, executed as
if such application had been filed on or before the taxable status day
§ 256-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 256-5
1:719
§ 256-6. Penalties for offenses.
Any conviction of having made any willful false statement in the application
for such exemption shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $100
and shall disqualify the applicant or applicants from further exemption for
a period of five years.
(March 1) with the Assessor on or before the date for hearing of
complaints (the third Tuesday in May). [Amended 12-25-1992 by L.L.
No. 2-1992]
C. Any person who has been granted an exemption pursuant to this section
on five consecutive completed assessment rolls shall not be subject to
the requirements set forth in Subsection A of this section. However,
said person shall be mailed an application form and a notice informing
him of his rights. Such exemption shall be automatically granted on
each subsequent assessment roll; provided, however, that when tax
payment is made by such person, a sworn affidavit must be included
with such payment, which shall state that such person continues to be
eligible for such exemption. Such affidavit shall be on a form prescribed
by the State Board. If such affidavit is not included with the tax
payment, the collecting officer shall proceed pursuant to § 551-a of the
Real Property Tax Law.

levied, on the appropriate tax roll used for the fiscal year or years
during which the transfer occurred times the previously granted
exempt amount times the fraction of each fiscal year or years remaining

Law § 485-b, Subdivision 7. All definitions, terms and conditions of such

A. Real property constructed, altered, installed or improved subsequent to
the effective date of this article for the purpose of commercial, business
or industrial activity shall be eligible for partial exemption from
taxation and special ad valorem levies for the increase in assessed value
attributable thereto to the extent provided in § 485-b of the Real
Property Tax Law of the State of New York, and as hereinafter provided.
For purposes of this article the terms "construction," "alteration,"
"installation," and "improvement" shall not include ordinary
maintenance and repairs.
B. In any year in which a change in level of assessment of 15% or more is
certified for a final assessment roll pursuant to the rules of the New
York State Board of Real Property Services, the exemption base shall be
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total
assessed value of the parcel on such final assessment roll (after
accounting for any physical or quantity changes to the parcel since the
immediately preceding assessment roll) and the denominator of which
shall be the total assessed value of the parcel on the immediately
preceding final assessment roll. The result shall be the new exemption
base. The exemption shall thereupon be recomputed to take into
account the new exemption base, notwithstanding the fact that the
Assessor receives the certification of the change in level of assessment
after the completion, verification and filing of the final assessment roll.
In the event that the Assessor does not have custody of the roll when
such certification is received, the Assessor shall certify the recomputed
exemption to the local officers having custody and control of the roll,
and such local officers are hereby directed and authorized to enter the
recomputed exemption certified by the Assessor on the roll. The
Assessor shall give written notice of such recomputed exemption to the
property owner, who may, if he or she believes that the exemption was
recomputed incorrectly, apply for a correction in the manner provided
by Title 3 of Article 5 of the New York State Real Property Tax Law for
the correction of clerical errors.

exemption, payments in lieu of taxes or other payments were made to

§ 285-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Tree Preservation and
Land Clearing Law of the Town of Smithtown."
§ 285-2. Findings; intent.
It has been established that trees stabilize the soil, control water pollution
by preventing soil erosion and flooding, absorb air pollution, provide us
with oxygen, yield advantageous microclimatic effects, have an intrinsic,
aesthetic quality, offer a natural barrier to noise and provide a natural
and valuable habitat for wildlife in our area and that the removal of trees
deprives all segments of our society of these benefits while disrupting the
ecological systems of which they are a part. It is, therefore, the intent of the
Town Board of the Town of Smithtown in enacting this chapter to regulate
the destruction and removal of trees to secure these various benefits to the
maximum extent possible for the present and future inhabitants of the Town
of Smithtown.
§ 285-3. Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms, phrases and words
shall have the meanings ascribed herein:
HABIT  The natural growing characteristics of any tree, which includes
branch spread and distribution, branch height above ground and root
spread and distribution.
PERSON  Any individual, firm, partnership, association, corporation,
company, organization or legal entity of any kind, including municipal
corporations or governmental agencies or subdivisions thereof.
REAL PROPERTY  Includes all unimproved real property and improved
property which is either subject to further subdivision within the zoning
district in which it is located or, if nonresidential, is subject to an expansion
or replacement of existing facilities thereon which would result in a greater
percentage of lot area covered by either buildings or appurtenant facilities
in conformance with the Building Zone Ordinance of the Town of
Smithtown.92
TREE  Any living perennial, woody plant, its branches, its root system and
its trunk, if greater than three inches in diameter measured three feet from
ground level and six feet in height measured from ground level.
§ 285-4. Permit required for tree removal; consent of owner.
A. It shall be unlawful for any owner of real property, as defined herein, or
any other person to cause, permit or allow the removal, destruction or

substantial alteration of the habit of any tree on any parcel of real
property, as defined, in the Town of Smithtown without first having
obtained a permit issued therefor as prescribed by this chapter.
B. Notwithstanding the definition of real property heretofore and herein
or anything herein to the contrary, it shall be unlawful for any person,
firm, association, corporation or partnership to cut, damage, carve, dig
or remove any tree, whether living or not living, standing or downed, in
the Town of Smithtown, on public or private property, without the prior
written consent of the owner of said property. Any person having the
prior written consent of the owner or owners of the property to cut,
damage, carve, dig or remove a tree or trees shall display the written
consent of the owner, upon demand, to any police officer of the Suffolk
County Police Department and/or Town of Smithtown employees
empowered to enforce local laws and ordinances of the Town of
Smithtown. The failure to display the written consent of the owner to
cut, damage, carve, dig or remove any tree or trees, upon request by
enforcing authorities, shall be a violation of this chapter. [Amended
7-25-1995 by L.L. No. 4-1995]
A. No person shall be required to obtain a permit as prescribed by § 285-4
of this chapter for the destruction or removal of trees in accordance

of this chapter for the destruction or removal of trees incidental to
surveying and soil investigation activities.
D. Any person doing business as a public utility subject to the jurisdiction
of the New York State Public Service Commission and duly constituted
public agency authorized to provide utility services shall be permitted

approved by the Planning Board or Board of Site Plan Review without
due consideration of such information and of the findings and purpose
of this chapter, as stated in § 285-2. Approval of a subdivision as a final
plat and the official filing of said final plat in the office of the County
Clerk or approval of a site plan by the Town of Smithtown Board of Site
Plan Review pursuant to this section shall relieve the applicant for such
approval of the necessity to obtain a permit required by § 285-4 of this
chapter. The approval and filing in the office of the County Clerk of a
subdivision as a final plat or approval by the Town of Smithtown Board
of Site Plan Review of a site plan pursuant to this section shall give

submitted, subject to such conditions as may be imposed by either the
Planning Board or Board of Site Plan Review upon their approval. In the
event that any person does exceed an approval granted pursuant to this
section for the removal, destruction or alteration of the habit of trees,

chapter. [Amended 7-25-1995 by L.L. No. 4-1995]

Beaches and parks  See Ch. 101. Off-road vehicles  See Ch. 299.
§ 288-1. Trespassing restricted.
It shall be unlawful for any person to trespass upon private property within
the Town of Smithtown or upon public property of the Town of Smithtown,
except such public property of the Town which shall be specifically
designated for the use by the public.
§ 288-2. Construal of trespassing. [Added 3-26-1968]
A person is trespassing within the Town of Smithtown when he enters or
remains unlawfully. A person "enters or remains unlawfully" in or upon
premises when he is not licensed or privileged to do so. A person who,
regardless of his intent, enters or remains in or upon premises which are
at the time opened to the public, does so with license and privilege unless
he defies the lawful order not to enter or remain, personally communicated
to him by the owner of such premises or other authorized person. A license
or privilege to enter or remain in a building which is only partly open to
the public is not a license or privilege to enter or remain in that part of the
building which is not opened to the public. A person who enters or remains
upon unimproved and apparently unused land which is neither fenced
nor otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to exclude intruders does
so with license and privilege unless notice against trespass is personally
communicated to him by the owner of such land or other authorized person
or unless such notice is given by posting in a conspicuous manner.

Any person, firm, association or corporation violating any of the provisions
of any ordinances of the Town of Smithtown shall be guilty of an offense
punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both; however, for the purpose of
confirming jurisdiction upon courts and judicial officers, such violations
shall be deemed to be misdemeanors, and for such purposes only all
provisions of law relating to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any person, firm, association or corporation
violating any provisions of any ordinance of the Town of Smithtown shall
be subject to a penalty in a sum not exceeding $50 for the first such
violation and in a sum not exceeding $100 for any subsequent violation,
said penalties to be recoverable in a civil action in the name of the Town of

will be valid for a period of time only as stated thereon but may be renewed
for thirty-day periods thereafter if, upon investigation, it is found that
conditions warrant renewal. It will not be permitted to use district water for
this purpose through a hour service either on the same or from neighboring

shall be required to furnish a performance bond in an amount equal to
100% of the total amount of the contract before commencement of
work. Such bonds shall be placed with one or more sureties acceptable
to the Board and shall be conditional that the licensee will pay to the
district the amount of all fines or other expenses imposed by the Board
in connection with the performance of the work of the licensee upon
any facility owned by or which at any time in the future may be owned
by the district and further conditioned that the licensee will indemnify
and save the district, the Board and the employees thereof harmless
from liabilities and all damages and injuries resulting directly or
indirectly from an installation, repair, extension or use of the facilities
of the district performed by him and further conditioned that the
licensee will replace and restore to the satisfaction and approval of the
appropriate government authority all streets and pavement removed by
the licensee in connection with the work performed by him. Such
performance bond is to cover and insure the district against defective
material or workmanship of such installations, repairs or improvements
for a period of one year from the date of inspection by the Smithtown
and St. James Water Districts as herein provided. [Amended

A. Purpose.
(1) Due to its scenic and recreational qualities, the operation of water
scooters has caused severe concern for the safety of the people
using and enjoying the Nissequogue River. These water scooters
disturb all matter of shore and shallow wildlife, including but not
limited to wading birds, waterfowl, shore and marsh birds and fish.
Water scooters create excessive amounts of noise which interferes
with the reproduction of wildlife species. This noise also interferes
with the peaceful, quiet enjoyment surrounding the Nissequogue
River.
(2) The Nissequogue River's scenic and recreational qualities make it a
favorite location for fishing and bird- and other wildlife watching.
These same qualities of the river also contribute to a concern for
safety. The narrow, winding portions of the river, although scenic,
do not lend it to all uses. The Nissequogue River's narrow, winding
and constricting portions contribute to a grave safety concern by
creating dangerous blind spots that threaten other users of the
river.
(3) Therefore, it is the intent of the Town Board of the Town of
Smithtown to protect and enhance the quality of the Nissequogue
River and its surrounding environs as well as to protect and
enhance the safety of those individuals enjoying and using the
Nissequogue River.
B. No person shall cruise or operate any water scooter south of the
Smithtown Landing Country Club's southernmost boundary due east
until a point 100 feet east of the mean high-tide mark.
C. Every person convicted of a violation of this section shall, for a first
conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than $250 or by
imprisonment for not more than 15 days, or by both such fine and/or
§ 318-9 SMITHTOWN CODE § 318-10

waterskiing areas or from issuing permits for aquatic events, boat races or
otherwise under proper supervision in limited areas for limited periods of
time, provided that prior permission for the aforesaid is obtained from the

which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage
at the time of initial construction.

projects.

with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of
the general public.

water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines,
streets and bridges located in areas of special flood
hazard.

use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as
to minimize future flood blight areas.

§ 322-30. Satellite dish antennas. [Added 9-11-1984; amended
5-28-1991]
The Town Board finds that dish antennas, due to their shape, opacity and
size, create more of a visual impact on the community than do other types
of antennas. The intent of these regulations is to permit the reception
of satellite transmissions in the Town while simultaneously preventing,
avoiding or minimizing the visual contrast of such antennas with regard to
the elements of line, form, scale and color.

pursuant to § 242-11 of Chapter 242.
(4) The Board may approve the application as submitted, recommend

Board shall have the additional authority to grant area variances
simultaneously with final plat approval, provided that all of the
following conditions are met:
(1) The change does not alter the density required by the zoning
district.
(2) The change complies with § 322-19, Environmentally sensitive
lands.
(3) The change would result in the addition of not more than one lot to
the proposed subdivision, provided it does not alter the density of
the zoning district.

1:867
(4) When, in the Board's judgement, the change meets one or more of
the following objectives:
(a) There is a public purpose or benefit in changing the
requirement pattern;
(b) The alteration, such as a frontage reduction, is consistent with
the surrounding lots;
(c) The change would preserve historically significant structures
or features of the Town;
(d) The change would preserve, protect, or promote scenic or
environmentally sensitive lands;
(e) The alteration would better protect the homeowner from
undesirable land uses;
(f) The change would reduce the amount of regrading or clearing
of property;
(g) The change would be incidental or minor and not alter the
character of the neighborhood.
B. In making its determination as to granting any area variance, the
Planning Board shall grant the minimum variance that it shall deem
necessary and adequate and at the same time preserves and protects
the character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of
the community. In making such determination, the Planning Board shall
consider and render a determination in accordance with the following
standards and criteria:
(1) Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the character
of the neighborhood or detriment to nearby properties will be
created by the granting of the area variance;
(2) Whether a benefit sought by an applicant can be achieved by some
method, feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than by an area
variance;
(3) Whether the proposed variance is substantial;
(4) Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or
impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the
neighborhood or district; and
(5) Whether the alleged difficulty necessitating the area variance was
self-created by an applicant, which consideration shall be relevant
to the decision of the Planning Board, but shall not necessarily
preclude the granting of the area variance.

ARTICLE V
Overlay Districts145
[Added 4-8-2014]
§ 322-31. Declaration of policy and purposes.
The Town Board finds that there are areas of the Town that develop with
a specific, consistent character such that they may be treated as a distinct
entity for purposes of regulating dimensional, use, and other zoning
standards. The regulations in this Article V are intended to permit
expansion or restriction of the standards of the zoning district(s) in which
such an area is situated, provided that the area, boundaries and the specific
permitted variation from standards shall have been established as an
overlay district by the Town Board. The purpose of this article is to establish
standards and procedures which will foster healthy growth and orderly
development within each overlay district so established.
§ 322-32. Criteria for overlay districts.
In order for an area to be designated an overlay district, it shall meet the
following criteria:
§ 322-33. Procedure.
A. There shall be multiple lots and multiple property owners within the
district boundaries delineated on the Town's Zoning Map.
B. There shall be specific characteristics that set the area apart from the
balance of the zoning district(s) in which it is located, which
characteristics shall be enumerated in the designation of the area as an
overlay district.
C. There shall be a public purpose(s) served by the designation of an area
as an overlay district, and the designation of the district shall specify
how the expansion or restriction of the standards of the underlying
zoning district supports such purpose(s).
A. If the Town Board determines to establish an overlay district, it shall do
so pursuant to the procedures outlined in Article XIV herein.
B. A proposed overlay district shall include:
(1) A description of the boundaries of the area to be designated as the
overlay district;
(2) A description of purpose(s) for creating the overlay district in
accordance with § 322-32;

The Town Board may, upon written application pursuant to the
requirements of Article XIV of this chapter and its sections, consider and
permit the change of the zone designation of a parcel of land to the PRD
District and apply the zoning regulations of this district and establish any
supplementary regulations thereto, wherein the health, safety and general

as to promote the most appropriate use of the land and to preserve the
natural and scenic amenities of an area. Any area changed to the Planned
Residential Development District shall have applications for building
permits issued and construction started, as well as site construction, in
accordance with the approved site plan within 18 months from the date
of Town Board approval; otherwise, the Town Board may, upon its own
initiative, hold a public hearing and revert the zoning back to its previous
classification.

condition shall be in writing and shall be served upon the owner or any
other person responsible for the sign, either by personal service or by
posting same at a conspicuous location at the subject site and sending a
copy thereof to such person by certified mail. Upon the failure to

to establish, within said time period, that no such condition exists, the
sign permit may be revoked.
C. The Director of Public Safety or the Building Director may require the
repair, removal or other remedial measure with respect to a sign on
§ 322-72 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 322-72.1
1:897
§ 322-72.2. Amortization.
Any sign, other than a temporary sign, lawfully existing prior to the effective
date of this article, which, by virtue hereof, does not conform to the
requirements of this article, shall be permitted to remain in place for a
period of up to two years from the effective date hereof, until expiration of
any permit therefor; provided that any such sign is maintained in good state
private property that poses a hazard to public safety. Notice of such
requirement and the reasons therefor shall be in writing and shall
be served upon the owner or any other person responsible for the
sign, either by personal service or by posting same at a conspicuous
location at the subject site and sending a copy of same to such person
by certified mail. Upon the failure to correct the condition within 10
days after such written notification, or to establish, within said time
period, that no such hazardous condition exists, either director may, but
shall not be required to, cause the repair, removal or other remedial
measure with respect to any such sign. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Director of Public Safety or the Building Director may require or
cause the immediate repair, removal or other remedial measure with
respect to any such sign, with or without notice to the owner or any
other person responsible for the sign, if either director determines
that said sign poses an immediate hazard to public safety. Nothing
contained herein, however, shall require either director to make any
such determination or to so act in accordance therewith. In any
instance in which any such sign is repaired, removed or otherwise
remediated by the Town, pursuant to this paragraph, in addition to
any other fine or penalty provided under this chapter, the Town shall
assess all costs incurred for such service against the owner or any other
person responsible for the sign, said costs to be recoverable in a civil
action in the name of the Town of Smithtown.
D. Any person who causes or permits any sign to be placed or posted on,
within, or encroaching upon or over any Town property and/or
including the property within any portion of the entire width of the
right-of-way boundary lines of any Town street or highway, or on any
appurtenance therein, other than in conformity with this chapter, shall
be in violation of this chapter. Any such sign shall be subject to
immediate removal and destruction, without notice, as authorized by
the Director of Public Safety, the Building Director, and/or the
department head responsible for the maintenance thereof. In lieu of the
administration and enforcement provisions under Chapter 322 Article
XV of the Town Code, in any action for an alleged violation of this
paragraph, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that a person whose
name, telephone number, or other identifying information appears on
any such sign shall be in violation hereof, for which such person shall be
subject to a civil penalty, for each such violation, in a sum of not more
than $50 for the first violation and not more than $100 for each
subsequent violation, said penalties to be recoverable in a civil action in
the name of the Town of Smithtown.

of repair. Such sign and sign assemblages shall be brought into compliance
with current requirements or shall be dismantled and removed from their
location prior to the expiration of such period. The failure to comply with

§ 322-72.3. Severability.
If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part of this article shall
be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unconstitutional, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the
remaining portions hereof, but shall be confined to the clause, sentence,
paragraph, section or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in
which such judgment shall have been rendered.

caused unnecessary hardship. In order to prove such unnecessary
hardship the applicant shall demonstrate to the Board that for each and
every permitted use under the zoning regulations for the particular
district where the property is located:
(1) The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that
lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent
financial evidence:
(2) That the alleged hardship relating to the property in question is
unique, and does not apply to a substantial portion of the district or

B. Area variances. Pursuant to § 267-b(3) of the Town Law, in making its
determination, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall take into
consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted, as
weighted against the detriment to the health, safety and welfare of the
neighborhood or community by such grant, and:
(1) Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the character
of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby properties will be
created by the granting of the area variance;
(2) Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by
some method, feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than an
area variance;
(3) Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
(4) Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or
impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the
neighborhood or district; and
(5) Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Board, but
shall not necessarily preclude the granting of the area variance.
C. The Board shall grant the minimum variance that it shall deem
necessary and adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the
community.

1:922
D. In cases where the lot does not meet the area and/or frontage

as to permit a use not otherwise permitted, provided that the Board
determines that the change would be beneficial to the community.

interpretation of a word or words, the Board shall consider the intent of
the provision in question and also the definition of terms as described in
the Town Code, professional publications, and standard references.

of the precise location of a district boundary line, the Board shall
consider public records on file in the Town.

injury of others.
(b) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.

owner.
(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the Town.
(e) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
(f) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive
Plan and floodplain management program of that area.
(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.

action, if applicable, expected at the site.
(l) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations,
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges.
(2) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the
items in § 322-83H(1)(a) through (l) have been fully considered.
(3) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(a) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
(b) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
(4) Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(a) The criteria of Subsection H(6) of this section are met.
(b) The structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create
no additional threat to public safety.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(6) Variances shall be issued only upon receiving written justification
of:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of a public or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
§ 322-83 SMITHTOWN CODE § 322-83
1:924
(7) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written
notice over the signature of a Clerk to the Board that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from lowest-floor elevation.

Site Plan Review
[Added 6-25-1985; amended 9-10-1985; 12-7-1985; 1-7-1986;
10-21-1986; 1-3-1989; 10-21-1989; 8-14-1990; 7-9-1991; 9-29-1998]
§ 322-84. Declaration of policy.
The Town Board hereby finds that all forms of private and public
developments within the Town, exclusive of the incorporated villages,
should proceed along the lines of good order and with due regard for
the public interest, including but not limited to the public health, safety
and welfare. The quality of a site's design can have a significant effect
on the value of the surrounding properties and, subsequently, municipal
tax revenues. Poor site design can not only destroy the proper balance
in relationship between the taxable value of real property and the cost of
municipal services provided, but can also diminish the numerous positive
benefits that land use and development usually provide to the property
owner. Accordingly, a reasonable degree of control should be exercised over
the character of private and public land use and development, including
but not limited to the exterior design of new or renovated structures and
portions thereof, the construction and location of parking areas, with or
without new building construction, changes in the use of existing structures
and the use of open land.
§ 322-85. General provisions. [Amended 12-9-2003; 7-26-2005]
A. Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to encourage good site design
so as to:
(1) Protect the established character of the adjoining properties, both
public and private, and of the neighborhoods in which they are
located.
(2) Prevent the depreciation of the value of adjoining properties, both
public and private, and of the neighborhoods in which they are
located.
(3) Lessen and, where possible, prevent traffic congestion on the
streets and highways upon which the site fronts or which provide
vehicular or pedestrian access thereto.
(4) Prevent the overcrowding of land or buildings.
(5) Secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers, and to provide
adequate light, air and convenience of access.
(6) Promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the
community in which said proposed sites are located.
B. Site plan required. Except as provided in § 322-85C and D, the following
activities shall not be permitted except in conformity with a site plan

(4) The installation or pruning of plants or the replacement of dead or
diseased plants with specimens of the same species and size as
originally approved.
(5) Routine property maintenance or repair not involving a change of
material or design, such as painting, roof repairs and repaving
