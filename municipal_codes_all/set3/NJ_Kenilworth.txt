General Provisions
§ 37-4. General policy.
A. It is the policy of the Borough of Kenilworth to treat employees and
prospective employees in a manner consistent with all applicable
employment laws and regulations. The personnel policies and
procedures of the Borough shall apply to all employees, volunteers,
elected or appointed officials and independent contractors. In the event
there is a conflict between these rules and any collective bargaining
agreement, personnel services contract, or federal or state law,
including the Attorney General's guidelines with respect to Police
Department personnel matters, the terms and conditions of that
contract or law shall prevail. In all other cases, these policies and
procedures shall prevail.
B. All employees, officers and department heads shall be appointed and
promoted by the governing body. No person shall be employed or
promoted unless there exists a position created by an ordinance
adopted by the governing body as well as the necessary budget
appropriation and salary ordinance.
C. The Borough Clerk and all managerial/supervisory personnel are
authorized and responsible for personnel policies and procedures. The
governing body has appointed the Borough's Chief Financial Officer to
assist the Borough Clerk to implement personnel practices. The
Borough Clerk and the Borough Chief Financial Officer shall also have
access to the Borough's Labor Counsel appointed by the governing
body from time to time for guidance in personnel matters. [Amended
at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II)]
D. As a general principle, the Borough has a "no tolerance" policy towards
workplace wrongdoing. Borough officials, employees and independent
contractors are to report anything perceived to be improper. The
Borough believes strongly in an open door policy and encourages
employees to talk with their supervisor, department head, Clerk and/or
Chief Financial Officer concerning any problem. [Amended at time of
adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
E. The Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual adopted by the
governing body is intended to provide guidelines covering public
service by Borough employees and is not a contract. This manual
contains many, but not necessarily all, of the rules, regulations, and
conditions of employment for Borough personnel. The provisions of this
manual may be amended and supplemented from time to time without
notice and at the sole discretion of the Borough.

ARTICLE III
Employee Rights and Obligations Policies
§ 37-5. Antidiscrimination.
The Borough is committed to the principle of equal employment opportunity
pursuant to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act as amended by the
Equal Opportunity Act of 1972. Under no circumstances will the Borough
discriminate on the basis of sex, race, creed, color, religion, national origin,
ancestry, age, marital or political status, disability, or sexual orientation.
Decisions regarding hiring, promotion, transfer, demotion or termination
are based solely on the qualifications and performance of the employee or
prospective employee. If any employees or prospective employees feel they
have been treated unfairly, they have the right to address their concern with
their supervisor, or, if they prefer, their department head, Borough Clerk, or
the Personnel Committee of the governing body.
§ 37-6. Americans with Disabilities Act.
§ 37-7. Contagious or life-threatening illnesses.
A. In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and the New
Jersey Law Against Discrimination,23 the Borough does not discriminate
based on disability. The Borough will endeavor to make every work
environment handicap accessible, and all future construction and
renovation of facilities will be in accordance with applicable barrierfree
federal and state regulations and the Americans with Disabilities
Act Accessibility Guidelines.
B. The Borough Clerk shall initiate an interactive dialogue with disabled
employees and prospective employees to identify reasonable
accommodations that do not create a hardship. Accommodations
include modifications to facilities, equipment and work procedures,
auxiliary aides, services and permanent reassignment to vacant
positions. Employees who are reassigned to a different position shall
receive the salary of their new position. Accommodations shall not be
unduly expensive, extensive and disruptive or fundamentally alter the
nature of the operation. The Act does not require the Borough to offer
permanent "light duty," relocate essential functions or provide
personal-use items such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, wheelchairs, etc.
To be eligible for accommodations, individuals must 1) be able to
perform the essential function of the position, 2) not create a real safety
hazard to themselves, co-employees or the public, and 3) be otherwise
qualified for the position in that they possess the prerequisites,
including education, experience, training, skills, licenses or certificates
and other job-related requirements. All decisions with respect to
accommodations shall be made by the Borough Clerk or the governing
body as appropriate.

§ 37-8. Safety.
§ 37-9. Temporary reassignment of duties. [Amended 12-8-2010 by
Ord. No. 2010-18]
A. The Borough of Kenilworth encourages employees with contagious
diseases or life-threatening illnesses such as cancer, heart disease,
Hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS to continue their normal pursuits, including
work, to the extent allowed by their condition. As in the case of other
disabilities, the Borough shall make reasonable accommodations in
accordance with legal requirements to allow qualified employees with
contagious or life-threatening illnesses to perform the essential
functions of their jobs as long as they are able to meet acceptable
performance standards.
B. Medical information shall be treated confidentially. The Borough will
take reasonable precautions to protect such information from
inappropriate disclosure. Managers and other employees have a
responsibility to maintain the confidentially of employee medical
information. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information shall
be subject to disciplinary action.
C. Employees with questions or concerns about contagious or lifethreatening
illnesses are encouraged to contact the Borough Clerk.
A. The Borough will provide a safe and healthy work environment and
shall comply with the Public Employees Occupational Safety and Health
Act (PEOSHA). The Borough is equally concerned about the safety of
the public. Consistent with this policy, employees will receive periodic
safety training and will be provided with appropriate safety equipment.
Employees are responsible for observing safety rules and using
available safety devices, including personal protective equipment.
Failure to do so constitutes grounds for disciplinary action. Any
occupational or public unsafe condition, practice, procedure or act
must be immediately reported to the supervisor or department head.
Any on-the-job accident or accident involving Borough facilities,
equipment or motor vehicles must also be immediately reported.
B. The Borough has appointed a Safety Committee that meets on a regular
basis to discuss and recommend solutions to safety problems.
Employees are encouraged to discuss safety concerns with their Safety
Committee representative.
A. Background.
(1) Workers' compensation laws provide lost wages and medical
expenses to employees who are injured as a result of an on-the-job
accident, injury, or occupational disease. Workers' compensation is
designed to protect employees and their dependents against
hardships from injury or death arising from the work environment.
All permanent and temporary employees of the Borough of
§ 37-7 KENILWORTH CODE § 37-9
1:84
Kenilworth ("Borough") are covered by workers' compensation
insurance.
(2) In an effort to continue to provide innovative and quality service to
its employees, the Borough is pleased to provide a Temporary
Reassignment of Duties Program ("program"). The program is
designed to assign duties and responsibilities to employees covered
by the workers' compensation laws which are consistent with
specific medical restrictions, which will provide the Borough with
increased efficiency from its work force, as well as provide higher
self-esteem for affected workers.
(3) The program is intended for those employees who have been
injured on the job, and who, under medical authorization, may
return to work in a limited capacity.
(4) Issues arising under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or the New Jersey Law
against Discrimination (LAD) are not covered by this policy. Those
issues shall be handled in accordance with law.
B. Description of the program. The program is designated to provide
temporary modified or alternate work assignments, where available, to
employees who are deemed temporarily unable to perform their regular
work duties or assignment due to a work-related illness or injury. This
procedure will allow employees who are not fully capable of resuming
their job responsibilities to return to a work assignment that is tailored
to the individual's temporary limitations.
C. Objective of the program.
(1) To return employees to work who have been injured on the job.
These employees may temporarily perform duties to assist the
Borough in providing services to the general public. The job duties
must have requirements consistent with the employee's health
limitations as certified by a physician.
(2) To lower the absenteeism rate.
(3) To minimize the negative psychological impact due to being out of
work, and to provide a transition and adjustment for returning to
work.
(4) To create a safe work environment and sound safety practices.
(5) To reduce disruption of the work schedule.
(6) To assist employees in returning to their regular job duties at full
capacity.
(7) To increase the productivity of the Borough's work force. In order
to assist the Borough to continue to provide services to its citizens,
it is the Borough's policy to have these employees who are not
§ 37-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 37-9
1:85
totally disabled come to work and perform those functions which
they are able to perform.
D. Benefits of the program.
(1) Increased morale. The program allows injured workers to feel
needed in their job. This increases morale.
(2) Productivity. The program allows employees who are temporarily
reassigned to perform tasks regardless of whether there are other
personnel available to do them.
(3) Self-esteem. The program keeps employees motivated and mobile,
makes them feel productive and facilitates the healing process.
E. Administration of the program.
(1) The program shall be administered by the employee's department
head in conjunction with the Borough's Personnel Committee.
(2) Employees injured on the job are required to be examined by a
health care provider authorized to treat the workers' compensation
injury ("authorized physician"). Employees may be required to
report to the authorized physician with their job description to
enable the physician to ascertain what duties the employee is able
to perform until the employee has been medically cleared to return
to full duty. The Borough will not accept a nonauthorized
physician's recommendation, nor will the Borough reimburse an
employee under this policy for treatment by a nonauthorized
physician.
(3) The authorized physician's report(s) shall be reviewed to determine
appropriate reassignment. The final determination of the employee
for the alternate or modified assignments will be that of the
Personnel Committee.
(4) There shall be regular communication among the Personnel
Committee, the department head, the employee, the authorized
physician(s), and the workers' compensation carrier and
administrator throughout the course of treatment and recovery.
(5) The Borough shall maintain documentation regarding employee
status in the program.
(6) Within 10 working days after an employee commences a temporary
reassignment, and periodically thereafter, a review shall be
performed to determine the appropriateness of continuing the
temporary reassignment.
(7) All employees shall be given a copy of this policy. The policy shall
be maintained in the Borough's Policy Manual.
§ 37-9 KENILWORTH CODE § 37-9
1:86
(8) The Personnel Committee, in conjunction with the workers'
compensation carrier or administrator, must notify the authorized
physicians about the program.
(9) All reassignments under this policy are temporary. There are no
permanent modified or alternate work assignments.
(10) The Borough reserves the right to require an employee returning
from temporary reassignment under this policy to submit to a
fitness-for-duty examination.
F. Employee requirements.
(1) Employees are required to perform the job tasks they are assigned
pursuant to this program.
(2) Employees are required to cooperate with and follow their
supervisors' directions.
(3) Employees are required to attend all appointments with authorized
physicians.
(4) Employees must provide all authorized physicians' notes and
reports to their department head. The department head shall
provide a copy of all authorized physicians' notes to the Personnel
Committee.
(5) An employee who rejects temporary reassignment may become
ineligible for workers' compensation benefits. In addition, once an
employee's entitlement to leave pursuant to the FMLA has been
exhausted, the employee who rejects temporary reassignment will
be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
G. Assignment of job tasks.
(1) Temporary reassignment will be determined in conjunction with
the limitations set forth by authorized physician(s).
(2) Temporary reassignments will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
(3) There shall be regular communication between the Personnel
Committee and the employee's department head. The department
head shall notify and coordinate with the Personnel Committee
regarding the tasks that have been assigned to an employee.
(4) Upon request by the Personnel Committee, supervisors shall
provide a list of assignments that are in need of being done which
feasibly may be completed by an employee on modified duty.
(5) There is no restriction on the location or type of temporary
reassignment, provided it is consistent with the limitation detailed
by the Borough authorized physician and assists in continuing to
provide services to the Borough's citizens.
§ 37-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 37-9
1:87
§ 37-10. Drugs and alcohol.
§ 37-11. Workplace violence.
H. Compliance with laws. The program shall be interpreted to be
consistent with the FMLA, ADA and the LAD, and all other laws. To the
extent any provision in the program conflicts with any federal or State
of New Jersey law, the law shall control, but the balance of the program
shall remain in effect.
A. The Borough recognizes that the use of unlawful drugs and the abuse of
alcohol pose a threat to the health and safety of all employees. Any
employee who is intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol or drugs
during working hours shall be immediately suspended and subject to
termination. The supervisor or department head will immediately
report any suspensions to the Borough Clerk.
B. Employees using prescription drugs that may affect job performance or
safety must notify their supervisor or department head, who is required
to maintain the confidentiality of any information regarding an
employee's medical condition. Borough personnel who hold a
commercial driver's license (CDL) are subject to the provisions of the
Commercial Driver's Licenses Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy.
A. The Borough will not tolerate workplace violence. Violent acts or
threats made by an employee against another person or property are
cause for immediate dismissal and will be fully prosecuted. This
includes any violence or threats made on Borough property, at Borough
events or under other circumstances that may negatively affect the
Borough's ability to conduct business.
B. Prohibited conduct includes:
(1) Causing physical injury to another person;
(2) Making threatening remarks;
(3) Aggressive or hostile behavior that creates a reasonable fear of
injury to another person or subjects another individual to emotional
distress;
(4) Intentionally damaging employer property or property of another
employee;
(5) Possession of a weapon while on Borough property or while on
Borough business, except with the authority of the Police Chief;
and
(6) Committing acts motivated by, or related to, sexual harassment or
domestic violence.
§ 37-9 KENILWORTH CODE § 37-11
1:88
§ 37-12. General anti-harassment.
The Borough will not tolerate harassment in the workplace, including
harassment motivated by sex, race, creed, color, religion, national origin,
ancestry, age, nationality, marital or political status, disability or sexual
orientation. Borough officials, appointees, managers, supervisors,
employees, volunteers and outside contractors alike must comply with this
policy and take appropriate measures to insure that such conduct does
not occur. Violations of this policy will result in disciplinary action up to
and including discharge or, in the event nonemployees are found to be at
fault, other appropriate action. Employees who feel they have been subject
to harassment must report the harassment to their supervisor, or, if they
prefer, to the department head, Borough Clerk or the Personnel Committee
of the governing body. See the employee Complaint Policy.24
§ 37-13. Anti-sexual harassment.
C. Any potentially dangerous situations must be immediately reported.
The Borough will actively intervene in any potentially hostile or violent
situation.
A. As a part of the Anti-Harassment Policy, the Borough also strictly
prohibits sexual harassment, including, but not limited to:
(1) Making unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors a
condition of employment;
(2) Making submission to or rejection of such conduct the basis for
employment decisions affecting the employee;
(3) Creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment
by such conduct;
(4) Making unwelcome, offensive remarks or engaging in physical
contact with a subordinate or fellow employee that would not have
been made but for the employee's sex or which is sexually oriented
to the extent that it would not occur but for the fact of the
employee's gender; or
(5) Harassment based solely on gender, which creates a hostile and
offensive work environment.
B. Sexual harassment may take different forms. One specific form is a
demand for sexual favors. Other forms of harassment include, but are
not limited to:
(1) Sexual innuendoes, suggestive comments, jokes of a sexual nature,
sexual propositions or threats;

§ 37-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 37-13
1:89
§ 37-14. Whistle-blowers.
(2) Suggestive objects or pictures, graphic commentaries, e-mails,
suggestive or insulting sounds, leering, whistling, obscene
gestures;
(3) Unwanted physical contact, including touching, pinching, brushing
the body, pushing; or
(4) Nonsexual conduct such as intimidation and hostility based solely
upon gender.
C. Employees who feel they have been subject to sexual harassment must
report the harassment to their supervisor, or, if they prefer, to the
department head, Borough Clerk or the Personnel Committee of the
governing body. See the employee Complaint Policy. [Amended at
time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
A. Employees have the right to complain of anything they perceive to be
improper. This right shall be communicated to all employees in a letter
outlining the specific employee complaint procedure. A written
acknowledgment that the employee received this letter will be included
in the employee's official personnel file. This right will also be
communicated in the employee handbook. All complaints will be taken
seriously and promptly investigated.
B. The Borough shall not take any retaliatory action or tolerate any
reprisal against an employee for any of the following:
(1) Disclosing or threatening to disclose to a supervisor, department
head, the Borough Clerk, other official or to a public body, as
defined in the Employment Protection Act (N.J.S.A. 34:19), an
activity, policy or practice that the employee reasonably believes is
in violation of law, a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to
law;
(2) Providing information to or testifying before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, an inquiry into any violation
of law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law; or
(3) Objecting to or refusing to participate in any activity, policy, or
practice that the employee reasonably believes is a violation of a
law, rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law; is fraudulent
or criminal; or is incompatible with a clear public policy mandate
concerning the public health, safety, or welfare.
C. In accordance with the statute, the employee must bring the violation to
the attention of the Borough. However, disclosure is not required where
1) the employee is reasonably certain that the violation is known to one
or more officials; 2) where the employee reasonably fears physical
harm; or 3) the situation is emergency in nature. Employees are
encouraged to complain in writing using the employee complaint form
§ 37-13 KENILWORTH CODE § 37-14
1:90
§ 37-15. Employee complaints.
Employees who wish to complain of harassment or any other workplace
wrongdoing are requested to immediately report the matter to their
supervisor, or, if they prefer, to their department head, the Borough Clerk or
the Personnel Committee of the governing body. Employees are encouraged
to complain in writing using the employee complaint form but may make
a verbal complaint at their discretion. No retaliatory measures shall be
taken against any employee who complains of workplace wrongdoing. The
Borough will, to the maximum extent feasible, maintain the confidentiality
of such complaints on a need-to-know basis. However, investigation of such
complaints may require disclosure to the accused party and other witnesses
in order to gather pertinent facts.
§ 37-16. Grievances.
but may make a verbal complaint at their discretion. See the employee
Complaint Policy. Under the law, the employee must give the Borough
a reasonable opportunity to correct the activity, policy or practice.
The administration of whistle blower complaints is not subject to the
limitations in the Grievance Policy. In accordance with the statute, a
copy of this policy will be posted in all facilities.
A. A "grievance" is any formal dispute concerning the interpretation,
application and enforcement of any personnel policy or procedure of
the Borough. Grievances from union employees will be handled
pursuant to the terms of the applicable bargaining unit agreement. All
grievances from nonunion employees must be presented within five
working days after arising and failure to report a grievance within such
time shall be deemed as a waiver of the grievance. In the event of a
settlement or ruling that results in a determination of monetary liability,
such liability shall not exceed more than 30 working days prior to the
date the grievance was first presented in writing.
(1) Step 1. Any employee or group of employees with a grievance shall
verbally communicate the grievance to the supervisor or
department head. The supervisor or department head will
communicate the decision to the employee within two working
days.
(2) Step 2. If the employee is not satisfied with the decision, the
employee must submit a written grievance to the Borough Clerk
detailing the facts and the relief requested. The decision in Step 1
will be deemed final if the employee fails to submit a written
grievance within five working days of the Step 1 decision. Upon
receipt of such written grievance, the Borough Clerk shall schedule
a hearing before the governing body, or its designee, within 21 days
of receipt of the written grievance. The governing body, or its
designee, shall render a decision within 15 working days after such
meeting is held, which decision shall be in writing and either hand-
§ 37-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 37-16
1:91
§ 37-17. Access to personnel files.
The official personnel file for each employee shall be maintained by the
Borough Clerk. Personnel files are confidential records that must be
secured in a locked cabinet and will only be available to authorized
managerial and supervisory personnel on a need-to-know basis. Records
relating to any medical condition will be maintained in a separate file.
Electronic personnel and medical records must be protected from
unauthorized access. Any employees may review their file in the presence
of the Borough Clerk upon reasonable request.
§ 37-18. Conflicts of interest.
delivered or mailed to the employee and the department head. The
decision of the governing body shall be final, subject, however, to
any other rights or remedies to which the employee may be entitled
under state and federal law. The governing body may appoint a
hearing officer for the purpose of hearing any grievance at Step 2.
B. These limitations do not apply to employee complaints made under the
General Anti-Harassment Policy, the Anti-Sexual Harassment Policy or
the Whistle-Blower Policy.25
A. Employees, including Borough officials, must conduct business
according to the highest ethical standards of public service. Employees
are expected to devote their best efforts to the interests of the Borough.
Violations of this policy will result in appropriate discipline, including
termination.
B. The Borough recognizes the right of employees to engage in outside
activities that are private in nature and unrelated to Borough business.
However, business dealings that appear to create a conflict between the
employee and the Borough's interests are unlawful under the New
Jersey Local Government Ethics Act.26 Under the Act, certain
employees and officials are required to annually file with the Borough
Clerk a state mandated disclosure form. The Borough Clerk will notify
employees and Borough officials subject to the filing requirements of
the Act.
C. A potential or actual conflict of interest occurs whenever an employee,
including a Borough official, is in a position to influence a Borough
decision that may result in a personal gain for the employee or an
immediate relative, including a spouse or significant other, child,
parent, stepchild, sibling, grandparents, daughter-in-law, son-in-law,
grandchildren, niece, nephew, uncle, aunt, or any person related by
blood or marriage residing in an employee's household. Employees are
required to disclose possible conflicts so that the Borough may assess
and prevent potential conflicts. If there are any questions whether an

§ 37-19. Political activity.
Employees have exactly the same right as any other citizen to join political

keys and equipment. At this time, the employee will sign the termination
memo designating all money owed, and this memo will be retained in the
official personnel file.
§ 37-54. Workers' compensation.
Employees who suffer job-related injuries and illnesses may be entitled
to medical expenses, lost income and other compensation under the New
Jersey Workers' Compensation Act.29 The Borough covers workers'
compensation benefits through its membership in a joint insurance fund.
Any occupational injury or illness must be immediately reported to the
supervisor or department head. All required medical treatment must be
performed by a workers' compensation physician appointed by the joint
insurance fund, and payment for unauthorized medical treatment may not
be covered pursuant to the Act.

the Borough and the union representing the Kenilworth Police
Department.
B. The complete benefit plan is on file in the Borough Clerk's office, and a
summary plan description will be provided to all employees. Benefit
levels for nonunionized employees are subject to change at the
discretion of the Borough.
A. Goal of policy. The goal of this policy is to balance the Borough's respect
for individuals with the need to maintain a safe, productive and alcohol/
drug-free environment. The intent of this policy is to offer a helping

hand to those who need it, while sending a clear message that the
improper consumption of alcohol or illegal use of drugs is incompatible
with employment with the Borough.
B. Objective. The Borough recognizes the health implications of alcohol
abuse and drug use on its employees and considers it a treatable illness.
As with other illnesses, the Borough's primary objective is to assist in
the employee's rehabilitation. The Borough designed this policy to
encourage employees to voluntarily seek help for any alcohol or
substance abuse problem.
C. Rehabilitation program. An employee may voluntarily admit to the
Borough that he or she has an alcohol or substance abuse problem
without fear of discipline or discharge. Upon admission of an alcohol or
substance abuse problem, the employee shall immediately enroll
himself or herself in a rehabilitation program at the employee's sole
cost and expense. The Borough will not take disciplinary action against
an employee who voluntarily admits having an alcohol or substance
abuse problem unless that employee refuses to enroll in and complete a
rehabilitation program. Upon return to work after satisfactorily
completing a rehabilitation program, the employee must agree to
submit to the random follow-up testing. Employees who test positive in
a subsequent drug and/or alcohol test or who voluntarily enter
rehabilitation on more than one occasion shall be subject to disciplinary
action, up to and including discharge. Nothing in the foregoing shall
preclude the employee from obtaining coverage and/or reimbursement
for payments made for rehabilitation services from any applicable
insurance coverage.
D. Screening tests. The governing body shall be responsible for the
selection of a qualified laboratory to perform the appropriate drug and/
or alcohol screening tests and shall also be responsible for selecting
physicians to conduct physical examinations and drug and/or alcohol
screening tests where appropriate.
A. Subject to sufficient funds in the budget and upon approval of the
department head, employees may apply for reimbursement of tuition
expenses incurred for training or college courses directly related to the
employee's work. The Borough Clerk will be the sole judge of whether a
particular course or program is "directly related" to the employee's
work, and such course or program must be preapproved by the Borough
Clerk to qualify for reimbursement.
B. Employees may receive reimbursement for up to $500 per year towards
the tuition cost for training or college courses that they take on their
own initiative. The reimbursement must be repaid if the employee
leaves Borough employment within 24 months of receipt. When
enrollment for short training courses or seminars is requested by the
Borough, employees will receive full reimbursement.
§ 37-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 37-57
1:111
§ 37-57. Conferences and seminars.
Requests to attend a conference or seminar must be approved by the
department head and the Borough Clerk. Requests shall be made
sufficiently in advance to take advantage of discounts for early registration
and must be submitted to the department head at least 30 days before
the event. Requests must be in writing, including the conference schedule,
registration information and estimated costs. The department head is
responsible to detail all training requests during the budget formulation
process. Approval of any conference or seminar request is conditioned upon
the availability of funds.
§ 37-58. Terminal leave.
§ 37-59. Longevity compensation.
A. All full-time permanent employees hired on or before December 31,
1995, who retire with less than 25 years of service with the Borough
and who qualify for a pension under state law by reason of length of
service or service-connected disability shall be entitled to terminal
leave in the amount of 1 1/2 days for every year of full time service.
B. All full-time permanent employees hired on or before December 31,
1995, who retire with 25 years of service or more with the Borough and
who qualify for a pension under state law by reason of length of service

amount of two days for every year of full-time service.
A. Eligibility. All full-time employees hired on or before December 31,
1995, shall be entitled to longevity compensation in accordance with
this section. Any employee hired on or after January 1, 1996, shall not
be eligible for longevity compensation. An employee must work an
average of at least 35 hours per week in any year of service to be
eligible.
B. Calculation of amount. In addition to the salaries payable, all eligible
employees shall receive a longevity payment calculated with reference
to the employee's base salary in effect on the December 31 of the
calendar year preceding the date of payment. The amount of the
longevity payment shall be calculated in accordance with the following

consecutive or nonconsecutive, and whether served on a full-time or a
part-time basis, as defined above. Any interruption of service due to a
cause beyond the control of the employee, such as military service,
injury in the line of duty or illness, shall be considered as service for the
purpose of determining the length of service. Leaves of absence
granted at the request of the employee shall not be considered in
determining length of service.
A. All employees traveling on preapproved Borough business or using
personal assets for Borough purchases shall be compensated for
expenses according to the following schedule:
(1) Lodging and meals: all reasonable, preapproved expenses.
(2) Purchases: all verified, preapproved expenses.
(3) Automobile expenses: in accordance with the Internal Revenue
Service standard mileage rates for employees, self-employed
individuals, or other taxpayers to use in computing the deductible
costs of operating an automobile for business, charitable, medical,
or moving expense purposes.
B. All travel expenses must be itemized and accompanied with receipts.
The appropriate department head must approve the expenses prior to
reimbursement, except that any expense or expenses in excess of $150
must be approved by the governing body.

ARTICLE VII
Managerial and Supervisory Procedures
§ 37-61. Employment procedure.
A. Recruitment. The Borough Clerk will coordinate the employment
recruitment process for all vacancies to ensure compliance with
contractual, legal and equal opportunity requirements. When a vacancy
occurs, it is the responsibility of the department head to notify the
Borough Clerk, who will distribute notification of the vacancy to all
departments. The Borough Clerk will undertake to recruit qualified
applicants in accordance with applicable federal and state law. Where
positions are advertised, the media or other periodical utilized must
have as wide circulation as possible to encourage applications from
candidates from diverse backgrounds and must prominently state that
the Borough is an equal opportunity employer.
B. Applications. All candidates must fully complete an application form. A
resume will not be considered as a substitute for this form. The
application is a confidential document and will not be available to
anyone who is not directly involved in the hiring process.
C. Interviews. The Borough Clerk or department head will coordinate the
interview process, including the scheduling of applicants, development
of interview questions and standards to measure candidate responses.
All questions must be in accordance with the New Jersey Division on
Civil Rights Guidelines for Pre-Employment Inquiries. Reasonable
accommodations must be made for disabled applicants.
D. Physical examinations. The Borough Clerk may require applicants,
prior to employment, to successfully pass a physical examination
consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act to assure that the
work required by the position will not cause injury to the employee or
co-employees and that the person is fit to meet the requirements of the
position. The Borough Clerk may require periodic physical
examinations to determine the employee's continued ability to perform
the duties of the position. All physical examinations must be performed
by a physician chosen by the Borough at the expense of the Borough. All
medical records of employees and prospective employees are
confidential and are to be maintained by the Borough Clerk separate
from the employee's official personnel file.
E. Job offers. The final decision will be made by the governing body after
all references and other information have been verified. Every effort
shall be made to offer reasonable accommodations pursuant to the
Americans with Disabilities Act. The employment offer must be made in
a letter to the candidate outlining all terms and conditions of the offer.
The letter will also establish a deadline for acceptance.
F. Acceptances and rejections. If the first offer is rejected, the governing
body will decide to hire another candidate or reopen the position. Once
§ 37-61 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 37-61
1:115
§ 37-62. Veteran's preference.
a candidate accepts the employment offer, all other candidates will be
notified in writing that they were not accepted for the position.
G. Record retention. All applications, notes made during interviews and
reference checks, job offers and other documents created during hiring
process must be returned to the Borough Clerk. Documents related to
the successful candidate will be placed in the employee's official
personnel file, except medical records, including physical examinations,
must be maintained in a separate file. All records documents related to
other candidates must be retained for at least one year. Records and
documents created during the hiring process are confidential and must
be retained in a locked cabinet.
A. A veteran's preference is hereby established in the Borough for
veterans and their widows and orphans. Such preference shall apply for
hiring purposes only, and only in Borough government or service, or any
subdivision or agency thereof, for which the salary is paid for from local
tax revenues and for which a test, examination or other means of
evaluation, be it oral or written, is used in determining which applicant
shall be hired or appointed, as the case may be.
B. The following system of preference points shall be used in determining
which applicant shall be hired or appointed, provided that such
applicant is otherwise qualified for the position:
(1) For a veteran residing in the Borough of Kenilworth: five points or
first consideration where no test is given;
(2) For a veteran residing in the Borough of Kenilworth with a serviceconnected
disability and who is capable of meeting the job
qualifications: 10 points for first consideration if a tie exists or first
consideration where no test is given;
(3) For a veteran residing in the Borough of Kenilworth with a nonservice-
connected disability and who is capable of meeting the job
qualifications: seven points or first consideration where no test is
given;
(4) For widows and orphans of veterans residing in the Borough of
Kenilworth, should no veteran apply and/or qualify: five points or
first consideration if no test is given;
(5) Veterans residing in the Borough of Kenilworth shall receive first
consideration over veterans from other communities.
C. Any veteran or veteran's widow or orphan residing in the Borough of
Kenilworth and applying for a job or position within the Borough, for
whom the foregoing provisions shall apply, must declare on the initial
application his or her intention to exercise his or her right to
preference.
§ 37-61 KENILWORTH CODE § 37-63
1:116
§ 37-63. Open Public Meetings Act procedure concerning personnel
matters.30
Discussions by the governing body or any body of the Borough concerning
appointment, termination, terms and conditions of employment,
performance evaluation, promotion or discipline of any current or
prospective officer or employee shall be in closed session unless the
individual requests in writing that the discussion be held in open session.
Such request must be granted. Prior to the discussion by the governing
body or any body of the Borough concerning such matters, the Clerk shall
notify the affected person(s) of the meeting date, time and place, the
matters to be discussed and the person's right to request that the discussion
occur in open session. In the event more than one person is affected by
the discussion and one of the affected persons does not request that the
discussion be in open session, then the discussion shall be in closed session.
If the individual(s) does not request that the discussion be held in open
session, the governing body or other body of the Borough may at its sole
discretion invite the affected individual(s) to attend the applicable portion
of the closed session.
§ 37-64. Processing and orientation of new employees.
All new regular full-time and regular part-time employees will be scheduled
to meet with the Borough Clerk and department head on their first day
for a general orientation. Copies of all forms and acknowledgments must
be returned to the Borough Clerk for inclusion in the employee's official
personnel file. The orientation will include:
§ 37-65. Initial employment period.
Except where state requirements direct otherwise, new employees (or
present employees transferring to new positions) will be hired subject to
A. A tour of the appropriate facilities to acquaint the new employee with
overall operations as they relate to the specific position;
B. The completion of all pertinent personnel, payroll, insurance and
pension forms;
C. A review of the employee handbook and acknowledgment of receipt;
D. A review of the Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual if the
employee is a manager or supervisor and acknowledgment of receipt;
E. The employee Complaint Policy letter and acknowledgment;
F. A safety orientation and acknowledgment; and
G. Arrangements for the new employee to complete required PEOSHA
safety training.
30.Editor's Note: For the Open Public Meetings Act, see N.J.S.A. 10:4-6 et seq.
§ 37-63 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 37-65
1:117
an initial employment period of not less than six months or more than
12 months, as determined by the governing body. During this initial
employment period, the new employee or transferee will be provided with
training and guidance from the supervisor. At the end of the initial
employment period, the supervisor will conduct an employee evaluation:
see the Performance Evaluation Procedure.31 New employees may be
discharged at any time during this period if the department head, in
consultation with the Borough Clerk, concludes that the employee is not
progressing or performing satisfactorily. Under appropriate circumstances,
the governing body may extend the initial employment period.
§ 37-66. Employee handbook.
The Borough Clerk, with the assistance of Labor Counsel, shall draft an
employee handbook for the approval of the governing body. A separate
version of the handbook will be drafted for part-time and seasonal
employees as well as for major bargaining groups if appropriate. Once
approved, copies will be distributed, and employees will be required to sign
an acknowledgment of receipt that will be placed in the official personnel
file. The handbook will be revised and redistributed whenever there is a
significant change in personnel practice or every two years.
§ 37-67. Performance evaluation.
A. Periodic evaluations are critical to create a formal record of an
employee's performance over time and establish a foundation for
personnel actions such as promotion and termination. In addition to
day-to-day feedback to the employee, a performance evaluation must be
conducted for all employees at least annually and no later than April 30
of each year. The completed appraisal becomes part of an employee's
permanent record. This is a legal document that is discoverable in
lawsuits.
B. Performance discussions must also provide employees with guidance
regarding their ability to meet job standards. Extraordinary skills or
abilities should be recognized in addition to areas for improvement.
Supervisors or department heads should review future training needs
and career planning. The reviewer should also encourage the employee
to make suggestions about how the department can improve. The
reviewer should ask employees for feedback regarding the employee's
skills as they relate to communication, team building, delegation, and
sensitivity to needs of subordinates. Open communication is the key to
improvement.
(1) Setting the stage. The reviewer must create a productive climate
for the discussion. In preparing the evaluation form, prior
evaluations should be reviewed to identify trends. Employees must
be notified in advance of the meeting and should be given a copy of
31.Editor's Note: See § 37-67.
§ 37-65 KENILWORTH CODE § 37-67
1:118
the blank evaluation form. The meeting should be private, without
interruptions, in a comfortable environment.
(2) Confirm expectations. The reviewer should start the discussion of
each performance area by reviewing expectations. Ask the
employee to confirm the employee's understanding of job
requirements. Refer to the job description as appropriate.
(3) Rating. Continue the discussion by giving the employee's rating in
each performance area. The supervisor should be prepared to refer
to documentation. Employees should be evaluated based on set
standards, not as they compare to other employees. It is rare that
any person's rating in all areas is either high or low. The evaluation
should consider performance during the entire period, not just the
recent past. Care should be taken to avoid allowing one aspect of a
person's performance to overshadow all other performance factors,
be it positive or negative. Ideally, each performance area should be
evaluated individually based on specific behaviors exhibited.
(4) Discussing future plans. This is where the reviewer should turn to
the discussion to the future performance and development of the
employee. A counseling action plan form must be completed if any
item is rated "needs improvement" or "does not meet minimum
standards." Specific performance goals must be established for the
next review period, along with plans for achieving those goals.
(5) Closing the discussion. When all performance areas have been
discussed, close the discussion by summarizing all of ratings in an
overall rating for the review period.
(a) "Outstanding" means exceptional performance in all areas of
responsibility. Planned objectives were achieved well above the
established standards, and accomplishments were made in
unexpected areas.
(b) "Exceeds expectations" means consistently exceeds
established standards in most areas of responsibility. All
requirements must be met and objectives achieved above the
established standards.
(c) "Meets job requirements" means all job requirements were
met and planned objectives accomplished within established
standards. There were no critical areas where
accomplishments were less than planned.
(d) "Needs improvement" means performance in one or more
critical areas does not meet expectations. Not all planned
objectives were accomplished within the established
standards, and some responsibilities were not completely met.
§ 37-67 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 37-67
1:119
§ 37-68. Disciplinary action.
(e) "Does not meet minimum standards" means performance is
unacceptable and important objectives have not been
accomplished. Needs immediate improvement.
C. After completing the evaluation, the reviewer will return the form(s)
with the signed acknowledgment to the Borough Clerk for inclusion in
the employee's official personnel file.
A. All employees are expected to meet the Borough's work performance
standards. The intent of the Disciplinary Action Procedure is to formally
document problems and provide the employee with a reasonable time
to improve performance. The process should encourage development
by providing employees with guidance in areas that need improvement
such as poor work performance, attendance problems, personal
conduct, general compliance with the Borough's policies and
procedures and other disciplinary problems.
B. Should a supervisor believe that an employee is not conforming to the
Borough's policies and rules or to specific instructions or has acted
improperly, the supervisor will first privately discuss the matter with
the employee to obtain the employee's view. If the supervisor
determines that the employee has acted improperly, the supervisor
shall take one of the following actions depending upon the gravity and
the employee's past record:
(1) Verbal reprimand. Depending on the circumstances, the supervisor
may verbally notify the employee that the employee's actions have
been improper and warn the employee against further occurrences.
The supervisor will prepare a record of the verbal reprimand,
including the date, time and what was discussed with the
employee. This record must be forwarded to the Borough Clerk for
the employee's official personnel file.
(2) Written reprimand. When a supervisor determines that a written
reprimand is appropriate, the reprimand should clearly identify the
problem and outline a course of corrective action within a specific
time frame. The employee should clearly understand both the
corrective action and the consequence (i.e., termination) if the
problem is not corrected or reoccurs. The employee should
acknowledge receipt of the warning and may include additional
comments. A copy of the written reprimand with the signed
acknowledgment and comments must be forwarded to the Borough
Clerk for the employee's official personnel file.
(3) Suspension. Whenever an employee is recommended for
suspension, the governing body's liaison to the appropriate
Borough department must approve the decision. Suspended
employees may request a hearing under the applicable grievance
procedure.
§ 37-67 KENILWORTH CODE § 37-68
1:120
§ 37-69. Personnel file.
(4) Dismissal. Whenever an employee is recommended for dismissal,
the governing body will make the decision only after seeking the
advice of the Borough's Labor Counsel. There must be a complete
review of the employee's personnel file and all other facts to
determine if there is sufficient cause for the dismissal. Terminated
employees may request a hearing under the applicable grievance
procedure.
A. The official personnel files shall be maintained by the Borough Clerk,
and employee medical information will be maintained in a separate file.
At least annually, the Borough Clerk will review files to make sure they
are up-to-date and will follow up with the department heads as
necessary.
B. The official file shall include at least the following:
(1) The original application signed by the employee;
(2) Notes from any pre-employment interview and reference check;
(3) The original letter detailing an offer of employment and any
additional correspondence concerning the employee's hiring;
(4) A signed acknowledgment that the employee received a copy of the
employee Complaint Policy letter;
(5) A signed acknowledgment that the employee has received the
employee handbook;
(6) A signed acknowledgment that the employee received the safety
orientation;
(7) Annual written performance evaluations, including documentation
that the evaluation was reviewed with the employee;
(8) Counseling action plans;
(9) Records relating to on-the-job accidents;
(10) Disciplinary actions, including an acknowledgment that the
employee was notified of the proposed disciplinary action and was
given an opportunity to respond;
(11) Records relating to any other employment actions, including
promotions, demotions, transfers, resignations, leaves, etc.;
(12) Educational transcripts; and
(13) Any other pertinent information.
§ 37-68 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 37-70
1:121
§ 37-70. Employee complaint investigation.
Employees have the right to formally or informally report any statement,
act, or behavior by a co-employee, supervisor, elected official or visitor that
they believe to be improper.
A. Reporting. Employees should be asked to report complaints in writing
utilizing the employee complaint form, but are not compelled to do so.
B. Identification/screening. The employee shall present the complaint to
his or her supervisor/department head, who must report all written or
verbal complaints to the Borough Clerk, unless the complaint is against
the Borough Clerk, in which event such complaint shall be reported to
the Chief Financial Officer. Upon receipt of the complaint, the
supervisor/department head will determine if the complaint was made
pursuant to the General Anti-Harassment Policy,32 the Anti-Sexual
Harassment Policy,33 the Whistle-Blower Policy,34 a grievance procedure
or is another form of complaint. A file will be established, including the
written complaint, the investigation procedure followed and the
response action plan. As soon as possible but no later than 10 days after
receiving the complaint, the supervisor/department head will interview
the employee. If the employee is reluctant to sign a written complaint,
the investigator will prepare written notes of the date, time and place of
the complaint and the specific allegations. These notes will be read
back to the employee who will be asked to affirm, preferably in writing
the information's accuracy. In the event a complaint is against the
employee's supervisor/department head, the complaint shall be filed
with the Borough Clerk, who shall refer the complaint to the governing
body's Personnel Committee for investigation and resolution in
accordance with this policy. [Amended at time of adoption of Code
(see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
C. Investigation. The investigating person/entity will seek the advice of the
Borough Labor Counsel when planning the investigation. The
investigation should establish the frequency and nature of the alleged
conduct and whether the complaint coincides with other employment
events such as a poor performance evaluation. The investigation should
also determine if other employees were subjected to similar
misconduct. It is important to protect the rights of both the person
making the complaint and the alleged wrongdoer.
D. Response plan: no corrective action required. The investigating person/
entity will discuss the conclusions with the Borough Labor Counsel and
render a decision within 14 days after the investigation is complete. If
the validity of a complaint cannot be determined or the complaint is
groundless, the complaining employee should be notified in writing.
Care should be taken to avoid being too specific, confrontational or

accusatory and to avoid any language that might be construed as
defamatory. A general statement is usually more appropriate that the
claim was thoroughly investigated but could not be sufficiently
documented or confirmed to justify taking formal action. The employee
should be assured that future complaints will be investigated and that
the Borough is committed to eliminating wrongful employment
practices when they are found to exist. If the investigation reveals
that the complainant intentionally and maliciously levied false charges
against the alleged wrongdoer, the complainant must be notified of the
seriousness of filing a false complaint and the appropriate disciplinary
penalty under the circumstances, up to and including termination.
E. Response plan: corrective action required. If the investigation reveals
that the complaint is justified and substantiated, the investigating
person/entity shall refer the matter to the governing body, which will
formulate a corrective action plan as well as possible disciplinary
action, with the advice of Borough Labor Counsel. The complaining
employee will be notified, in writing, that it appears that the complaint
was justified and an appropriate response plan has been formulated. A
copy of the response plan should be attached to the letter. The response
plan should provide for appropriate remedial action to prevent a
recurrence of the wrongful act or behavior.
A. Inquiries and written requests for references or employment
verification regarding a current or former employee must be referred to
the Borough Clerk. No employee may issue a reference letter without
the permission of the Borough Clerk. Under no circumstances should
any information be released over the phone.
B. In response to a request for information, the Borough Clerk will only
verify an employee's name, dates of employment, job title, department
and final salary. No other data or information will be furnished unless:
(1) The Borough is required to release the information by law; or
(2) The employee or former employee authorizes the Borough in
writing to furnish this information and releases the Borough from
liability.
A. The Borough will arrange for employment practices seminars at least
annually to train all managerial/supervisory personnel. The Borough
will also offer nonmandatory training to all other employees, with
special emphasis on employee rights and protections under various
federal and state laws as well as Borough employment practices.
Records will be maintained in the official personnel files of all
employees trained under this procedure.
§ 37-70 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 37-72
1:123
B. Managerial and supervisory personnel will also update employees
periodically by department meetings and memos that should address
specific problems and concerns that may arise. Every effort will be
made to encourage employee suggestions about ways to avoid
employer-employee disputes and violations of employment rights.

applicable, shall inspect the film, picture or moving-picture film, and
the applicant shall reasonably be notified, either by telephone or
written notice left at the location of the device, of the time and place
appointed for such inspection. The failure of the applicant to cooperate

not relieve said applicant of the duty to submit the film, picture or
moving-picture film for inspection.
A. In the case of a submittal to the Chief of Police, he shall, within 24
hours, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excepted, of the termination of
said inspection, either inform the applicant, in writing, that the item
submitted is not obscene and may, therefore, be displayed without fear
of prosecution under this chapter or inform the applicant that he has
referred it to the Review Committee for inspection.
B. Within 72 hours of any submittal or referral to the Review Committee,
the applicant shall either be informed, in writing, that the film, picture
or moving-picture film is not obscene and, therefore, may be displayed
without fear of prosecution under this chapter or so inform the
applicant that the Borough of Kenilworth has brought suit seeking to
have the display of the film, picture or moving-picture film enjoined
because of its obscene character. It shall be a violation of this chapter to
display same during the time period of investigation. Nothing herein
shall prevent the applicant from displaying said film, picture or movingpicture
film after the end of the time periods specified for investigation,
subject, however, to any judicial restraints imposed. If for any reason
the Chief of Police is unavailable to perform his function under this
chapter, he may appoint another person in his stead.

§ 98-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has, in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry.
§ 98-2. Findings of fact.
§ 98-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
A. The flood hazard areas of the Borough of Kenilworth are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected
from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. To protect human life and health;
B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control
projects;
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
§ 97-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 98-3
1:247
§ 98-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
§ 98-5. Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. As used in this
chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
APPEAL  A request for a review of the Construction Official's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO or AH Zone on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map with a one-percent or greater
chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood-blight areas;
G. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
§ 98-3 KENILWORTH CODE § 98-5

building in an area of special flood hazard, to have the top of the elevated
floor elevated above the ground level by means of piling, columns (posts
and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water and adequately
anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during
a flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. In an area of special flood
hazard, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill
or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movement of floodwaters.

include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings or piers, or foundations or the erection
of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property
of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling
units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the
actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling,

whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which exceeds
50% of the market value of the structure before the start of construction
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include either:
§ 98-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 98-5
1:251
VARIANCE  A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which
permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this
chapter.

A. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare
occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the area of special
flood hazard or uses permitted within such area will be free from
flooding or flood damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough, any
officer or employee thereof or the Federal Insurance Administration for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
A. Establishment of development permit.
(1) A development permit shall be obtained before construction or
development begins within any area of special flood hazard
established in § 98-6B. Application for a development permit shall
be made on forms furnished by the local administrator and may
include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale
showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the
area in question; existing or proposed structures; fill; storage of
materials; drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing.
(2) Specifically, the following information is required:
(a) Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all structures;

has been floodproofed;
(c) Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential
structure meet the floodproofing criteria in § 98-14B(2);
(d) Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
B. Designation of the local administrator. The Construction Official is
hereby appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting
or denying development permit applications in accordance with its
provisions.
C. Duties and responsibilities of the administrator. Duties of the local
administrator shall include, but not be limited to:
(1) Permit review. The local administrator shall:
(a) Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
(b) Review all development permits to determine that all
necessary permits have been obtained from those federal,
state or local governmental agencies from which prior
approval is required.
(c) Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located in the floodway and assure that the
encroachment provisions of § 98-14B(4) are met.
(2) Use of other base flood and floodway data. When base flood
elevation and floodway data has not been provided in accordance
with § 98-6B, Basis for establishing the areas of special flood
hazard, the Construction Code Official shall obtain, review, and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, in order to
administer § 98-14B(1), Specific standards, Residential
construction, and § 98-14B(2), Specific standards, Nonresidential
construction.
(3) Information to be obtained and maintained. The local administrator
shall:
(a) Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or
substantially improved structures, and whether or not the
structure contains a basement.

§ 98-11 KENILWORTH CODE § 98-11
1:254
§ 98-12. Appeals and variances.
[1] Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean
sea level); and
[2] Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in
§ 98-11A(2)(c).
(c) Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter.
(4) Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
(a) Notify adjacent communities and the New Jersey Department
of Environmental Protection, Dam Safety and Flood Control
Section, and the Land Use Regulation Program prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence
of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration.
(b) Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so the flood-carrying
capacity is not diminished.
(5) Interpretation of FIRM boundaries. Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of
special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a
conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions).
The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
§ 98-12.
A. The Appeal Board as established by the Borough of Kenilworth shall
hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.

(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(10) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
(11) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems, and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of § 98-12D and the purposes of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
F. The Construction Official shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions, including technical information, and report any variances to
the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that items in
§ 98-12D(1) through (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as
a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
§ 98-12 KENILWORTH CODE § 98-13
1:256
§ 98-14. Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
C. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public as identified in § 98-12D, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
F. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
A. General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following
standards are required:
(1) Anchoring.
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of
the structure.
(b) All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting
wind forces.
(2) Construction materials and methods.
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to
flood damage.
(b) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood
damage.
(3) Utilities.
§ 98-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 98-14
1:257
(a) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the system;

within the components during conditions of flooding.
(4) Subdivision proposals.
(a) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
(b) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems
located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
(c) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; and
(d) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development which contain at

improvements having fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor
that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must
meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
(a) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided.

elevation data has been provided as set forth in § 98-6B, Basis for
establishing the areas of special flood hazard, or in § 98-11C(2), Use of
other base flood and floodway data, the following standards are
required:
(1) Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall:
(a) Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
base flood elevation.
(b) Require within any AO Zone on the municipality's FIRM that all
new construction and substantial improvement of any
residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least
as high as the depth number specified in feet (at least two feet
if no depth number is specified), and require adequate
drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(2) Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential
structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to the level of the base flood elevation or, together with

from proposed structures; or
(b) Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water, have structural components capable of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy, and be certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice for meeting the applicable provisions of this
subsection. Such certification shall be provided to the official
as set forth in § 98-11C(3).

collect their recyclables in a single stream or dual stream (fiber,
commingled), provided the material recovery facility (MRF) that
receives the material has certified that it has the ability to separate
and maximize the capture rate of the designated recyclables. The
UCUA Division of Solid Waste Enforcement will compile and
maintain an updated list of those facilities. [Amended at time of
adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
A. The owner/operator (or in case of construction, the contractor) is

§ 120-4.10. Voting procedures.
The following voting procedures shall apply for public hearings held
pursuant to this chapter. Nothing herein shall be construed to contravene
any act providing for procedures for governing bodies.
§ 120-4.11. Decisions.
A. All actions shall be taken by a majority vote of the members present at
the hearing. In the case of a use variance pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55-70d, affirmative votes are required by at least five members.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. II)]
B. A member of the Board who was absent for one or more of the meetings
at which a hearing was held or was not a member of the Board at that
time shall be eligible to vote on the matter upon which the hearing was
conducted if such member has available to him/her the transcript or
recording of all of the hearings from which he/she was absent or was

such transcript or listened to such recording. [Amended at time of
adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
C. Failure of a motion to receive the number of votes required to approve

fact and conclusions based thereon in each decision on any application
for development and shall reduce the decision to writing. Failure of a
motion to receive the number of votes required to approve an
application for development pursuant to the exceptional vote
requirements of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-34 or § 120-4.10A shall be deemed an
action denying the application. The Board shall provide the findings and
conclusions through:
(1) A resolution adopted at a meeting held within the time period
provided in N.J.S.A. 40:55D for action by the Board on the
application for development; or
(2) A memorializing resolution adopted at a meeting held not later
than 45 days after the date of the meeting at which the Board voted
to grant or deny approval. Only the members of the Board who
voted for the action taken may vote on the memorializing
resolution, and the vote of a majority of such members present at
the meeting at which the resolution is presented for adoption shall
be sufficient to adopt the resolution. An action pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-9, resulting from the failure of a motion to approve an
application, shall be memorialized by resolution as provided above,
with those members voting against the motion for approval being
§ 120-4.10 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-4.11
1:374
§ 120-4.12. Record of decisions.
The Board shall include findings of fact and conclusions based thereon
in each decision on any application for development and shall reduce the
decision to writing. The Board shall provide the findings and conclusions
through either resolution adopted at a meeting held within the time period
provided in the Act89 for action by the Board on the application for
development or a memorializing resolution adopted at a meeting held not
later than 45 days after the date of the meeting at which the Board voted
the members eligible to vote on the memorializing resolution. The
vote on any such resolution shall be deemed to be a
memorialization of the action of the Board and not to be an action
of the Board. However, the date of the adoption of the resolution
shall constitute the date of the decision for purposes of the
mailings, filings and publication required by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-10h
and i.
B. Conditional decisions; County Planning Board approval. Where
required by law, N.J.S.A. 40:27-6.6, the application shall be submitted to
the County Planning Board for review or approval, and in such cases,
the Borough Planning Board shall condition any approval that it grants
upon timely receipt of a favorable report from the County Planning
Board or upon the County Planning Board's failure to report within the
required time period. Decisions may also be conditioned on approval by
other governmental agencies.
C. Mailing. A copy of the decision shall be mailed by the Board within 10
days of the date of decision to the applicant or, if represented, then to
his/her attorney, without separate charge. A copy of the decision shall
also be mailed to all persons who request it and who have paid the
prescribed fee. A copy of the decision shall also be filed in the office of
the administrative officer, who shall make a copy of such filed decision
available for public inspection during his/her office hours and a copy
available to any interested party upon payment of a fee, calculated in
the same manner as those established for copies of the other public
documents in the Borough.
D. Publication. A brief notice of every final decision on an application for a
variance or development shall be published in the official newspaper of
the Borough. Such publication shall be arranged by and be the
responsibility of the applicant. Notice shall be sent to the official
newspaper for publication within 10 days of the date of any such
decision. The applicant shall file an affidavit of publication with the
Planning Board on the application for development. [Amended at time
of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]

may be made shall run from the date of publication of the decision.

to grant or deny approval. The following provisions shall apply to
memorializing resolutions:
§ 120-4.13. Mailing, filing and publication of decisions.
Following adoption of a resolution on a development application by the
Board, the resolution shall be mailed, filed and published as follows:
A. Only the members of the Board who voted for the action taken may vote
on the memorializing resolution, and the vote of a majority of such
members present at the meeting at which the resolution is presented
for adoption shall be sufficient to adopt the resolution. If only one
member who voted for the action attends the meeting at which the
resolution is presented for adoption, the resolution may be adopted
upon the vote of that member.
B. An action to deny, resulting from the failure of a motion to approve an
application, shall be memorialized by resolution as provided above,
with those members voting against the motion for approval being the
members eligible to vote on the memorializing resolution.
C. The vote of any memorializing resolution shall be deemed to be a
memorialization of the action of the Board; however, the date of the
adoption of the resolution shall constitute the date of the decision for
purposes of the mailings, filings and publications required by this Part
1.
D. If the Board fails to adopt a resolution or memorializing resolution as
hereinabove specified, any interested party may apply to the Superior
Court in a summary manner for an order compelling the Board to
reduce its findings and conclusions to writing within a stated time, and
the cost of the application, including attorney's fees, shall be assessed
against the Borough.
A. A copy of the decision shall be mailed by the Board within 10 days of the
date of decision to the applicant, or if represented to his attorney,
without separate charge. A copy of the decision shall also be mailed to
all persons who have requested it and who paid the fee prescribed by
the Board for such service.
B. A copy of the decision shall also be filed in the office of the Borough
Clerk, who shall make a copy of such filed decision available to any
interested party upon payment of a fee calculated in the same manner
as those established for copies of other public documents in the
municipality.

newspaper of the Borough. Such publication shall be arranged by the

ARTICLE 5
Procedures for Variance Applications, Appeals, Requests for
Interpretations or Other Special Questions
§ 120-5.1. Applications for variances or for issuance of certain
permits.
A. General. It is the intent of this section to set forth the procedures for
applications to the Board for variances and for the direction of the
issuance of certain permits as permitted by this chapter. In addition to
the procedures set forth in the following subsections for each type of
application, the procedures set forth for processing and review of site
plan and subdivision applications in this chapter shall apply, unless the
context clearly indicates otherwise or unless contrary to law, including
but not necessarily limited to the following:
(1) The filing procedures in Article 5;
(2) The procedures for filing simultaneous applications in this Part 1;
(3) The completeness review procedures in Articles 4 and 5;
(4) The general review procedures in Article 5;
(5) The conditional approval provisions in this Part 1;
(6) The provisions for extensions and tolling of approvals in this Part 1;
and
(7) The provisions for reservation of public areas, payment of taxes and
assessments, disclosure of ownership and binding nature of
approvals in Articles 5 and 6.
B. Review of existing nonconforming conditions in connection with
applications for variances or for the direction of the issuance of certain
permits. In reviewing applications for variances or for the direction of
the issuance of certain permits, the Board shall determine whether any
existing nonconforming conditions involving the subject property will
exacerbate, intensify, alter, affect or in some way result in a significant
impact on the proposed use, structure or land. If the Board finds that no
substantial impact or detriment will result, the Board shall so state in
its findings of fact in the resolution for the application, without the need
for such existing nonconforming conditions to meet the criteria
established by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-34, 40:55D-36, 40:55D-51a and b and
40:55D-70c and d and this chapter for variances or exceptions. If the
Board finds that substantial impacts or detriments will result, however,
the application shall not be approved unless and until the applicant
agrees to mitigate or eliminate such impacts or detriments to the
maximum extent feasible. The above shall not be construed to alter the
review procedures nor the criteria for granting variances or exceptions
for violations proposed by the development or existing illegally on the
subject property.
§ 120-5.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-5.1
1:379
C. "C" variance applications. Subject to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1
et seq., applications to the Board may be taken for relief from the
zoning regulations, Articles 20 through 33 of this chapter. The following
provisions shall apply to "C" variance applications:
(1) When subdivision, site plan or conditional use approval is required,
the developer may elect to submit a separate application with the
Board requesting approval of the variance and a subsequent
application for any such other required approval. Any separate
approval of the variance shall be conditioned upon the granting of
all required subsequent approvals by the Board.
(2) Any application pursuant to this section shall be required to submit
the information required by this chapter and shall be reviewed for
completeness in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Articles 4 and 5.
(3) A public hearing shall be held in accordance with the provisions for
hearings in Article 4.
(4) The applicant shall give public notice of the hearing in the manner
specified for development applications in Articles 4 and 5.
Affidavits of proof of service of notice shall be submitted at least
seven business days prior to the hearing.
(5) There must be a showing by the applicant and the Board must find
all of the following:
(a) By reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a
specific piece of property, or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions or physical features uniquely affecting
a specific piece of property, or by reason of an extraordinary
and exceptional situation uniquely affecting a specific piece of
property or the structures lawfully existing thereon, the strict
application of any regulation pursuant to Part 3 of this chapter
would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties
to, or exceptional and undue hardship upon, the developer of
such property; [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see
Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
(b) In an application or appeal relating to a specific piece of
property, the purposes of this chapter would be advanced by a
deviation from the requirements of Part 3, Zoning, and the
benefits of the deviation would substantially outweigh any
detriment; provided, however, that the fact that a proposed use
is an inherently beneficial use shall not be dispositive of a
decision on a variance under this subsection, and provided that
no variance from those departures enumerated in § 120-2.7D
shall be granted under this subsection; and provided further
that the proposed development does not require approval by
the Board of a subdivision, site plan or conditional use, in
§ 120-5.1 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-5.1
1:380
conjunction with which the Board has power to review a
request for a variance pursuant to this Part 1; [Amended at
time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions,
Art. II)]
(c) The variance can be granted without substantial detriment to
the public good; and
(d) The grant of the variance will not substantially impair the
intent of the zone plan and zoning regulations.
(6) The Board shall render a decision not later than 120 days after the
date the application is certified to be complete pursuant to Article
5, or within such further time as may be consented to by the
applicant.
(7) The Board may refer an application pursuant to this section to any
appropriate person or agency for its report, provided that such
reference shall not extend the period of time within which the
Board shall act.
D. "D" variance applications. Subject to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1
et seq., and in particular cases, applications to the Board may be taken
for relief from the zoning regulations, Articles 20 through 33 of this
chapter, involving "D" variance requests. A developer may file an
application for a "D" variance with the Board without prior application
to the Zoning Officer or Construction Official. The following provisions
shall apply to "D" variance applications:
(1) Any application pursuant to this subsection shall be required to
submit the information required by Articles 4 and 5, and shall be
reviewed for completeness in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Articles 4 and 5.
(2) A public hearing shall be held in accordance with the provisions for
hearings in Article 4.
(3) The applicant shall give public notice of the hearing in the manner
specified for development applications in Article 4 and 5. Affidavits

business days prior to the hearing.
(4) In particular cases, for special reasons, the Board may grant a
variance to allow departure from regulations pursuant to Articles
20 through 33 of this chapter to permit:
(a) A use or principal structure in a district restricted against such
use or principal structure;
(b) An expansion of a nonconforming use;
(c) Deviation from a specification or standard pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-67 pertaining solely to a conditional use;
§ 120-5.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-5.1
1:381
(d) An increase in the permitted floor area ratio as defined in
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-4;
(e) An increase in the permitted density as defined in N.J.S.A.
40:55D-4, except as applied to the required lot area for a lot or
lots for detached one- or two-dwelling-unit buildings, which lot
or lots are either an isolated undersized lot or lots resulting
from a minor subdivision; or
(f) A height of a principal structure which exceeds by 10 feet or
10% the maximum height permitted in the zone for a principal
structure.
(5) A variance under this subsection shall be granted only by
affirmative vote of at least five members.
(6) If an applicant requests one or more variances but not a variance
for a purpose enumerated in this Part 1, the decision on the
requested variance or variances shall be rendered under this Part
1.
(7) No variance or other relief may be granted under the terms of this
Part 1, including a variance or other relief involving an inherently
beneficial use and/or special reasons, without a showing that such
variance or other relief can be granted without substantial
detriment to the public good and will not substantially impair the
intent and the purpose of the zone plan and this chapter.
(8) An application under this Part 1 may be referred to any appropriate
person or agency for its report, provided that such reference shall
not extend the period of time within which the Board shall act.
(9) The Board shall render a decision not later than 120 days after the
date the application is certified to be complete pursuant to Article
5, or within such further time as may be consented to by the
applicant.
E. Application for issuance of permits for areas on Official Map.
Applications to the Board may be taken for relief necessary to issue a
permit for any building or structure in the bed of any street or public
drainage way, flood control basin or public area reserved on the Official
Map. A developer may file an application for development with the
Board under this subsection without prior application to the
Construction Official. The following provisions shall apply to such
applications:
(1) When subdivision, site plan or conditional use approval is required,
the developer may submit an application with the Board requesting
direction for the issuance of a permit and a subsequent application
for any such other required approval. Any such separate direction
for the issuance of a permit shall be conditioned upon the granting
of all required subsequent approvals by the Board.
§ 120-5.1 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-5.1
1:382
(2) Any application pursuant to this subsection shall consist of a
completed application form and a map showing the property in
question and the location of the proposed building and/or structure
in relation to the bed of the mapped street or public drainage way,
flood control basin or public area reserved on the Official Map. The
following number of copies shall be submitted:
(a) One signed original application, and five copies of the map and
the application.

well as proof of payment of taxes and assessments.

proceedings in the same manner as specified in this Part 1.

that the subject property cannot yield a reasonable return to the
owner unless a building permit is granted.
(7) Any decision of the Board to direct the issuance of a permit
pursuant to this subsection shall be by an affirmative vote of a
majority of the full authorized membership of the Board and shall
be in accordance with terms and conditions which will as little as
practicable increase the cost of opening such street, or tend to
cause a minimum change of the Official Map, and the Board shall
impose reasonable requirements as a condition of granting the
permit so as to promote the health, morals, safety and general
welfare of the public.
(8) The Board shall render a decision not later than 120 days after the
date the application is certified to be complete pursuant to this
article or within such further time as may be consented to by the

any appropriate person or agency for his/her/its report, provided
that such reference shall not extend the period of time within which
the Board shall act.
F. Application for permits for lot not abutting a street. Applications to the
Board may be taken for relief necessary to issue a permit for any
building or structure on a lot which does not abut a street giving access
to such building or structure. A developer may file an application for
§ 120-5.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-5.1
1:383
development with the Board under this subsection without prior
application to the Construction Official. The following provisions shall
apply to such applications:
(1) When subdivision, site plan or conditional use approval is required,
the developer may elect to submit an application with the Board

pursuant to this subsection shall be in accordance with terms and

work of the same nature by the professional for the Borough when fees

not appeal each charge individually.
(5) During the pendency of any appeal, the Borough or approving
authority shall continue to process, hear, and decide the application
for development and to inspect the development in the normal
course, and shall not withhold, delay, or deny reviews, inspections,
signing of subdivision plats or site plans, the reduction or the
release of performance and maintenance guarantees, the issuance
of building permits or certificates of occupancy, or any other
approval or permit because an appeal has been filed or is pending

§ 120-6.5. Performance and maintenance guarantees.
B. For those developments for which the reasonably anticipated inspection
fees are less than $10,000, inspection fee deposits may, at the option of
the developer, be paid in two installments. The initial amount deposited
by a developer shall be 50% of the reasonably anticipated inspection
fees. When the balance on deposit drops to 10% of the reasonable
anticipated inspection fees because the amount deposited by the
developer has been reduced by the amount paid to the Borough
Engineer for inspection, the developer shall deposit the remaining 50%
of the anticipated inspection fees.
C. For those developments for which the reasonably anticipated inspection
fees are $10,000 or greater, inspection fee deposits may, at the option of
the developer, be paid in four installments. The initial amount deposited
by a developer shall be 25% of the reasonably anticipated fees. When
the balance on deposit drops to 10% of the reasonably anticipated fees
because the amount deposited by the developer has been reduced by
the amount paid to the Borough Engineer for inspection, the developer
shall make additional deposits of 25% of the reasonably anticipated
fees.
D. Appeals of the amount required to be deposited for the payment of
inspection fees or the amount charged for the inspection of
improvements shall follow the procedures in § 120-6.3I.
A. Before recording of final subdivision plats or as a condition of final site
plan approval or as a condition to the issuance of a zoning approval
pursuant to this chapter, the Board may require and shall accept
performance and maintenance guarantees for the purpose of assuring
the installation and maintenance of on tract improvements. Such
performance and maintenance guarantees shall be in accordance with
the following standards:
(1) Performance guarantees. The following standards shall apply to the
administration of performance guarantees:
(a) Amount of performance guarantee. The performance
guarantee for the installation of those improvements required
shall be in favor of the Borough in an amount equal to 120% of
the cost of such improvements. The cost of said improvements
shall be determined by the Borough Engineer based on
documented construction costs for improvements prevailing in
the general area of the Borough. The Borough Engineer shall
prepare an itemized cost estimate of the improvements
covered by the performance guarantee, which estimate shall
be appended to each performance guarantee posted by the
obligor.
(b) Appeal of disputed performance guarantee amounts. The
developer may appeal the Borough Engineer's estimate of the
§ 120-6.4 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-6.5
1:400
cost of improvements for purposes of furnishing a performance
guarantee. Such appeal shall be made in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Part 3.
(2) Form of guarantee. At least 10% of the performance guarantee
shall be in the form of cash or a certified check made payable to the
Borough. The balance of the performance guarantee shall be in the
form of any security issued by an institution authorized to issue
such securities in the State of New Jersey and which may be
accepted by the Borough and approved by the Borough Attorney,
including but not limited to surety bonds, cash and letters of credit,
provided that the Borough shall only accept an irrevocable letter of
credit if it:
(a) Constitutes an unconditional payment obligation of the issuer
running solely to the Borough for an express initial period of
time of at least one year but not more than two years from the
date of final approval;
(b) Is in the amount determined by the Borough Engineer or the
governing body, as applicable, as provided herein, less the
amount of any other forms of guarantee furnished;
(c) Is issued by a banking or savings institution authorized to do
and doing business in the State of New Jersey; and
(d) Permits the Borough to draw upon the letter of credit if the
obligor fails to furnish another letter of credit which complies
with the provisions of this section 30 days or more in advance
of the expiration date of the letter of credit or such longer
period in advance thereof as is stated in the letter of credit.
(3) Time allowed for completion of improvements. The performance
guarantee shall state the time period within which all
improvements are to be installed by the developer. No performance
guarantee shall run for a term longer than two years, except as
provided otherwise by this chapter.
(4) Extension of time allowed for completion of improvements. The
time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the
performance guarantee has been provided may be extended by the
governing body by resolution. As a condition or as part of any such
extension, the amount of any performance guarantee shall be
increased or reduced, as the case may be, to an amount not to
exceed 120% of the cost of the installation at the time of the
resolution. The cost of the installation shall be determined by the
Borough Engineer as provided herein for the initial cost
determination.
(5) Failure to complete improvements within time specified. If the
required improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guarantee, the obligor and
§ 120-6.5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-6.5
1:401
surety, if any, shall be liable thereon to the Borough for the
reasonable cost of the improvement not completed or corrected.
The Borough may, either prior to or after receipt of the proceeds
thereof, complete such improvements or use said funds to restore
the property to a safe condition so that the subject property in its
unfinished development state does not adversely affect the public
safety or adversely impact the environment. Such completion or
correction of improvements shall be subject to the public bidding
requirements of the Local Public Contracts Law.95
(6) Release of performance guarantee. Release of performance
guarantees shall be in accordance with the following procedure:
(a) Upon substantial completion of all required street
improvements (except for the top course) and appurtenant
utility improvements, and the connection of same to the public
system, the obligor may request of the governing body that the
Borough Engineer prepare a list of all uncompleted or
unsatisfactorily completed improvements. The request to the
Mayor and Council shall be made in writing by certified mail
addressed to the Borough Clerk, with a copy of the request to
be sent to the Borough Engineer. The request shall indicate
which improvements have been completed and which
improvements remain uncompleted in the judgment of the
obligor.
(b) Upon receiving the obligor's request, the Borough Engineer
shall inspect all improvements covered by the obligor's request
and shall file a detailed list and report, in writing, to the
governing body, and shall simultaneously send a copy thereof
to the obligor not later than 45 days after receipt of the
obligor's request.
(c) The detailed list prepared by the Borough Engineer shall be in
accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the
Borough Engineer, which estimate shall have been appended
to the performance guarantee as required herein. The list
prepared by the Borough Engineer shall state, in detail, with
respect to each improvement determined to be incomplete or
unsatisfactory, the nature and extent of the incompleteness of
each incomplete improvement or the nature and extent of, and
remedy for, the unsatisfactory state of each completed
improvement determined to be unsatisfactory.
(d) The report prepared by the Borough Engineer shall identify
each improvement determined to be complete and satisfactory
together with a recommendation as to the amount of reduction
to be made in the performance guarantee relating to the
completed and satisfactory improvement. The recommended

estimate prepared by the Borough Engineer, which cost
estimate shall have been appended to the performance
guarantee as required herein.
(e) The governing body, by resolution, shall either approve the
improvements determined to be complete and satisfactory by
the Borough Engineer or reject any or all of these
improvements. The cause for any rejection shall be stated in
the resolution. If any portion of the required improvements is
rejected, the approving authority may require the obligor to
complete or correct such improvements and, upon completion
or correction, the same procedure of notification as required
herein shall be followed.
(f) For accepted improvements, the governing body shall approve
and authorize the amount of reduction to be made in the
performance guarantee relating to the improvements
accepted. Any authorized reduction shall be in accordance
with itemized cost estimate prepared by the Borough Engineer,
which cost estimate shall have been appended to the
performance guarantee as required herein. The resolution
shall be adopted not later than 45 days after receipt of the list
and report prepared by the Borough Engineer.
(g) Any partial reduction granted in the performance guarantee as
provided shall be applied to the cash deposit in the same
proportion as the original cash deposit bears to the full amount
of the performance guarantee.
(7) Failure of the Borough Engineer or the governing body to act.
(a) If the Borough Engineer or the governing body fails to act on
the request for release of a performance guarantee within the
time required, the obligor may apply to the court in the manner
provided below, provided that nothing herein shall be
construed to limit the right of the obligor to contest by legal
proceedings any determination of the governing body or the
Borough Engineer.
(b) If the Borough Engineer fails to send or provide the list and
report as requested by the obligor as required herein within 45
days from receipt of the request, the obligor may apply to the
court in a summary manner for an order compelling the
Borough Engineer to provide the list and report within a stated
time. The cost of applying to the court, including reasonable
attorney's fees, may be awarded to the prevailing party.
(c) If the governing body fails to approve or reject the
improvements determined by the Borough Engineer to be

ARTICLE 12
Minor Site Plans
§ 120-12.1. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to supplement the site plan review process by
the addition of a category referred to as a "minor site plan." Minor site plans
accommodate inconsequential changes to an existing site, which may be
permitted without a full site plan review in order to facilitate development
within the Borough.
§ 120-12.2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
MINOR SITE PLAN  A development plan of one or more lots which:
§ 120-12.3. Waiver of formal notice and public hearing
requirements. [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1,
General Provisions, Art. II)]
The Planning Board shall waive formal notice and public hearing
requirements for development if the Planning Board finds that the
application for development conforms to the definition of a "minor site plan"
as set forth herein.
Is limited to the following where no new variances are required:
(1) Freestanding sign;
(2) Alteration of a facade of the building;
Increase or decrease in floor area (either gross or habitable) of less
than 500 square feet;
(3)
Addition of a permitted accessory building, structure or use no
larger than 500 square feet in floor area;
(4)
(5) Modification of utilization not involving any of the above; or
Change from one conforming use to another conforming use, or one
office use to another office use, for which there is no other variance
required;
(6)
A.
Does not involve planned development, any new street or extension of
any off-tract improvement which is to be prorated pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-42; and
B.
Contains the information reasonably required in order to make an
informed determination as to whether the requirements established by
this chapter for approval of a minor site plan have been met.
C.
§ 120-12.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-12.4
1:421
§ 120-12.4. Application.
§ 120-12.5. Review of application.
Upon receipt of the requested escrow fees, the minor site plan application
shall be reviewed by one or more of the following Borough officials: Building
Inspector, Zoning Officer, Borough Planner, Borough Engineer, Fire Chief,
Police Chief, and/or Health Officer. Once deemed complete, the application
shall be forwarded to the Planning Board for review and action.
§ 120-12.6. Additional requirements.
Minor site plan applications shall be approved and permits issued subject
to receipt of applicable outside agency approvals and/or permits and the
establishment of applicable performance guarantees and payment of
inspection fees.
§ 120-12.7. Decision by Board. [Amended at time of adoption of
Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
Minor site plan applications shall be granted or denied within 45 days of
the date of submission of a complete application to the Secretary of the
Board or within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant.
Failure of the Planning Board to act within the prescribed time period shall
constitute minor site plan approval. A public hearing is not required for a
minor site plan application.
§ 120-12.8. Final approval. [Amended at time of adoption of Code
(see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
Minor site plan approval shall be deemed to be final approval of the site plan
application by the Planning Board, provided that the Board or subcommittee
may condition such approval on terms ensuring the provision of
improvements pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-38, 40:55D-39, 40:55D-41 and
40:55D-53.
A. An application for approval of a minor site plan shall consist of the
following:
(1) A completed minor site plan application.
(2) A key map of the site plan as originally approved, showing the zone
district in which the property being further developed is located

Borough Council the reduction of the amount of the performance guarantee
up to 70% upon certification, in writing, by the Borough Engineer that
certain portions of the required improvements and Planning Board
conditions have been properly completed and upon the posting of proper
guarantees and maintenance bonds, provided that the remaining
performance guarantees and maintenance bonds are adequate to insure
completion of the remaining improvements.
A. Performance guarantees shall be provided in accordance with this
chapter.
B. In addition, 10% thereof shall be deposited in cash or by certified check
with the Borough Clerk, conditioned upon the developer providing
streetlighting, sidewalks, shade trees, surveyors monuments, iron pipe
lot markers and such other subdivision improvements as the Borough
Council and Board may find necessary or appropriate in the public
interest. The deposit, or a portion thereof, in an amount as certified in
writing by the Borough Engineer and approved by the Council, may be
expended by the Borough if, within 30 days after written notice from
the Borough Engineer, the developer shall fail to provide a stated
improvement of a type necessary or appropriate for the public interest.

C. Clear view at intersections.
(1) No fence, structure, planting or shrubbery over 30 inches in height
above the level of the pavement at the center of the street, opposite
the point in question, shall be erected, planted or maintained on
any corner lot, in any zone, within 25 feet of the intersection
formed by the projection of the two street side lines at the corner.
(2) No fence, structure, planting or shrubbery shall be permitted
within three feet of any street side line, on any lot, in any zone. The
branches of all trees and shrubs projecting beyond such street side
line must be trimmed at all times in order to ensure unobstructed
vision and clearance eight feet above the ground or sidewalk level.
D. Topsoil protection. No topsoil shall be removed from the site or used as
spoil unless permission is first obtained from the Borough Engineer and
the Planning Board. Topsoil moved during the course of construction
shall be redistributed so as to provide at least four inches of cover to all
areas of the subdivision and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting.

made by the Borough Engineer prior to final approval. (See also Article 6,
Fees, Deposits, Guarantees and Other Payments.)
§ 120-16.3. Completion of required improvements; performance
guarantee; maintenance bond.
and the Planning Board. All changes in elevation and contours approved
by the Borough Engineer and the Planning Board shall be shown on the
preliminary and final plat and profiles.
H. Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be installed in locations approved by
the Fire Department.
I. Construction stakes and grades. All construction stakes and grades
thereon shall be set by a licensed land surveyor in the employ of the
developer or his/her contractor, and a duplicate copy of the notes made
therefrom shall be filed with the Borough Engineer.
J. Commencement of site work. No site work shall commence without the
Borough Engineer being properly notified. Such notice shall be given at
least one week before the commencement of work.
K. Debris. All stumps, litter, rubbish, brush, weeds, dead and dying trees,
roots and debris shall be removed from the site to the satisfaction of the
Borough Engineer. None of the above shall be buried or covered.
L. Construction standards and specifications. The construction standards
and specifications of the Borough, as now or hereafter adopted, shall
govern the construction and installation of all of the above

§ 120-16.1 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-16.3
1:438
A. No final plat shall be approved by the Planning Board until the
completion of all required improvements specified in this Part 2 have
been certified to the Planning Board by the Borough Engineer. In
addition, no final plat shall be approved by the Planning Board unless
the developer or owner shall have filed with the Borough Clerk a
performance guarantee sufficient in amount to cover the cost of all
improvements or uncompleted portions thereof, specified in this Part 2,
as estimated by the Borough Engineer, and assuring the installation of
such uncompleted improvements on or before an agreed date, not to
exceed three years from the date of execution of the performance
guarantee. An additional amount of 20% of the estimate of the Borough
Engineer shall be included in the total amount of the performance
guarantee to cover legal, engineering and other costs in the event that
the developer shall fail to complete the required improvements and the
Borough is required to install the improvements. Such performance
guarantee may be in the form of an irrevocable performance bond,
which shall be issued by a bonding or surety company and approved by
the Borough Council and by the Borough Attorney as to form,
sufficiency and execution; or a certified check in the sum specified by
the Borough Engineer, which check shall be deposited to the trust
account for the Borough or a bank account with the bank book in
Borough custody. Such money or other surety shall be returned to the
depositor after full compliance. The Borough may require up to 10% of
the performance guarantee to be deposited in cash.
B. The performance guarantee shall run for a period to be fixed by the
Planning Board, but in no case for a term of more than three years.
However, with the consent of the owner and the surety, if there is one,
the Borough Council, by resolution, may extend the term of such
performance guarantee for an additional period, not to exceed three
years. The amount of a performance guarantee may be reduced by the
Council by resolution when portions of the required improvements have
been installed and accepted for maintenance.
C. If the required improvements have not been installed in accordance
with the performance guarantee, the obligor and surety shall be liable
thereon to the Borough for the reasonable cost of the improvements not
installed or improperly installed and the expenses involved thereto.
Upon receipt of the proceeds of the bond or guarantee, the Borough
shall install such improvements or shall correct any such defective
installations. The Borough may use such portions of the performance
guarantee as have been deposited in cash with the Borough Clerk in
accordance with the terms of this Part 2 and any applicable agreement
to assure the completion or correction of such improvements.
D. Upon completion and approval of a portion or section, the developer
shall be required to file a maintenance bond sufficient in amount to
guarantee that the completed section will be maintained by the
developer until completion of improvements in the remaining portions
§ 120-16.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-16.3
1:439
§ 120-16.4. Off-tract improvements.
Pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-39 and 40:55D-42,
construction of, or contributions for, off-tract water, sewer, drainage and
street improvements may be required in accordance with the following
criteria:
or sections of the subdivision and for a stated period of time thereafter,
not to exceed three years from date of completion of all improvements.
E. The Borough Engineer shall determine the amount of the maintenance
bond, and it shall be approved by the Borough Attorney as to form and
sufficiency.
A. Improvements at sole expense of applicant. In cases where reasonable
and necessary need for an off-tract improvement or improvements is
necessitated or required by the proposed development application, and
where no other property owners receive a special benefit thereby, the
Board may require the applicant, as a condition of subdivision or site
plan approval, at the applicant's sole expense, to provide for and
construct such improvements as if such were on-tract improvements, in
the manner provided hereafter and as otherwise provided by law.
B. Contributions by developer.
(1) In cases where the need for any off-tract improvement is
necessitated by the proposed development application, and where
the Board determines, in writing, that properties outside the
development will also be benefited by the improvements, the Board
shall require such contribution from the developer towards the cost
of such improvement or improvements as the Board determines is
fair and equitable, considering the benefit to the development and
the creation in acceleration of the need by the development. The
resolution or determination of the Board shall specify the off-tract
improvements which are necessary and the terms and conditions
which shall be imposed upon the applicant to insure the successful
and reasonable implementation of same. In its deliberation as to
whether off-tract improvements are required, the Board shall be
guided by the rules and regulations specified in Part 3, Zoning, this
Part 2 and the Borough Master Plan. The Board may also be guided
by counsel from the Board Attorney, Engineer and other qualified
experts and Borough officials.
(2) In the event that the Board determines that one or more
improvements constitute an off-tract improvement, the Board shall
notify the Borough Council of same, specifying the Board's
recommendation relative to the estimated cost, the applicant's
prorated share of the cost and possible methods or means to
implement same, including, but not limited to, performance and
maintenance guarantees, cash contributions, development
agreements and other forms of surety.
§ 120-16.3 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-16.4
1:440
(3) The Board shall not grant final approval of the subdivision until all
aspects of such conditions have been mutually agreed to by both
the applicant and the Borough Council, and a written resolution to
that effect by the Council has been transmitted to the Board.
C. Methods of implementation.
(1) Performance and maintenance guarantees. Where a performance
or maintenance guarantee or other surety is required in connection
with an off-tract improvement, the applicant shall be required to
follow the same procedures and requirements as specified in this
Part 2 for other improvements.
(2) Development agreement. A development agreement governing offtract
improvements or other conditions as may be required by this
Part 2 or by the Board shall be approved as to form, sufficiency and
execution by the Board Attorney and Borough Attorney. Such
agreement shall specify the amount of cash contributions, if any,
the method of payment of same, the relative timing of such
payment and the obligation or obligations to be undertaken by the
Borough.
(3) Cash contributions; exceptions. Cash contributions for off-tract
improvements shall not be required under the following conditions:
(a) Where another county or state agency has jurisdiction over the
subject improvement and requires a cash contribution,
guarantee or other surety of the applicant in lieu of such
conditions imposed by the Borough;
(b) Where a benefit assessment or other similar tax levy is
imposed upon the applicant for the off-site improvement
provided; or
(c) Where the applicant, where legally permissible, can undertake
the improvements in lieu of the Borough, subject to standards
and other conditions as may be imposed by the Borough.
(4) Cash contributions; payment. Where a cash contribution is
required by this Part 2, such contribution shall be deposited with
the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Borough, with a copy of the
applicant's transmittal letter forwarded to the Borough Council, the
Borough Engineer and the Board. Any and all monies received by
the Treasurer shall be deposited in an escrow account for the
purpose of undertaking the improvements specified. Where such
improvements are not undertaken or initiated for a period of 10
years, the funds may be retained by the Borough and may be used
for general Borough purposes, but in such event, neither the
applicant nor any of his/her heirs, successors, executors,
administrators or grantees shall be liable to the Borough for any
assessment for the purpose of installing any of the improvements
for which such cash contribution was made.
§ 120-16.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-16.4
1:441
D. Formula for determining applicant's share of off-tract improvements.
Where an off-tract improvement is required, the following criteria shall
be utilized in determining the proportionate share of such improvement
to the applicant:
(1) Streets and accessories. Street widening, alignment, corrections,
channelization of intersections, construction of barriers, new or
improved traffic signalization, signs, curbs, sidewalks, trees, utility
improvements not covered elsewhere and the construction of new
streets and other similar street or traffic improvements. The
applicant's proportionate share shall be calculated by the Borough
Engineer in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-42.
(2) Water facilities. Any Borough expense for water distribution
facilities, including the installation of new water mains, the
relocation of such facilities and the installation of other
appurtenances associated therewith. The applicant's proportionate
cost shall be in the ratio of the estimated daily use of water from
the property or properties in gallons to the sum of the deficiency in
gallons per day for the existing system or subsystem and the
estimated daily use of water for the proposed development. The
ratio thus calculated shall be increased by 10% for contingencies.
(3) Sewers. Sanitary sewage distribution facilities, including the
installation, relocation or replacement of collector and interceptor
sewers and the installation, relocation or replacement of other
appurtenances associated therewith. The applicant's proportionate
cost shall be in the ratio of the estimated daily flow in gallons to the
sum of the present deficient capacity for the existing system or
subsystem and the estimated daily flow from the proposed project
or development. In the case where the peak flow for the proposed
development may occur during the peak-flow period for the
existing system, the ratio shall be the estimated peak-flow rate
from the proposed development in gallons per minute to the sum of
the present peak-flow deficiency in the existing system or
subsystem and the estimated peak-flow rate from the proposed
development. The greater of the two ratios thus calculated shall be
increased by 10% for contingencies and shall be the ratio used to
determine the cost to the applicant.
(4) Drainage facilities. Stormwater and drainage improvements,
including installation, relocation or replacement of transmission
lines, culverts, catch basins and the installation, relocation or
replacement of other appurtenances associated therewith. The
applicant's proportionate cost shall be in the ratio of the estimated
peak surface runoff as proposed to be delivered into the existing
system measured in cubic feet per second to the sum of the existing
peak flow in cubic feet per second deficient for the existing system
and the estimated peak flow as proposed to be delivered. The ratio
thus calculated shall be increased by 10% for contingencies. The
applicant's engineer shall compute the drainage basin area, the
§ 120-16.4 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-16.4
1:442
area of the development and the percent of the total drainage basin
area occupied by the development. Where no drainage system
exists which will receive the flow of surface water from the
applicant's development, the applicant shall furnish all drainage
rights-of-way deemed to be necessary by the Board.
(5) General considerations. In calculating the proportionate or pro rata
amount of the cost of any required off-tract facilities which shall be
borne by the applicant, the Board shall also determine the pro rata
amount of cost to be borne by other owners of lands which will be
benefited by the proposed improvements.

A. The following standards and guidelines contained herein shall apply to
all development applications submitted for approval containing
proposed new buildings and structures or alterations or modifications
to existing structures.
B. These building design objectives are intended to assist the reviewing
agency in the review of specific development proposals:
(1) All buildings should be located with proper consideration of their
orientation and relationship to other buildings, both existing and
§ 120-17.4 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-17.5
1:448
proposed, in terms of light, air and usable open space; access
to public rights-of-way and off-street parking; height and bulk;
drainage and existing topography; trees and vegetation;
watercourses; solar access and energy conservation.
(2) Groups of related buildings shall be designed to present a
harmonious appearance in terms of architectural style and exterior
materials.
(3) Buildings should be designed to be attractive from all vantage
points, including fences, storage areas and rear entrances.
(4) Building setbacks should be varied to the extent practicable in
order to provide an interesting interplay of buildings and open
spaces.
(5) Accessory buildings and structures should be architecturally
treated in the same manner as principal structures.
(6) All exterior storage and service yards, loading docks and ramps,
electrical and mechanical equipment and enclosures, storage tanks
and the like shall be screened from the public view, within and from
the outside of the development, by a fence, wall or mature
landscape materials, consistent with the exterior design of the
building within the development.
(7) Colors, materials and finishes shall be coordinated in all exterior
elevations of buildings to achieve continuity of expression. All roof
and wall projections, such as gutters, flues, louvers, utility boxes,
vents, grills, downspouts, exposed flashing and overhead doors,
shall be painted or installed with an anodized or acrylic finish, in a
color to match adjacent surfaces.
(8) Buildings of a traditional design should have steeper roofs.
Overhangs should be consistent in the front and rear.
(9) All openings in the wall of a structure, such as windows and doors,
should relate to each other on each elevation, vertically and
horizontally, in a clearly defined order, and should take into account
orientation to the sun, in terms of architectural elements for sun
shading and consideration of the efficiencies of heat loss and gain
through such openings.
(10) Buildings and parking areas should be designed to relate to
existing grade conditions. Exposed basement walls are not
acceptable as an architectural treatment. All exposed basement
walls must be covered to relate properly to the side of the building.
(11) Landscape elements shall relate to architectural design elements
and shall be considered a strong unifying component of the overall
site design, reflecting the natural and man-made (architectural and
aesthetic) qualities of the development.
§ 120-17.5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-17.5
1:449
§ 120-17.6. Clearing and grading.
C. These residential design standards and guidelines are intended to
assist in the review of specific proposals:
(1) Residential design should create the appearance of individuality of
housing units and avoid the appearance of a large, undifferentiated
project.
(2) Dwelling units should have adequate interior living space, using
low-maintenance, high-quality and aesthetically attractive
materials.
(3) Easy access to outdoor space and parking from all residential units
should be provided.
(4) The design should provide a safe, well-lighted residential
environment, free of through traffic and congestion.
D. Dwelling units in a development which are designed for the possible
use by physically handicapped persons shall meet or exceed the New
Jersey Uniform Construction Code minimum property standards and
the additional requirements contained in N.J.A.C. 5:23-1 et seq.,
pertaining to barrier-free regulations.
E. The commercial office and industrial design standards contained below
are intended to assist in the review of specific proposals:
(1) Exterior materials may include brick, stone, anodized aluminum
and baked enamel metal panels, precast concrete and similar
materials, with appropriate texture and trim to prevent large,
undifferentiated facade of the same material.
(2) All roof planes or caps meeting the exterior facade shall have
overhangs or appropriate cornice and trim details.
(3) All major entrances to buildings shall be properly identified with
architectural elements, such as recessed entranceways, projected
overhangs and porticos.
(4) Flat roof canopies on metal pipe columns shall not be used on
commercial buildings.
(5) Window and door openings shall include appropriate trim and
either recesses or overhangs to promote a harmonious variety of
light and shade on the facade of the building.
(6) Buildings and structures used for functional purposes, such as
warehouses, indoor sports facilities and manufacturing facilities,
shall include appropriate landscaping adjacent to boundary facades
in the public view.

A. All grading, excavation or embankment construction shall be in
accordance with the approved final plat and shall provide for the
disposal of all stormwater runoff and such groundwater seepage as may
be encountered. All clearing, excavation and embankment construction
shall be in accordance with the applicable requirements of the New
Jersey Department of Transportation Standard Specifications. No
excavated material may be removed from the site, except in accordance
with an approved final plat, nor without the prior approval of the
Borough Engineer. The stockpile or removal of soil from a site, except in
relationship to an approved plan, shall not be permitted except as
provided by other ordinances of the Borough. Where borrow excavation
materials from off-site sources are required to complete the necessary
grading, such material shall meet the requirements of the Standard
Specifications for Borrow Excavation, Zone 3, and shall be subject to
the approval of the Borough Engineer. All trees to be saved must have a
snow fence erected at the dripline of the tree.
B. Material which the Borough Engineer judges unsuitable for use in
roadway embankments may be used for grading outside the roadway
right-of-way or in building areas with the permission of the Borough
Engineer and the Construction Official (for building areas). Any
unsuitable material which cannot be satisfactorily utilized on the site
shall be removed from the site and disposed of at places to be provided
by the developer.
C. No slopes shall be constructed which exceed a slope of one foot vertical
per three feet horizontal. The minimum slope shall be 1%.
D. Such slopes shall be suitably planted with perennial grasses or other
ground cover plantings in accordance with the plans approved by the
reviewing agency.
E. In areas where excavations or embankments would extend significantly
beyond road rights-of-way, thereby causing disruption to the natural
environment of the development, the reviewing agency may, upon the
application of the developer, consider or may, upon its own initiative,
direct the use of terraces, retaining walls, crib walls or other means of
maintaining roadway slopes.
(1) In any event, the entire roadway right-of-way shall be fully graded,
and any retaining walls, crib walls or terraces shall be located
outside of the roadway right-of-way, and their maintenance shall be
the responsibility of the owner of the property on which they are
constructed.
(2) The developer shall make suitable provisions in the instrument
transferring title to any property containing such terraces,
retaining walls or crib walls and shall provide a copy thereof to the
reviewing agency and the Borough Clerk.
§ 120-17.6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-17.6
1:451
(3) All graded areas within or outside of the roadway right-of-way shall
be neatly graded, topsoiled, fertilized and seeded to establish a
stand of perennial grasses.
F. The tops of slopes in excavations and the toe of slopes in embankment
areas shall not extend beyond the right-of-way line or, where provided
on the plan, to the limit of grading as shown on the final plan. Sidewalk
and easement areas shall slope at 2% to the top of the curb elevation,
and sidewalk construction shall conform to this slope.
G. Lot grading. Lots shall be graded to secure proper drainage and to
prevent the collection of stormwater. The grading shall be performed in
a manner which will minimize the damage to or destruction of trees
growing on the land. Topsoil shall be provided and/or redistributed on
the surface as cover and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting.
Grading plans shall have been submitted with the preliminary and final
plats, and any departure from these plans must be approved in
accordance with the requirements of this Part 2 for the modification of
improvements. Grading shall be designed to prevent or minimize
drainage to structures or improvements when major storms, exceeding
the design basis of the storm drainage system, occur.
(1) Wherever possible, the land shall be graded so that the stormwater
from each lot shall drain directly to the street. If it is impossible to
drain directly to the street, it shall be drained to a system of
interior yard drainage designed in accordance with the standards
for drainage facilities, and suitable drainage easements shall be
provided.
(2) Unless otherwise required by the Standard Specifications, all tree
stumps, masonry and other obstructions shall be removed to a
depth of two feet below finished grade.
(3) The minimum slope for lawns shall be 2%, and, for smooth, hardfinished
surfaces, other than roadways, 3/4 of 1%.
(4) The maximum grade for lawns within five feet of a building shall be
5%. The maximum slope within 10 feet of a property line shall be
5%. No lawn areas shall exceed 30% in slope. Further, when there
exists a vertical grade differential that exceeds two feet between
first-floor elevations of structures on adjacent properties, the
reviews may require the use of retaining walls, terracing or other
features to minimize the impact, visual and otherwise, on the
adjoining property.
(5) Retaining walls installed in slope control areas shall be constructed
of heavy treated timber or logs, reinforced concrete, other
reinforced masonry or of other construction acceptable to the
Borough Engineer and adequately designed and detailed on the
final plat to carry all earth pressures, including any surcharges.
The height of retaining walls shall not exceed 1/3 of the horizontal
distance from the foundation wall of any building to the face of the
§ 120-17.6 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-17.6

§ 120-17.7. Streets and street design.
retaining wall. Should the Borough adopt, subsequently to this Part
2, standard details for such construction, the same shall govern.
(6) The developer shall take all necessary precautions to prevent any
siltation of streams during construction. Such provisions may
include, but are not limited to, construction and maintenance of
siltation basins or holding ponds and division berms through the
course of construction.
A. All major and minor arterial, collector, local collector, local and
marginal access streets shall be designed in accordance with the
proposals contained in the Master Plan of the Borough and in
accordance with this section.
(1) Upon receipt by the reviewing agency of any subdivision or site
plans calling for the installation of new streets or the extension of
old streets, the plats shall be referred to the Borough Engineer,
Police Department and Fire Department for review.
(a) They shall make recommendations as to the acceptable
minimum widths of each street and shall base the
recommendations upon such factors as the location, proposed
use and intensity of traffic, with an emphasis upon safety
considerations of a fire, first aid and police nature.
(b) These recommendations shall be submitted to the Borough
Engineer to be considered in conjunction with such studies and
statistics and other data which the Engineer shall have
assembled as a basis for determining minimum street widths
within the Borough.
(2) The enumerated standards are to be construed as minimum
standards and may be increased where, because of high traffic
volumes, steep grades or other such reasons, the municipal agency
determines that such action is necessary.
(3) In residential subdivisions, the minimum street width required
shall be in accordance with the Residential Site Improvement
Standards (N.J.A.C. 5:21).
B. The arrangement of streets not shown on the Master Plan or Official
Map shall be such as to provide for the appropriate extension and/or
realignment of existing streets, except that local and collector streets
should only be extended when such extension is necessary, and the
municipal agency concurs that such extension will promote safety and
conform to the street standards contained elsewhere in this Part 2.
C. Where developments abut existing roadways, sufficient right-of-way
shall be reserved for the functional classification of the street in
question.
§ 120-17.6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-17.7
1:453
(1) If the subdivision or site plan is along one side only, 1/2 of the
required extra width shall be dedicated.
(2) The new cross section for the existing road shall be constructed so
as to provide a cross section constructed to the satisfaction of the
Borough Engineer.
D. Local streets shall be designed in accordance with the schedule of
street design standards and the requirements contained herein:
(1) No street or road shall be designed which has an elevation at the
center line lower than the one-hundred-year-flood elevation of the
area as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
(2) Local streets shall be arranged to discourage through traffic.
(3) Culs-de-sac (dead-end streets) should have a center-line length,
from the intersecting street center line to the center point of the
turnaround of the cul-de-sac, of not less than 100 feet nor longer
than 2,000 feet and should not provide access to more than 25 lots
or as applicable within the design criteria of specific zones in Part
3, Zoning.
(a) They shall provide an end turnaround with a pavement radius
of not less than 40 feet and a property line radius of not less
than 50 feet and tangent whenever possible to the right side of
the street, when viewed toward the closed end.
(b) In the event that it is contemplated that a dead-end street shall
be extended in the future, a temporary turnaround, meeting
the aforementioned design criteria, shall be required, and
provisions shall be made for future extension of the street and
reversion of the excess right-of-way to the adjoining properties.
(4) Loop streets.
(a) Loop streets should provide access to not more than 45 lots,
except that, where access is provided by a combination of a
short loop street and cul-de-sac, the maximum shall be 60 lots,
provided that the length of the loop street will not exceed
3,000 feet.
(b) Loop streets shall have both of their termini located on the
same street.
(5) P-loops, which are loop streets with a single access point, should
have an entrance not exceeding 700 feet in distance from the loop
intersection.
(a) There should also be provided an emergency vehicular and
pedestrian right-of-way of 15 feet in width from the loop
providing access to a street which is not a part of the P-loop.
§ 120-17.7 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-17.7
1:454

3,000 feet.
(c) P-loops should provide access to no more than 45 lots, and the
entrance street should be designed in accordance with the
design standards for collector streets.
E. In any development, it shall be the duty of the reviewing agency to
approve classification of proposed streets according to their use and in
accordance with the Residential Site Improvement Standards. In
making decisions, the reviewing agency shall refer to the Master Plan
and the Union County Planning Board classification of roadways and
shall consider conditions within the development and the surrounding
areas and shall use as a guide the street classification and criteria
contained herein:
(1) A "local street" is a street serving only single-family residences and,
where feasible, should be either a cul-de-sac or a loop street
meeting the requirements hereinabove set forth.
(a) A street which serves traffic having origins and destinations
other than within the lots which abut the street shall not be
considered a local street.
(b) The traffic normally expected on a local street shall be 400
vehicles per day.
(c) The design speed for local streets shall be 25 miles per hour.
(2) A "collector street" is generally a street gathering traffic from local
streets and feeding it into a system of arterial highways.
(a) Even if laid out as a local street, a street should be considered
a collector street if it provides access or could provide access
to more than 150 lots, or would be utilized by traffic other than
residential in nature.
(b) Collector streets should generally be expected to carry traffic
volumes of approximately 3,000 vehicles per day.
(c) The design speed of collector streets, for alignment and sight
distance purposes, should be 50 miles per hour.
(3) "Arterials" are any federal, state or county highways intended to
carry traffic between other arterials and from the Borough to
destinations outside the Borough.
(4) Street classifications will be approved by the municipal agency in
accordance with the foregoing definitions, in accordance with the
provisions of the Master Plan and Official Map, if such is adopted,
in accordance with the provisions of applicable county and state
regulations or plans or, in the absence of specific information from
§ 120-17.7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-17.7
1:455
the above, in accordance with its own best judgment concerning
the use to which the various streets in any development will be put.
F. All lots abutting collector streets should be provided with suitable
driveways for two cars with turnarounds eliminating any necessity for
vehicles to back into the collector street.
G. Other means of providing a satisfactory buffer separating through and
local traffic shall be provided as may be deemed proper by the
municipal agency.
H. Dwellings on corner lots shall have their driveway access on the
roadway designed and intended to carry the lesser amount of traffic.
I. Street intersections shall be designed according to the standards
contained herein:
(1) No more than two streets shall cross the same point. Street
intersections shall be right angles wherever possible, and
intersections of less than 60° (measured at the center line of
streets) shall not be permitted.
(2) Local streets should not enter the same side of collector streets at
intervals of less than 500 feet or arterials at intervals of less than
1,200 feet.
(3) Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided. Streets which enter collectors or arterials from opposite
sides shall be directly opposite to each other or must be separated
by at least 300 feet between their center lines, measured along the
center line of an intersected collector; or 500 feet along the center
line of an arterial.
(4) Four-way (cross) intersections involving minor or collector streets
shall be avoided.
J. Street layouts shall be in accordance with the provisions contained
herein:
(1) Curved local streets are preferred to discourage speed and
monotony. The maximum tangent distance between curves shall not
exceed 1,000 feet.
(2) The municipal agency in all cases may require provisions for
continuing circulation patterns onto adjacent properties and, for
this purpose, may require the provision of stub streets (street
extensions) abutting adjacent properties.
(3) Residential development areas containing more than 100 lots or
housing units should have two access points from collector streets
or arterial highways.
§ 120-17.7 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-17.7
1:456
(4) A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between
reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
K. Street names and development names shall not duplicate, nearly
duplicate or be phonetically similar to the names of any existing streets
or developments in the Borough or contiguous areas of other
communities. Any continuation of an existing street shall have the same
street name. New streets shall be named by the Special Street Naming
Committee, established by appointment from the office of Mayor. The
Committee shall be advisory in nature and shall be appointed by the
Mayor when street naming services are needed. The Special Street
Naming Committee shall consist of five members. The Mayor shall
appoint one member from the administration, one member from the
Kenilworth Historical Society, one member from the Borough Council
and two members from the Kenilworth Central Veterans Committee.
The Committee shall function until its duties are complete. The Special
Street Naming Committee shall select proper street names as set forth
below:
(1) All new streets to be established in the Borough shall be named
after a Borough resident who died in combat in the service of the
United States until such names shall have been exhausted unless
the Special Street Naming Committee believes the street shall be
named in accordance with Subsection K(2) below. A list of such
residents shall be prepared and updated by the Kenilworth Central
Veterans Committee and placed on file with the Borough Clerk.
(2) All new streets shall be named after a historical figure or family of
the Borough when the proposed new street is to be constructed
upon their property, or which had been owned by such historical
figure or family.
(3) Any new street not falling into either category shall be named in
the discretion of the Special Street Naming Committee.
(4) All street names selected by the Special Street Naming Committee
must then be approved by the Borough Council and submitted to
the Planning Board for final approval in accordance with the terms
of this subsection.
L. The developer shall complete all improvements to the limits of the
development, unless other provisions have been made and approved by
the municipal agency.
(1) In those instances where completion of certain improvements
would not be possible until the development of adjacent land takes
place, alternate temporary improvements may be constructed,
subject to the approval of the municipal agency.
(2) Cash or a certified check representing the difference between the
value of the temporary improvements and the required
improvements may be accepted by the Borough Council to be

(2) Collector streets: 60 feet.
(3) Minor streets: 50 feet.
(4) The right-of-way width for internal roads and alleys in multifamily,
commercial and industrial developments shall be determined on an
individual basis, and in all cases shall be of sufficient width and
design to safely accommodate the maximum traffic, parking and
loading needs and maximum access for firefighting equipment.
N. There shall be no reserve strips or areas controlling access to streets
except where control and disposal of the land comprising such strips or
areas have been placed under jurisdiction of the Borough Council under
conditions approved by the municipal agency.
A. Roadways and all appurtenances, including subgrade, subbase, base
courses and pavements, shall be constructed in accordance with the
applicable requirements of the Standard Specifications as modified
herein. All subsurface utilities, including service connections
(terminating at least two feet behind the sidewalk), to each lot and all
storm drains shall be installed in all roadway areas prior to the
construction of final pavement surfaces.
B. All roadways shall be constructed with either a bituminous concrete
flexible pavement structure or a Portland cement concrete rigid
pavement structure. Only one type of pavement shall be utilized
throughout any development.
C. The pavement structure design for each particular development
utilizing either a flexible or rigid pavement type must be approved by
the Borough Engineer.
(1) The pavement design shall be based upon traffic-loading
projections and field sampling and laboratory analysis of the
subgrade soils to be encountered in roadway areas in the
development and shall follow current design recommendations of
the Asphalt Institute, the Portland Cement Concrete Association or

Engineer.
(b) Any areas of the base course in need of repair shall be removed
and replaced at the direction of the Borough Engineer.
(c) If the Borough Engineer directs, a leveling course of FABC
(Mix I-5) material shall be placed on any uneven or belowgrade
base courses prior to the placement of finished
pavement.
(2) No pavement surfaces shall be placed unless permission to do so
has been granted by the Borough Engineer.
H. Concrete pavements shall be constructed in accordance with the
requirements of the Standard Specifications.
I. In areas where alternate pavement types are proposed or desired,
either for decorative purposes, because of physical restrictions or
existing conditions or because of limitations or shortages in certain
types of construction materials, a detail of the type and/or location of
alternate pavement type proposed shall be submitted for approval with
the preliminary and/or final plat.
(1) The use of alternate pavement types may only be permitted if the
applicant submits for review and approval details and
specifications concerning the equipment, materials and methods
proposed for use and if the Borough Engineer has inspected the
installation of and tested and approved of a suitable sample section
of such pavement.
(2) In the event that the Borough Engineer does not approve the
sample section of pavement, the developer shall remove the same
section and replace it with a type of pavement permitted by this

§ 120-17.10. Concrete requirements.
A. All concrete used in any subdivision or site improvement shall be
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Standard
Specifications for the various classes of concrete used, except that the
twenty-eight-day compressive strength of the concrete used shall not be
less than the following:
Type of Concrete
Strength
(pounds per square inch)
Class A 5,000
Class B 4,500
Class C 4,000
Class D 3,500
B. Unless specific written permission is obtained from the Borough
Engineer to the contrary, only concrete obtained from dry-batched,
redi-mix trucks shall be allowed.
C. Concrete shall be cured with a compound in accordance with the
following methods or materials:
(1) Methods of application. The compound shall be applied in a
continuous uniform film by means of power-operated pressurespraying
or distributing equipment at the rate directed by the
Engineer, but not less than one gallon per 200 square feet of
surface. The equipment for applying the compound shall provide
for adequate agitation of the compound during application and
must be approved by the Engineer before work is started. If the
compound becomes too thick for satisfactory application during
cold weather, the material may be warmed in a water bath at a
temperature not over 100° F. Thinning with solvents will not be
permitted. Should the method of applying the compound produce a
nonuniform film, its use shall be discontinued, and the curing shall
be done by another method approved by the Engineer that will
conform to the requirements for curing concrete.
(2) Materials for curing. Liquid compound, clear or translucent. Clear
or translucent liquid-curing compound shall consist of a blend of
resins and other suitable materials held in solution in a volatile
solvent. It shall not separate on standing, shall be nontoxic and
shall become dry to the touch within four hours after being applied
to the concrete under ordinary conditions. Acceptance for
continued use also will be based upon satisfactory field
performance.
(3) Consistency. The consistency of the compound shall be such that it
can be applied to the concrete in the amount specified as a fine
spray by means of an atomizing nozzle.

1:461
§ 120-17.11. Curbs and gutters.
Curbing shall be constructed on both sides of all streets shown on all major
and minor subdivisions and shall be required for all plot and site plans in
accordance with municipal standards. Unless otherwise noted, all parking
areas and driveways on site plans shall be curbed. Concrete stops, unless
part of a planned stormwater management plan, shall not be permitted.
(4) Character of film. The compound shall adhere to damp, vertical or
horizontal concrete surfaces forming a continuous coherent film
when applied at the specified rate. When dry, the film shall not be
tacky or track off the concrete when walked upon, nor impact a
slippery condition to the surface.
(5) Color. The compound shall produce no darkening or changing of
the color of the concrete to which it is applied. It shall, however, be
of such a nature or so treated that the film will be distinctively
visible for at least four hours after application. Any coloring matter
added to the compound shall be a fugitive organic dye of a color
approved by the Engineer. All trace of this color shall be indistinct
30 days after application.
(6) Reaction with concrete. The compound shall not react deleteriously
with the wet course and shall form a superficial layer over the
surface thereof.
(7) Moisture retention. When tested in accordance with current ASTM
Designation C 156, the moisture loss shall be not more than 0.055
gram per square centimeter of the mortar specimen surface, based
on the amount of water in the mortar at the time the curing
material is applied.
A. Layout. The arrangement of streets not shown on the Master Plan or
Official Map shall be such as to provide for the appropriate extension of
existing streets and, where necessary in order to promote orderly flow
of traffic, safety and welfare of the public, shall be such as to provide for
appropriate extension to adjoining properties for future streets.
B. Minor streets. Minor streets shall be so designed as to discourage
through traffic.
C. Arterial streets; service roads; buffers. Subdivisions abutting arterial
streets shall provide a marginal service road or reserve frontage with a
buffer strip for planting, or some other means of separation of through
and local traffic as the Planning Board may determine appropriate.
D. Width. The right-of-way width shall be measured from lot line to lot line
and shall not be less than the following:
(1) Arterial streets: 80 feet.
(2) Collector streets: 60 feet.
§ 120-17.10 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-17.11
1:462
(3) Minor streets: 50 feet.
(4) The right-of-way width for internal roads and alleys in multifamily,
commercial and industrial developments shall be determined on an
individual basis, and in all cases shall be of sufficient width and
design to safely accommodate the maximum traffic, parking and
loading needs and maximum access for firefighting equipment.
E. Reserve strips. No subdivision showing reserve strips controlling
access to streets shall be approved, except where the control and
disposal of land comprising such strips has been placed in the Borough
Council under conditions recommended by the Planning Board.
F. Street grades. Grades of arterial and collector streets shall not exceed
4% unless, because of local conditions, the Borough Engineer may
approve another percentage. Grades on other streets shall not exceed
10%. No street shall have a minimum grade of less than 0.5%.
G. Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as
is possible. In no case shall they be less than 60° nor more than 120°.
The block corners at intersections shall be rounded at the curbline with
a curve having a radius of not less than 20 feet.
H. Street jogs. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than 125 feet
shall be prohibited.
I. Reverse curves. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced
between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
J. Connecting curves. When connecting street lines deflect from each
other at any one point by more than 10° and not more than 45°, they
shall be connected by a curve with a radius of 300 feet.
K. Vertical curves. All changes in grades in excess of 1 1/2% shall be
connected by vertical curves of sufficient length to provide a smooth
transaction and proper sight distance.
L. Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets and culs-de-sac shall not be longer
than 1,000 feet from the nearest intersection and shall provide a
turnaround at the end with a radius of not less than 50 feet to the base
of the curb and tangent, whenever possible, to the right side of the
street. If a dead-end street is of a temporary nature, a similar
turnaround shall be provided and provisions made for future extension
of the street and reversion of the excess right-of-way to the adjoining
properties. Wherever a temporary or permanent turnaround is
proposed on any street, the front yard setback line shall be measured
from the turnaround.

§ 120-17.12. Sidewalks and aprons.
(1) All new streets to be established in the Borough shall be named
after a Borough resident who died in combat in the service of the
United States until such names shall have been exhausted, unless
the Special Street Naming Committee believes the street shall be
named in accordance with Subsection M(2) below. A list of such
residents shall be prepared and updated by the Kenilworth Central
Veterans Committee and placed on file with the Borough Clerk.
(2) All new streets shall be named after a historical figure or family of
the Borough when the proposed new street is to be constructed
upon their property, or which had been owned by such historical
figure or family.
(3) Any new street not falling into either category shall be named in
the discretion of the Special Street Naming Committee.
(4) All street names selected by the Special Street Naming Committee
must then be approved by the Borough Council and submitted to
the Planning Board for final approval in accordance with the terms
of this Subsection M.
N. Off-street parking. Off-street parking shall be required. Parking layouts
shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Board and shall
normally include turnarounds. Residential lots shall be so arranged that
there is no backing out into the street.
O. Street construction permit. Before any street dedicated to public use in
an existing subdivision may be constructed or reconstructed hereafter,
the owners of abutting properties, the developer or other parties in
interest shall make application, in writing, for a permit to the Borough
Council and Planning Board, specifying the nature and location of the
improvement to be made, and shall furnish the Borough Council a
certificate from the Planning Board showing that the proposed street
construction or reconstruction conforms to the provisions of this Part 2.
The Borough Engineer shall inspect the proposed improvement and
report to the Borough Council before the issuance of the permit.

Planning Board for recommendation prior to final approval by the
Borough Council.
A. Sidewalk construction shall be required on both sides of all streets
within a development and entirely around the perimeter of all culs-desac.
Where the development abuts an existing street, the sidewalk shall
be constructed only on that side or as approved by the reviewing
agency. Sidewalks shall also be constructed at any other places, such as
pedestrian walkways or access points to open space, as shown on or
required at the approval of the final plat.
§ 120-17.11 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-17.12
1:464
§ 120-17.13. Guardrails.
(1) Installation of sidewalks may be waived by the reviewing agency,
with the written permission of the Borough Council, at the request
of the developer or on its own initiative, provided that, upon
granting such a waiver, the developer shall be required to pay the
Borough of Kenilworth an amount equal to the reasonable cost of
installing said sidewalks, said amount to be determined by the
Borough Engineer upon submission and consideration of various
estimates and other documentation from the developer, other
interested parties and the office of the Borough Engineer itself.
(2) All funds collected by the Borough from developers as a result of
waivers granted in accordance with this section shall be
maintained in a sidewalk construction account, the proceeds of
which shall be available to install sidewalks throughout the
Borough where and as authorized by the Borough Council.
(3) Nothing contained herein shall affect the right of the Borough to
enact ordinances requiring assessments for sidewalks from
property owners as authorized under N.J.S.A. 40:65-2 or other
statutory rights granted to municipalities.
B. Sidewalks within a street right-of-way shall generally be located with
the sidewalk edge farthest from the roadway, placed one foot from the
property line. Sidewalks not within street rights-of-way shall be located
to provide for the most likely routes of pedestrian travel. In cases where
the topography dictates or a proposed development provides for the
extension of an existing street or abuts an existing street, where
sidewalks have already been installed in a location other than as
specified above or where such variations in sidewalk locations are
needed to preserve trees or natural features, the municipal agency may
approve alternate sidewalk locations in order to provide for
preservation of physical features or the continuation of the existing
sidewalks. Where appropriate, sidewalks shall be designed to discharge
stormwater away from connecting paved surfaces and toward
neighboring lawns where feasible to disconnect these impervious
surfaces.
C. Sidewalks shall be four feet wide and four inches thick of Class B, airentrained
Portland cement concrete. Joints shall be cut in the sidewalk
at intervals equal to the width of the sidewalk. Preformed cellular

for approval as part of the final plat submission. The use of cables, lines
or chains shall not be permitted.
A. Size. Block length and width, or acreage within bounding roads, shall
be such as to accommodate the size of lot required in the area by Part 3,
Zoning, and to provide adequately for sewage disposal, convenient
access, circulation control and safety of street traffic.
B. Minimum length and width. Blocks shall not be more than 600 feet in
length, nor a lesser number of feet in width than is necessary to comply
with the Borough zoning requirements, except where the Planning
Board may deem that existing or future conditions warrant a variation
from such requirements.
C. Commercial block size. For business, commercial or industrial use,
block size shall be sufficient to meet all area and yard requirements for
such use.

Board.
A. Unless otherwise provided in this Part 2, lot area and dimensions shall
not be less than the requirements of the respective zoning districts as
set forth in Part 3, Zoning.
(1) The reviewing agency may require larger lots where additional
area will partially or completely eliminate the necessity of changes
in grade, which, in the opinion of the Board, would cause
unreasonable destruction of the topography or environment or
would create drainage or erosion problems.
(2) The reviewing agency may require larger lots adjacent to collector
or arterial streets where, in the opinion of the Board, the larger lots
would promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public
and the residents of the development.
(3) The reviewing agency may require larger lots where such lots are
plotted on a tract or tracts containing tidal or freshwater wetlands,
§ 120-17.13 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-17.15
1:466
steep slopes in excess of 8%, lakes and ponds, stream corridors,
floodways and floodplains. Where such conditions exist, the Board
may require that each lot contain an area unencumbered by the
aforementioned conditions equal to the minimum area
requirements of the respective zone district.
B. Insofar as is practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight
streets and radial to curved streets.
C. Lot line on widened street. Where extra width is to be provided for the
widening of existing streets, lot measurements shall begin at the
proposed right-of-way line, and all setbacks shall be measured from
such lines unless otherwise provided by this Part 2.
D. Unsuitable lots. All lots shall be suitable for the purpose for which they
are intended to be used. To prevent the use of lots which are not
suitable because of adverse topography, flood conditions, shallow depth
to water table or similar circumstances:
(1) The reviewing agency may withhold approval of such lots or
require revisions in a layout of the subdivision to provide that the
area of the unsuitable lot is included in other lots by increasing the
size of the remaining lots.
(2) Unsuitable lots may be included in an area to be deeded to the
Borough or other public or quasi-public body and will be held in
their natural state for conservation and/or recreation purposes.
(3) Some other suitable arrangement could be derived to alleviate the
condition.
E. A minimum of five substantially different front elevations with varied
setbacks, as approved by the reviewing agency, shall be used for
dwellings in each subdivision.
F. Only those trees shall be removed as shall be necessary to permit
construction of streets, driveways, lawns and dwellings and other
authorized structures.
G. In accordance with the Tax Map specifications of the State of New
Jersey, dated May 1975, prepared by the State of New Jersey,
Department of the Treasury, as amended, subdivided lots and blocks
shall generally bear the original numbers, with a decimal and a number
added as a subscript. Lot and block numbers shall be assigned by the
Borough Engineer.
H. House numbers shall be assigned to each lot prior to final plat approval
by the reviewing agency.
I. Lot frontage. Each lot shall front on an approved street accepted or to
be accepted by the Borough.

J. All structures shall be accessible by means of an approved driveway.
The driveway shall be not less than 10 feet wide and shall have a centerline
grade of not less than 0.5% and not greater than 10%. For all nonsingle-
family uses, driveways must provide turnarounds to eliminate
the necessity of any vehicle backing onto any street.
A. Lot dimensions, front, side and rear yards, and total area shall not be
less than the requirements of Part 3, Zoning.
B. Each lot must front upon an approved street at least 50 feet in width at
the street line, except lots fronting on streets described in
§ 120-17.11D(4).
C. Where extra width has been dedicated for widening of existing streets,
lots shall begin at such extra width lines, and all setbacks shall be
measured from such lines.
D. Where there is a question as to the suitability of a lot or lots for their
intended use due to factors such as rock formations, flood conditions,
sewage disposal or similar circumstances, the Planning Board may,
after adequate investigation, with professional assistance, if deemed
necessary, withhold approval of such lots.
A. Public open space or common open space shall be proposed to be
provided in conjunction with applications for development for
subdivisions or site plans in accordance with requirements contained
herein.
B. Natural features, such as trees, brooks, hilltops and views, shall be
preserved whenever possible in designing any subdivision containing
such features.
C. If the Master Plan or the Official Map provides for the reservation of
designated streets, public drainageways, flood-control basins or public
areas within the proposed development, before approving a subdivision
or site plan, the reviewing agency may further require that such streets,
ways, basins or areas be shown on the plat in locations and sizes
suitable to their intended uses.
(1) Any land shown on the Master Plan as proposed for park,
playground, school site or other public use shall be designated and
reserved for such use.
D. Where it is considered appropriate by the reviewing agency, portions of
proposed open spaces may be designated for passive and/or active
recreational activities.

of any open space, by sale or otherwise, except to an
organization conceived and established to own and maintain
the open space for the benefit of such development.
(b) Thereafter, such organization shall not be dissolved or dispose
of any of its open space without first offering to dedicate the
same to the Borough.
(2) In the event that such organization shall fail to maintain the open

modification thereof shall not be cured within 35 days or any
permitted extension thereof, the Borough, in order to preserve
the open space and maintain the same for a period of one year,
may enter upon and maintain such land. The entry and
maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the
open space by the owners.
[1] Before the expiration of the year, the administrative officer
shall, upon his initiative or upon the request of the
organization theretofore responsible for the maintenance
of the open space, call a public hearing upon 15 days'
written notice to such organization and to the owners of
the development to be held by the administrative officer
(Zoning Officer), at which hearing such organization and

A. Buffering and screening design and standards.
(1) Guidelines. The following guidelines shall be used to prepare and
review buffering and screening for any development plan. The
provision of buffer areas and screening within such areas shall take
into account the opportunities and constraints of existing
conditions on the site, such as existing vegetation to be preserved,
critical views into and out of the site, the days and hours of
operation, intensity of use of the proposed development, potential
off-site impacts and other such issues.
(2) General standards. The following standards shall be used to
prepare and review screening devices required in this article:
(a) Evergreen trees or hedges. Where an evergreen screen is
utilized, such plantings shall be sufficiently dense so as to
provide a minimum of 75% of the required screening at time of
planting. Arrangement of plantings shall be in a continuous
row and may be overlapped or staggered within such row.
Placement of such plantings shall provide maximum protection
to existing vegetation to be preserved located in the buffer
area and on adjacent properties.
(b) Walls and fences. Where a masonry wall or solid wooden fence
is utilized, the design of such shall be architecturally
compatible with the style, materials, colors and details of the
building(s) on the site. Where such wall or fence fronts toward
or is visible from a public right-of-way, foundation plantings
shall be planted along the base of all visible portions of the wall
or fence.
(c) Earth berms. Where an earth berm is utilized, it shall be
designed to have a maximum side slope of one increment high
to two increments wide or a ratio of one high to two wide (one
to two). The minimum width of the top of a berm shall be four
feet. Berms shall be composed of a soil type sufficient to
sustain the growth of plantings it will support. Berms shall be
landscaped with combinations of evergreen and deciduous

surrounding all sides of a parking lot exposed to view.
Where such parking area is located on a tract adjacent to a
residential use or district, such buffering shall consist of a
minimum ten-foot-wide area surrounding all sides of a
parking lot exposed to view.
[2] Screening shall consist of a minimum four-foot-high
visually impervious screen to be located within the
buffering area. Where such parking area is located on a
tract adjacent to a residential use or district, such
screening shall consist of a minimum six-foot-high visually
impervious screen. The height of any required screen shall
decrease to a maximum of three feet in height where
driveways approach sidewalks or walkways in order to
provide adequate visibility of pedestrians from motor
vehicles.

1:480
(c) Loading areas. All loading areas, including loading dock areas
of buildings and driveways providing access to the same, shall
be suitably buffered and screened to minimize the impacts of
noise, loading and unloading activities, lighting and glare,
exhaust fumes, views of loading and unloading vehicles and
other nuisances. Buffering and screening shall minimize such
impacts both within the site itself as well as from adjacent and
nearby properties and public rights-of-way, as follows:
[1] Buffering shall consist of a minimum ten-foot-wide area
surrounding all sides of a loading area exposed to view.
Where such loading area is located on a tract adjacent to a
residential use or district, such buffering shall consist of a
minimum twenty-five-foot-wide area surrounding all sides
of a parking lot exposed to view.
[2] Screening shall consist of a minimum ten-foot-high visually
impervious screen. If such screen consists of a wall or
fence, the buffer area between the wall or fence and the lot
line shall be a minimum of 10 feet in width and shall also
be extensively planted with both deciduous and evergreen
trees.
(d) Disposal and collection areas. All areas used for solid waste
disposal and recyclable collection facilities shall be suitably

person, with an eye level from grade of approximately 5 1/2
feet, is not able to see the lowest 20% of the total antenna
height from a distance of 25 feet from the lot line containing
such antenna. In no instance, however, shall such screening be
less than six feet in height; however, any fence greater than six
feet in height shall require a variance from the provisions of
this subsection. Such screening may utilize a solid wooden
fence, earth berms, closely spaced evergreen plantings or
some combination of those devices. If evergreen plantings are
utilized, such shall be sufficiently dense as to achieve 75% of
the required screening at planting.
B. Landscaping design guidelines and standards.
(1) The following guidelines shall be used to prepare and review
landscaping for any development plan. The landscaping plan shall
be prepared by a New Jersey certified landscape architect.
(a) Landscaping. The entire development shall be extensively
landscaped in accordance with a plan conceived as a complete
pattern and style throughout the total site. All areas of the site
not occupied by buildings and other improvements shall be
intensively planted with trees, shrubs, hedges, ground cover
and perennials and annuals. Landscaping shall be provided to
achieve the following:
[1] Preservation and enhancement, to the greatest extent
possible, of existing natural features on the site, including
vegetation, land forms and bodies of water.
[2] Assistance in adapting a site to its proposed development.
[3] Mitigation and control of environmental and community
impacts from a development.
[4] Creation of an attractive appearance for the development,
as viewed from both within the site itself and the
surrounding area.
[5] Enhancement of the habitability of a development.
[6] Definition of yard areas and other open space.
§ 120-17.25 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-17.25
1:482
[7] Energy conservation and micro-climatic control.
[8] Maintenance of a desirable ecological balance on a
developed site.

[7] Trellises, pergolas, gazebos and other accessory
structures.
[8] Fences, walls and other screens.
[9] Street or site furniture.
[10] Art and sculpture.
(2) General standards. The following general standards shall be used
to prepare and review landscaping for any development plan:
(a) Plant species. The selection of plant species to be used shall be
appropriate in terms of function and size and shall be hardy for
the climatic zone in which the Borough is located.
Consideration shall be given to soil conditions, availability of
water, exposure to sunlight and other existing conditions.
Plantings shall be selected from the recommended Borough
plant list.
(b) Planting sizes. Deciduous trees shall have a minimum caliper
of three inches at time of planting. Evergreen trees shall be a
minimum of six feet in height at time of planting. Low-growing
evergreen shrubs shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 feet in height at
time of planting. Size of other plantings shall depend on setting
and type of plant material.
(c) Planting specifications. Only nursery-grown plant material
shall be utilized. All trees, shrubs and ground cover shall be
planted according to accepted horticultural standards and the
Borough's approved planting specifications. All grass shall be
planted in accordance with the New Jersey State Soil
§ 120-17.25 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-17.25
1:483
Conservation Committee's Standards for Soil Erosion and
Sedimentation Control in New Jersey, current edition.
(d) Mulch. Trees and other vegetation that have been removed
may be reduced to chips and used as mulch in landscaped
areas.
(e) Maintenance. Plantings shall be watered regularly and in a
manner appropriate for the specific plant material through the
first growing season. All landscaped areas shall be well
maintained and kept free of all debris, rubbish, weeds, tall
grass, other overgrown conditions and the storage of any
equipment or materials.
(f) Replacement of dead plantings. The developer shall be
required to replace dead or dying plant material for a period of
two years from the date of issuance of a final zoning permit for
occupancy and shall post a maintenance guaranty for such
pursuant to Article 6 of this chapter. If plant material is dead or
dying during a planting season, it shall be replaced that same
season. If plant material is dead or dying during a nonplanting
season, it shall be replaced as soon as is reasonably possible at
the start of the next planting season.
(3) Specific standards. The following standards shall be used to
prepare and review landscaping on any development plan:
(a) Parking lots. The interior area of all parking lots shall be
landscaped to provide visual relief from the undesirable and
monotonous appearance of extensive parking areas and to
provide shading that will reduce solar heat gain to both the
surface of the parking lot and vehicles parked thereon. Such
landscaped areas shall be provided in protected planting
islands or peninsulas within the perimeter of the parking lot
and shall be placed so as not to obstruct the vision of motorists.
The area and types of plantings shall be provided based on the
number of parking spaces in the lot, as follows:
[1] For parking lots with 10 spaces or fewer, no such interior
landscaping shall be required if the Board determines
there is adequate landscaping directly surrounding the
perimeter of the parking lot. If the Board finds that such
landscaping is inadequate, then the requirements of
Subsection B(3)(a)[2] below shall apply.
[2] For parking lots with 11 or more spaces, a minimum of 5%
of the interior area of the parking lot shall be landscaped
with a minimum of one deciduous tree planted for every
five parking spaces. The remainder of any such interior
planting areas not containing trees shall be planted with
low-growing evergreen shrubs. If all of the above required
trees cannot all be located within such interior planting

1:484
§ 120-17.26. Public use and service areas.
areas, then such remaining trees shall be planted in
locations directly surrounding the perimeter of the
parking lot.
(b) Foundation plantings. The base of all sides of a building shall
be planted with foundation plantings consisting of evergreen
and/or semi-evergreen shrubs and trees. Such plantings shall
be a minimum of two feet high at time of planting and spaced
an average of three feet on center.
(c) Slope plantings. All cut and fill areas, terraces, earth berms
and roadway embankments with slopes steeper than one
increment vertical to three increments horizontal shall be
sufficiently landscaped to prevent erosion.
(d) Drainage facilities. Detention basins, headwalls, outlet
structures, concrete flow channels, riprap channels and other
drainage facilities shall be suitably planted with shrubs and
trees. Detention basin embankments shall be extensively
landscaped with wet-site-tolerant plantings.
(e) Energy conservation. Landscaping shall be designed to
conserve energy, such as the planting of evergreen windbreaks
to provide shielding from northwesterly winds during the
winter and deciduous shade trees to reduce solar heat gain
during the summer.
(f) Street or site furniture. Benches, trash receptacles, kiosks,
phone booths and other street or site furniture shall be located
and sized in accordance with the functional need of such.
Selection of such furniture shall take into consideration issues
of durability, maintenance and vandalism. All such furniture
shall be architecturally compatible with the style, materials,
colors and details of buildings on the site.
A. Utility easement. In large-scale developments, easements along rear
property lines or elsewhere for utility installation may be required.
Such easements shall be at least 20 feet wide and located in
consultation with the companies or Borough departments concerned.
B. Drainage easement. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater
easement or drainage right-of-way at least 15 feet wide, conforming
substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and such further width or
construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose of disposing
of stormwater and for flood control. The developer shall deed areas
deemed necessary for flood control by the Planning Board to the
Borough.

requirements, but the lowest point in the basin must be a
minimum of four feet above the seasonal high groundwater for
residential developments. For other development, infiltration
measures may be used on a case-by-case basis only, to avoid
pollution of groundwater. Complete infiltration must occur
within 72 hours.
(d) In retention ponds, the water quality requirements shall be
satisfied if the volume of the permanent pond is at least three
times the volume of runoff produced by the water quality
design storm.

equipment, side slopes greater than five feet in height shall be
no steeper than four horizontal to one vertical. Side slopes less
than five feet high should not exceed three horizontal to one
vertical.
(b) The minimum top width of the embankment shall be 10 feet.
(c) The minimum elevation to the top of the settled embankment
shall be one foot above the water surface in the detention basin
with the emergency spillway at the maximum design flow or a
minimum of two feet above the crest of the emergency
spillway, whichever is higher.
(3) Outlet structures.
(a) Multiple-level outlets or other fully automatic outlets shall be
designed so that discharge rates from the development for all
design storms will not be increased over existing conditions.
(b) The discharged water shall not cause erosion or other damage.
(c) Outlets shall be designed to function without manual, electric
or mechanical controls.
(d) Outlet orifice and weir plates should be constructed from
aluminum or other lightweight, noncorrodible materials. The

removable fasteners. A gasket of neoprene or similar material
should be placed between the plate and the structure wall. The
opening in the structure wall, over which the plat is bolted,
should have at least twice the area of the outlet orifice or weir.
(e) To facilitate access and movement by maintenance personnel,
principal outlet structures should have a minimum horizontal
interior dimension of four feet.
(f) To facilitate cleaning, trash racks should be comprised
primarily of sloping bars aligned longitudinally (in the
direction of flow). Perpendicular bars, aligned transverse to
the direction of flow, should be added for strength and rigidity.
In general, longitudinal bars shall be spaced a distance equal
to 1/2 the diameter of the outlet orifice or 1/2 the width or
height (whichever is less) of the outlet weir. Minimum and
maximum spacings of two inches and six inches on center,

minimum design storm frequency shall be 25 years.
(2) Velocity restrictions. Velocities in closed conduits, at design flow,
should be at least 2.5 feet per second, but not more than the
velocity which will cause erosion damage to the conduit. Velocities
in open channels, at design flow, shall not be less than 1.5 feet per
second and not greater than two feet per second for unlined earth
channels.
(3) At transitions between closed conduits and open channels or
different types of open channels, suitable provisions must be made
to accommodate the velocity transitions.
A. The developer shall, prior to final acceptance, install all traffic control
devices required within any development or, with the consent of the

§ 120-22.16. Building requirements. [Added 5-22-2019 by Ord. No.
2019-03]
A. Prior to a building permit being issued for any new building, building
addition, or building alteration that involves construction of a new
foundation for any use, the owner shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction
of the Borough Engineer, that any subsurface floor is at an elevation of a
minimum of two feet above the seasonal high water table (SHWT) and
that no footing drain or under-drain system shall be less than two feet
above the SHWT. For the purpose of this section, "subsurface" shall be
defined as any part of a building that is below existing grade.
B. The SHWT elevation shall be certified by a licensed professional
engineer as described in N.J.A.C. 7:9A-5.8. Profile pits are required at
the location of the proposed foundation. One profile pit per 5,000
square feet of building footprint area is required.
C. Profile pits shall be provided as described in N.J.A.C. 7:9A-5.8(e), as
follows:
(1) Profile pits shall be excavated, if possible, to a minimum depth of
10 feet below the existing ground surface or to solid bedrock,
where encountered. If the profile pit becomes unstable due to lack
of soil cohesion or the presence of groundwater, or both, the pit
may be terminated at a depth less than 10 feet, and soil evaluation
below the depth of the pit may be carried out by means of three or
more soil borings, performed as prescribed in N.J.A.C. 7:9-5.8(f).
The depth of the soil evaluation shall never be less than two feet
below the proposed lowest subsurface floor elevation.
(2) It is recommended that persons performing soil evaluation not
enter into portions of a soil profile pit which have been excavated to
depths greater than five feet below the surrounding ground
surface. It is the responsibility of persons performing or witnessing
soil evaluation to comply with all applicable federal, state and local
laws and regulations governing occupational safety.
(3) In soil profile pits and borings, the following characteristics of each
recognizable soil horizon or substratum (not including rock
substrata) shall be determined:
(a) Depth and thickness of horizon;
(b) Soil color, using the Munsell system of classification, which
includes an alphanumeric symbol together with a descriptive
color name;
(c) Estimated soil textural class, using the USDA system of
classification;
(d) Estimated volume percentage of coarse fragment, if present;
(e) Abundance, size and contrast of mottles, if present;
§ 120-22.16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-22.16
1:517
(f) Soil structural class (soil profile pits only); and
(g) Soil consistence.
(4) Terminology for soil logs shall be as described in N.J.A.C. 7:9A-5.3.
Alternate methods may be used as approved by the Borough
Engineer.
D. Profile pits and soil borings are required to be witnessed by the
Borough. A notice of not less than 48 hours shall be provided. A witness
fee of $300 per profile pit or soil boring is required.
E. The elevation of the SHWT shall be determined as described in N.J.A.C.
7:9A-5.8 as follows:
(1) Where mottling is observed, at any season of the year, the SHWT
shall be taken as the highest level at which mottling is observed,
except when the water table is observed at a level higher than the
level of the mottling.
(2) Where mottling is not observed, the SHWT shall be determined
based upon either of the following methods:
(a) During the months of January through April, inclusive, water
levels may be measured directly within soil profile pits or
borings. Whenever the Borough determines that there has
been a significant departure from normal climatic conditions,
the Borough may, with due notice to the administrative
authority, lengthen or shorten the period allowed for direct
measurement during any given year. In low-lying coastal areas
where groundwater levels fluctuate with the tides,
measurements shall be taken at the time of highest
groundwater elevation in response to tidal fluctuation; or
(b) During other times of the year, the depth to the SHWT may be
obtained from the Soil Conservation Service County Soil
Survey Report, provided that the soil series present at the site
is identified based upon comparison of soil profile morphology
observed within a soil profile pit, and the soil profile
description provided for the soil series in question within the
County Soil Survey Report. In cases where the SHWT is shown
as a range of elevations in the County Soil Survey Report, the
highest elevation of the range shall be used as the seasonal
high water table. The highest elevation determined by this
method shall be decreased by a factor of 1.5. For example, a
SHWT depth of six feet shall be reduced to four feet.
(3) When the determination of the SHWT must be made in disturbed
ground recognized as prescribed in N.J.A.C. 7:9A-5.10, direct
observation during the months of January through April, inclusive,
is the only method which shall be permitted.

184.1; Lot 10 in Block No. 183; Lot Nos. 1 and 7.01 in Block
179; and Lot No. 1 in Block 128.
B. Recommended features to be included.
(1) Gateways should announce entry into Kenilworth by incorporating
specific elements that create a "gateway scene." The composition
should function as a visual anchor and provide a sense of arrival,
reaffirm direction, and reinforce the identity of Kenilworth.
(2) The specific elements proposed for the "gateway scene" should
reflect the history and spirit of Kenilworth and include gateway
monumentation, fencing, decorative planting, and seasonal interest
plants. The design for each of the defined gateways may vary,
although the elements comprising the "gateway scene" should be
repeated to reinforce the concept of entry.
C. Signage. Gateway monumentation should be incorporated into the
design of the "gateway scene" at the primary gateways. Gateway

1:548
§ 120-23.16. Affordable Housing Overlay Zone. [Added 9-28-2016 by
Ord. No. 2016-07]
signage will need to be addressed in greater detail in a signage plan
and coordinated with the Planning Board, Borough Planner and
Borough Engineer for incorporation into the primary gateways. The
design for the monuments may vary at each gateway but should use the
same design vocabulary, color scheme, and graphics. The monuments
should be reflective of the character of the gateway, appropriately
scaled, and legible to motorists. [Amended at time of adoption of
Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
D. Fencing.
(1) Fencing should be an integral part of the "gateway scene" for all
the primary gateways. Fencing will help to define the gateways,
providing a backdrop that reflects the design vocabulary and
reinforces Kenilworth's identity. [Amended at time of adoption
of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
(2) The proposed fence design for the primary gateways may vary but
should incorporate forms, materials, and colors associated with a
formalized setting in wrought iron or similar materials that are
similar to fencing used in the region but unique enough to establish
an unquestionable identity.
E. Brick pavers. Brick masonry and paving is an element that is often
visually associated with the downtown historic buildings and the
Borough core. Incorporation of brick pavers in the design for the
primary gateways will reinforce their connection to downtown and help
orient the traveler.
F. Decorative planting. Landscape provides an opportunity to reinforce
Kenilworth's support of attractive features and the beauty of the
Borough, a feature that should be enforced and encouraged throughout
the Borough. Variations of the planting scheme will ultimately extend
throughout the Borough. Plant material, color, and forms should be
used to reinforce the unique character of each gateway. Each gateway
should be somewhat structured and formal. Plant material proposed for
the primary gateways should be selected to reflect seasonal change.
Ornamental shrubs, annuals, and perennials should be introduced to
emphasize entry, introduce the character of the corridor, and reinforce
Kenilworth's appreciation of the beauty of the landscape.
G. Public art. Gateways are the front door to the Borough and are prime
locations for public art because of the visual exposure they provide.
Public art helps to define gateways and the character of the Borough by
providing an image that travelers associate with. Public art should be
incorporated into the primary gateways either as part of the design for
the gateway monuments or in separate piece of work.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this zone district is to provide a realistic
opportunity for the construction of low- and moderate-income housing
as land becomes available for development and redevelopment in the
Borough of Kenilworth, thereby addressing some of the constitutional
housing obligations of the Borough under New Jersey's Fair Housing
Act, N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et seq., the rules of the New Jersey Council on
Affordable Housing ("COAH"), N.J.A.C. 5:94, and the Mount Laurel
doctrine.
B. Scope of applicability. This overlay zone shall apply to all of the land
area, excluding lands in Zone Districts G, P, CE, and CS, of the Borough
of Kenilworth.
C. Low- and moderate-income housing requirements. Neither the Planning
Board nor the Borough Council on an appeal of a final decision of the
Planning Board or the Borough Council in adopting and implementing a
redevelopment plan shall approve a development application in any
zone district or area in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation for a
residential development or a mixed use development with four or more
dwelling units unless 20% of the total number of dwelling units
developed at the same site of the development application are set aside
and sold or rented to low- and moderate-income households, as defined
by COAH, in accordance with applicable COAH rules, currently codified
at N.J.A.C. 5:94, as may be amended from time to time. Alternatively, at
the discretion of the approving agency, up to 50% of the required
number of affordable units may be developed off site, according to a
schedule and strategy acceptable to the approving agency. All fractional
obligations shall be rounded to the closest whole number. Any deviation
from these requirements shall be at the sole discretion of the approving
agency. [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. II)]

spaces required or provided, the following general provisions shall
apply:
§ 120-27.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-27.4
1:567
(1) Change of use. A change of use or modification of utilization shall
be subject to the required number of parking spaces for the new
use or utilization. Anything in this chapter to the contrary
notwithstanding, approval shall be valid only for the particular
utilization for which it was granted.
(2) More than one utilization. When one or more utilizations are
proposed on one lot, the minimum number of parking spaces shall
be the aggregate of the number of parking spaces required for each
utilization, computed separately for each utilization and summed,
unless specified otherwise herein.
(3) Primary and minor utilizations. If the primary utilization includes
minor elements of other types of utilizations (e.g., as with home
occupations or as with an office associated with a nursing home),
the entire parking required shall be calculated based on the
requirements from the primary utilization.
(4) Basement space. If basement space is used as part of the primary
utilization of the building either as a result of being a permitted use
or by variance or by meeting the requirements of a preexisting
nonconforming use, such basement space shall be included in
determining the number of parking spaces to be provided based on
the aforesaid requirements. Basement space which is vacant, used
to contain utility equipment serving the building or for storage
alone shall not be included in the calculation of basement space
being used.
(5) Fractions of spaces. Requirements for a fraction of a parking or
loading space shall be rounded down if the fraction is 1/2 space or
less and rounded up if the fraction is greater than 1/2 space.
(6) Garage parking. Parking spaces located inside garages shall be
counted toward the number of required parking spaces only if they
are included as such on a parking plan. Garaging as an accessory
use capable of storing motor vehicles shall not be designed or used
to store more than two motor vehicles on a single lot in any
residential zone district.
B. Minimum number of parking spaces required for each utilization. Each
utilization of land shall provide off-street parking in accordance with
the following requirements, unless more stringent requirements are
provided in other articles of this chapter.

§ 120-28.2. Wireless telecommunications towers and antennas.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish guidelines for the
siting of wireless communications towers and antennas.
B. Goals. The Borough shall give due consideration to the Master Plan,
Zoning Map, existing land uses and environmentally sensitive areas in
approving sites for the location of towers and antennas in order to
effectuate the following goals:
(1) Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers and antennas;
(2) Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential zones;
(3) Minimize the total number of towers throughout the Borough;
(4) Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as
a primary option rather than construction of additional single use
towers;
(5) Encourage users of towers and antenna to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the Borough
is minimal;
(6) Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and
antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and
innovative camouflaging techniques;
(7) Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide such services to the Borough quickly, effectively, and
efficiently;
109. Editor's Note: The definitions of "alternative tower structure," "FAA," "FCC," "height,"
"preexisting towers and antennas" and "towers," which were previously included in this
section, were repealed at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).

antennas shall not be required to meet the requirements of this
section, absent any enlargement or structural modification or the
addition of any structures.
(4) AM array. For purposes of implementing this section, an AM array,
consisting of one or more tower units and supporting ground
system which functions as one AM Broadcasting antenna, shall be
considered one tower. Measurements for setbacks and separation
distances shall be measured from the outer perimeter of the towers
included in the AM array. Additional tower units may be added
within the perimeter of the AM array by right.
(5) Satellite dish antennas. This section shall not govern any satellite
dish antennas.
(6) All towers and antennas shall be required to receive site plan
approval and a conditional use permit from the Planning Board,

either principal or accessory uses. Notwithstanding any other
section of this chapter, a different existing structure on the same lot
shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such
lot. If a tower and its appurtenant structures constitute the sole use
of the lot, the tower shall be deemed to be the principal use.
(2) Lot size. For the purposes of determining whether the installation
of a tower or antenna complies with this chapter, including but not
§ 120-28.2 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-28.2
1:576
limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements and
other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall
control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on
leased parcels within such lot.
(3) Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or
tower shall provide to the Zoning Officer an inventory of its existing
towers, antennas, or sites approved for tower or antennas, that are
either within the jurisdiction of the Borough or within three miles
of the borders thereof, including specific information about the
location, height and design of each tower. The Zoning Officer may
share such information with other applicants applying for
administrative approvals or permits under this section or other
organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of
the Borough; provided, however, that the Zoning Office is not, by
sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting
that such sites are available or suitable.
(4) Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following
requirements:
(a) Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or,
subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a
neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(b) At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related
structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors,
textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend them into
the natural setting and surrounding buildings.
(c) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment
must be of a neutral color that is identical to or closely
compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to
make the antenna and related equipment as visually
unobtrusive as possible.
(d) Under no circumstances shall a wireless telecommunications
tower, antenna, or any appurtenance be situated so that the
same is within 200 feet and facing the front door of any
residence on property adjacent to the proposed
telecommunications facility. [Amended at time of adoption
of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
(5) Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by
the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the
lighting alternatives and design chosen must cause the least
disturbance to the surrounding views.
(6) State or federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed
current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any
other agency of the state or federal government with the authority
§ 120-28.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-28.2
1:577
to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations
are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed
by this section shall bring such towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six
months of the effective date of such standards and regulations,
unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the
controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring towers and
antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or
antenna at the owner's expense.
(7) Building codes: safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity
of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local
building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are
published by the Electronic Industries Association as amended
from time to time. If, upon inspection, the Borough concludes that a
tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and
constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being
provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to
bring such tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to
bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days shall
constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the
owner's expense.
(8) Not essential services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this section and shall not be regulated or
permitted as essential services, public utilities or private utilities.
(9) Franchises. Owners and/or operators of towers or antennas shall
certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/
or operation of a wireless communication system in the Borough
have been obtained and shall file a copy of all required franchises
with the appropriate Zoning Officer.
(10) Public notice. For purposes of this section, any conditional use
request, variance request or appeal of an administratively
approved use or conditional use shall require public notice to all
abutting property owners and all property owners of properties
that are located within 200 feet, in addition to any notice otherwise
required by this chapter.
(11)No signs, except for identification and warning signs, shall be
allowed on an antenna or tower.
(12) Buildings and support equipment. Buildings and support
equipment associated with antennas or towers shall comply with
the requirements of Article 28.
(13) Multiple antenna/tower plan. The Borough encourages and
mandates the users of towers and antennas to co-locate antennas.
§ 120-28.2 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-28.2
1:578
Applications for approval of co-location sites shall be given priority
in the review process.
(14) Municipal emergency services communications equipment. Any
telecommunications tower constructed or erected in the Borough
must be able to accommodate Borough emergency services,
including but not limited to police, fire and rescue squad, antennas.
Adjacent space to accommodate supporting equipment shall also
be provided. Any costs associated with such accommodation shall
be borne by the owner of such tower. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such requirement may be waived by the Borough if such
accommodation is not needed by the Borough emergency services
departments.
E. Permitted uses.
(1) General. The uses listed hereafter are deemed to be permitted uses
and shall not require administrative approval or a conditional use
permit.
(2) Permitted uses. The following use is specifically permitted:
antennas or towers located on property owned, leased, or
otherwise controlled by the Borough, provided a license or lease
authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the
Borough. Notwithstanding the foregoing, telecommunications
towers shall not be permitted at any Borough park; however, the
Borough may, as a condition of such lease, require site plan
approval. The decision to extend such lease(s) to an applicant shall
be vested solely with the Borough and shall not be governed by this
section.
F. Conditional use permits.
(1) List of conditional uses. The following uses may be approved by the
Board as conditional uses and a conditional use permit issued:
(a) Antennas on existing structures or towers consistent with the
terms of Subsections F(1)(a)[1][a] and [b] below:
[1] Antennas on existing structures. Any antenna which is not
attached to a tower may be attached to any existing
business, industrial, office or institutional structure not
located in a residential zone, provided:
[a] The antenna does not extend more than the maximum
building height for the zone wherein the structure is
located;
[b] The antenna complies with all applicable FCC and FAA
regulations; and
[c] The antenna complies with the Uniform Construction
Code and the Fire Safety Code.
§ 120-28.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-28.2
1:579
(2) Antennas on existing towers. An antenna may be attached to an
existing tower in a nonresidential zone and, to minimize adverse
visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of
towers, co-location of antennas by more than one carrier on
existing towers shall take precedence over the construction of new
towers, provided such co-location is accomplished in a manner
consistent with the following:
(a) A tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate
the co-location of an additional antenna shall be of the same
tower type as the existing towers.
(b) Height.
[1] An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller
height, not to exceed the maximum tower height
established by this section.
[2] The height change referred to in Subsection F(2)(b)[1]
may only occur one time per communication tower.
[3] The additional height referred to in Subsection F(2)(b)[1]
shall not require an additional distance separation as set
forth in Article 28. The tower's premodification height
shall be used to calculate such distance separations.
(c) On-site location.
[1] A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the colocation
of an additional antenna may be moved on site
within 50 feet of its existing location.
[2] After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate co-location, only
one tower may remain on the site.
[3] A relocated on-site tower shall continue to be measured
from the original tower location for purposes of calculating
separation distances between towers pursuant to
§ 120-28.2F(5). The relocation of a tower hereunder shall
in no way be deemed to cause a violation of § 120-28.2F(5).
(d) New towers. New towers may be constructed to hold antennas.
In addition to any information required for applications for
conditional use permits pursuant to this chapter, applicants for
a conditional use permit for a tower shall submit the following

(3) Factors considered in granting conditional use permits for towers.
In addition to any standards for consideration of conditional use
permit applications pursuant to this chapter, the Board shall
consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a
conditional use permit.
(a) Height of the proposed tower;
(b) Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;
(c) Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
(d) Surrounding topography;
(e) Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
(f) Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating
visual obtrusiveness;
(g) Proposed ingress and egress;
(h) Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or
structures as discussed in § 120-28.2F(4); and
(i) Availability of proposed tower to other potential users.
(4) Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless the
applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board
that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does
not require the use of towers or structures can accommodate the
applicant's proposed antenna. An applicant shall submit
information requested by the Board related to the availability of
suitable existing towers, other structures or alternative technology.
Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower,
structure or alternative technology can accommodate the
applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following
(although meeting one, some, or all of the following shall entitle the
applicant to approval):
(a) No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area which meet applicant's engineering
requirements.
(b) Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet applicant's engineering requirements.
§ 120-28.2 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-28.2
1:582
(c) Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related
equipment.
(d) The applicant's proposed antenna would cause
electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing
tower or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or
structures would cause interference with the applicant's
proposed antenna.
(e) The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner
in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an
existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs
exceeding new tower development are presumed to be
unreasonable.
(f) The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
(g) The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a
cable micro cell network using multiple low powered
transmitters/receivers attached to a wire line system, is
suitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new
tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render
the technology unsuitable.
(5) Setbacks. The following minimum setback requirements shall apply
to all towers for which a conditional use permit is required:
(a) Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least 100% of
the height of the tower from any adjoining lot line and all
nonappurtenant buildings.
(b) Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning
district setback requirements.
(c) No tower shall exist within required buffer areas, if adjacent to
residential zones and as prescribed elsewhere in this chapter.
(d) Towers located in nonresidential districts adjacent to
residential districts shall be set back from all residential lot
lines by a minimum distance equal to 1 1/2 times the height of
the tower, including all antennas and attachments, or a fivehundred-
foot minimum setback, whichever is more.
(e) Towers shall not be located between a principal structure and a
public street. An improved driveway shall be provided for
access to each tower site from the nearest open public street.
(f) A tower's setback may be reduced or its location in relation to
the public street varied, at the sole discretion of the Board, to
allow the integration of a tower into an existing or proposed
§ 120-28.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-28.2
1:583
structure, such as a church steeple, light standard, power line
support device, or similar structure.
(g) Towers shall meet all buffer and landscaping requirements of
the underlying zone district.
(h) Telecommunications towers or antennas shall not be located on
any dwelling.
(6) Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not
less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an
appropriate anti-climbing device.
(7) Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the
landscaping surrounding towers for which a conditional use permit
is required:
(a) Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screens the view of the tower
compound from property used for residences or planned
residences. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped
strip at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the
compound.
(b) In locations where the visual impact of the tower is minimal,
the landscaping requirement may be reduced.
(c) Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some
cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural
growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer.
(d) Height. The maximum height of a new tower shall be:
[1] For single user, up to 90 feet in height;
[2] For two users, up to 120 feet in height;
[3] For three or more users up to 150 in height.
(8) General requirements. The following provisions shall govern the
issuance of conditional use permits for towers or antennas by the
Board:
(a) If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under
§ 120-28.2E, then a conditional use permit shall be required for
the construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in
designated zoning districts.
(b) Applications for conditional use permits under this section
shall be subject to the procedures and requirements contained
elsewhere in this chapter, except as modified by this section.
§ 120-28.2 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-28.2
1:584
(c) In granting a conditional use permit, the Board may impose
conditions to the extent the Board concludes such conditions
are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed
tower on adjoining properties.
(d) Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant
submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be
certified by a licensed professional engineer.
(e) An applicant for a conditional use permit shall submit the
information described in this section and a nonrefundable
application fee and an escrow deposit as required by this
chapter for conditional use applications.
(f) Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of
additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in
connection with said tower or antenna, is permitted as
conditional uses only in the Industrial Zone and the G
Government Zone. [Amended at time of adoption of Code
(see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
(g) An application fee and escrows shall be paid as required by the
Borough.
G. Buildings or other equipment storage.
(1) Antennas mounted on structures or rooftops. The equipment
cabinet or structure used in association with antennas shall comply
with the following:
(a) The cabinet or structure shall not contain more than 200
square feet of gross floor area or be more than 10 feet in

of eight feet and a planted height of at least six feet.
H. Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. Any antenna or tower that
is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be
considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall
remove the same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the Borough
notifying the owner of such abandonment. Failure to remove an
abandoned antenna or tower within said 90 days shall be grounds to
remove the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. If there are two or
more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become
effective until all users cease using the tower. The Borough may
condition the issuance of any permit to demolish or remove a tower or
antenna on the posting of an appropriate performance bond or other
suitable guarantee in a face amount of not less than 120% of the cost
(as determined by the Borough Engineer) of such removal, grading and
restoration to a state required under the Borough Code, including but
not limited to the Borough Property Maintenance Code.
I. Rebuilding damaged or destroyed nonconforming towers and antennas.
Nonconforming towers or antennas that are damaged or destroyed may
not be rebuilt without first obtaining a conditional use permit. The type,
height and location of the tower on site shall be of the same type and
intensity as the original facility approval. Building permits to rebuild
the facility shall comply with the then applicable building codes and
shall be obtained within 180 days from the date the facility is damaged
or destroyed. If no permit is obtained or if said permit expires, the
tower or antenna shall be deemed abandoned.
§ 120-28.2 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-28.3
1:586
A. Review and approval procedure. All antennas shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Zoning Officer. Applications shall be subject
to the following procedure:
(1) Each application shall be accompanied by a report prepared by the
installer of the antenna explaining why the proposed location was
selected over other locations and the reasons, with supporting
data, for any requested deviation from the requirements of this
section as to location or screening.
(2) When deemed necessary by the Zoning Officer, the Borough may
consult, at the applicant's expense, with an expert in the field of
antenna installations for guidance in evaluating an applicant's
report when a deviation from the requirements of this section is
requested. The applicant shall post a fee calculated by the Zoning
Officer, but not to exceed $500, to cover such expense, in the form
of cash or a certified check, and against which such review
expenses shall be charged. All sums not actually so expended shall
be returned to the applicant at the time the permit is either issued
or denied.
(3) The Zoning Officer may permit deviations from the requirements of
this section when it is demonstrated by the applicant that such
deviations are necessary to enable proper antenna reception.
B. General regulations. The following general regulations shall apply to
antennas in residential or nonresidential districts.
(1) No portion of an antenna array shall extend beyond the property
lines or into any front yard area. Guy wires shall not be anchored
within any front yard area but may be attached to the building.
(2) Ground-mounted antennas shall be any antenna with its base
mounted directly in the ground, even if such antenna is supported
or attached to the wall of a building. Fixed-guyed antenna tower
shall be fascia-mounted or guyed according to approved standards.
Wire antennas that are not self-supporting shall be supported by
objects within the property lines but not within any front yard
areas.
(3) The antenna, including guy wires, supporting structures and
accessory equipment, shall be located and designed so as to
minimize to the greatest extent possible the visual impact on
surrounding properties and from public streets. Antennas shall be
screened from view through the addition of anti-climb fencing and
architectural features or evergreen landscaping that harmonizes
with the elements and characteristics of the property; provided,
however, that no screening shall be required which would inhibit
adequate reception. Screening by fencing or plantings may be
waived if natural terrain and landscaping provide adequate
screening. The materials used in constructing the antenna shall not
§ 120-28.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-28.3
1:587
be unnecessarily bright, shiny, garish or reflective, and all antennas
shall blend with the surrounding environment.
(4) Antennas shall meet all manufacturers specifications. The mast or
tower shall be of noncombustible and noncorrosive hardware, such
as brackets, turn buckles, clips and similar type equipment not
subject to rust or corrosion, and shall be protected with a zinc or
cadmium coating by either galvanizing or a similar process after
forming. These finishes are selected to guard against corrosion and
to protect the element against electrolytic action due to the use of
adjoining dissimilar metals. [Amended at time of adoption of
Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
(5) Power control and signal cables to or from the antenna shall be by
underground conduit.
(6) All antennas shall be located, designed, constructed, treated and
maintained in compliance with the requirements of the Uniform
Construction Code and the requirements set forth below. The
requirements below have been designed with the intent of
advancing and achieving health, safety and aesthetic interests and
objectives and are further intended to operate so as not to impose
unreasonable limitations on, or prevent, reception of satellite
delivered signals or to impose costs on the users which are
excessive in light of the cost of purchase and installation.
(7) No antenna or antenna structure located in the Borough,
regardless of when it was erected, shall be used as a sign or as a
supporting structure for any sign or lettering.
C. Antennas in residential districts. Antennas in the residential districts
shall be subject to the following additional regulations:
(1) No lot shall contain more than two antennas, not more than one of
which may be a satellite dish antenna.
(2) Antennas shall be located in the rear yard only and shall be located
at least 10 feet from any property line.
(3) Roof-mounted antennas of any type shall not extend higher than
five feet above the highest point of the roof, provided the satellite
dish antennas shall not be permitted on the roof unless necessary
for reception. In such instances, no roof-mounted satellite dish
antenna shall exceed three feet in diameter nor extend higher than
six feet above the highest point of the roof. A roof-mounted satellite
dish antenna shall be of mesh construction. Such satellite dish
antenna shall be located, if reception is possible at such location,
on roofs when the satellite dish is shielded from view from the
street or by other portions of the roof or structure.
(4) Ground-mounted accessory antennas of any type shall not extend
higher than 50 feet above adjacent ground level, except that
§ 120-28.3 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-28.3
1:588
ground-mounted satellite dish antennas shall not exceed three feet
in diameter nor five feet in height.
D. Antennas in nonresidential districts. Antennas in the nonresidential
districts shall be subject to the following additional regulations.
(1) Antennas shall be located in the rear yard and shall be located at
least 10 feet from any property line.
(2) An antenna may be erected on the roof of a building, provided that
the building, including the antenna, falls within the height limits
established for the district, provided that satellite dish antennas
subject to this article shall not be permitted on the roof.
(3) Ground-mounted antennas shall not exceed five feet in height,
provided that no ground-mounted dish antenna shall exceed a
diameter of 16 feet nor extend above the ground more than 18 feet.

§ 120-34.1. Scope and purpose.
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural BMPs.112 Structural BMPs should
be integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies
and proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater
recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for "major
development," as defined in § 120-34.2.
C. Applicability.
(1) This article shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for
the following major developments that require preliminary or final
site plan or subdivision review:
(a) Nonresidential major developments; and
(b) Aspects of residential major developments that are not
preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) This article shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the Borough of Kenilworth.
D. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant
to this article are to be considered an integral part of development
approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule,
act, or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this article shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
112. Editor's Note: "BMP" refers to best management practice.

existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance with the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements of § 120-34.4F and G may be obtained for the
enlargement of an existing public roadway or railroad, or the
construction or enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided
that the following conditions are met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
§ 120-34.3 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-34.4
1:620
(2) The applicant demonstrates, through an alternatives analysis, that

management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of § 120-34.4F and G to the
maximum extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of § 120-34.4F and G, existing structures currently in use, such as
homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above,
within the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream that
would provide additional opportunities to mitigate the
requirements of § 120-34.4F and G that were not achievable on
site.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in § 120-34.4F
and G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth at § 120-34.4E into the design.
The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures
incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant
contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental, or
safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater
management measures identified in Subsection E(2) below into the

particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss.
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces.
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation.
(d) Minimize the decrease in the time of concentration from
preconstruction to postconstruction. "Time of concentration" is

discharging into and through stable vegetated areas.
(i) Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site, in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
[1] Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that satisfy § 120-34.4E(3) below;
[2] Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash
and debris from drainage systems;
[3] Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain
spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and
[4] When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
(3) Site design features identified under § 120-34.4E(2)(i)[2] above

(a) Grates.
[1] Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a
storm drain or surface water body under that grate:
[a] The New Jersey Department of Transportation
(NJDOT) bicycle safe grate, which is described in
Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible
Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidelines (April 1996); or
[b] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square
inches, or is no greater than 0.5 inch across the
smallest dimension.
§ 120-34.4 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-34.4
1:622
[2] Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer
bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces
include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways,
parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields,
open channels, and stormwater basin floors.
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches, or be no greater
than two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in § 120-34.4G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end of pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch;
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in § 120-34.4G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in § 120-34.4F and G
shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate County Clerk's
office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
§ 120-34.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-34.4
1:623
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 120-34.7, or found on the Department's
website at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 120-34.5, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area, or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
§ 120-34.4 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-34.4
1:624
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with a Department-approved remedial action work
plan or landfill closure plan; and areas with high risks
for spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or machinery
located at an industrial facility that is directly or
indirectly related to process, manufacturing or other
industrial activities, which could be a source of
pollutants in any industrial stormwater discharge to
groundwater. Source materials include, but are not
limited to, raw materials; intermediate products; final
products; waste materials; by-products; industrial
machinery and fuels; and lubricants, solvents, and
detergents that are related to process, manufacturing,
or other industrial activities that are exposed to
stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surface ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 120-34.5, complete one of
the following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
§ 120-34.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-34.4
1:625
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten-, and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at § 120-34.2 et seq., shall be
submitted to the appropriate Soil Conservation District for review
and approval in accordance with the requirements of this section
and any applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for
stormwater runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of
this section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,
expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of
rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
§ 120-34.4 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-34.4
1:626
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

BMP.
§ 120-34.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-34.4
1:627
B = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the
second BMP.
(2) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the 80% TSS
removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the runoff
from the subareas converge on site, in which case the removal rate
can be demonstrated through a calculation using a weighted
average.
(3) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in § 120-34.4F and G.
(4) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 120-34.7.
(5) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(6) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC 14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession.
§ 120-34.4 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-34.4
1:628
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(6)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or center
line of the waterway where the bank is undefined. All
encroachments proposed under this subsection shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under
the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et
seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under the Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a 95% TSS postconstruction removal
rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
§ 120-34.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-34.4
1:629
§ 120-34.5. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to Subsection G(6) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
G(6) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in Subsection G(6)(a) above. In no case shall a
stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
special water resource protection area to less than 150 feet as
measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Subsection G(6) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4, Hydrology, and
Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds;
or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at § 120-34.5A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at § 120-34.5A(1)(b). A runoff
§ 120-34.4 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-34.5
1:630
§ 120-34.6. Standards for structural stormwater management
measures.
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption
prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover has
existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the
time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the
presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the
land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the
land use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and
conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32, A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual; at

(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas; wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of § 120-34.8B.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosion
resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
5:21-7.4, and 5:21-7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
§ 120-34.8.
B. Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
stormwater management measures may be utilized, provided the
design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its
design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater
recharge and water quality design and performance standards
established by § 120-34.4 of this article.
C. Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements
of § 120-34.4 of this article, provided the pollutant removal rates are
verified by the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and
certified by the Department.

A. This section sets forth requirements to protect public safety through
the proper design and operation of stormwater management basins.
This section applies to any new stormwater management basin. [Note
to the applicant: The provisions of this section are not intended to
preempt more stringent municipal or county safety requirements for
new or existing stormwater management basins. Municipal and county
stormwater management plans and ordinances may, pursuant to their
authority, require existing stormwater management basins to be
retrofitted to meet one or more of the safety standards in Subsection
B(1), (2) and (3) for trash racks, overflow grates, and escape provisions
at outlet structures.]
B. Requirements for trash racks, overflow grates and escape provisions.
§ 120-34.7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-34.8
1:633
(1) A trash rack is a device designed to catch trash and debris and
prevent the clogging of outlet structures. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet from the stormwater
management basin to ensure proper functioning of the basin
outlets in accordance with the following:
(a) The trash rack shall have parallel bars, with no greater than
six-inch spacing between the bars.
(b) The trash rack shall be designed so as not to adversely affect
the hydraulic performance of the outlet pipe or structure.
(c) The average velocity of flow through a clean trash rack is not to
exceed 2.5 feet per second under the full range of stage and
discharge. Velocity is to be computed on the basis of the net
area of opening through the rack.
(d) The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be rigid,
durable, and corrosion resistant, and shall be designed to
withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(2) An overflow grate is designed to prevent obstruction of the
overflow structure. If an outlet structure has an overflow grate,
such grate shall meet the following requirements:
(a) The overflow grate shall be secured to the outlet structure but
removable for emergencies and maintenance.
(b) The overflow grate spacing shall be no less than two inches
across the smallest dimension.
(c) The overflow grate shall be constructed and installed to be
rigid, durable, and corrosion resistant, and shall be designed to
withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(3) For purposes of this Subsection B(3), "escape provisions" means
the permanent installation of ladders, steps, rungs, or other
features that provide easily accessible means of egress from
stormwater management basins. Stormwater management basins
shall include escape provisions as follows:
(a) If a stormwater management basin has an outlet structure,
escape provisions shall be incorporated in or on the structure.
With the prior approval of the reviewing agency identified in
Subsection C, a freestanding outlet structure may be exempted
from this requirement.
(b) Safety ledges shall be constructed on the slopes of all new
stormwater management basins having a permanent pool of
water deeper than 2 1/2 feet. Such safety ledges shall be
comprised of two steps. Each step shall be four to six feet in

the permanent water surface, and the second step shall be
located one to 1 1/2 feet above the permanent water surface.
(c) In new stormwater management basins, the maximum interior
slope for an earthen dam, embankment, or berm shall not be
steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
C. Variance or exemption from safety standards. A variance or exemption
from the safety standards for stormwater management basins may be
granted only upon a written finding by the appropriate reviewing
agency (municipality, county or Department) that the variance or
exemption will not constitute a threat to public safety.
A. Submission of site development stormwater plan.
(1) Whenever an applicant seeks municipal approval of a development
subject to this article, the applicant shall submit all of the required
components of the checklist for the site development stormwater
plan at § 120-34.9C below as part of the submission of the

B. Site development stormwater plan approval. The applicant's site
development project shall be reviewed as a part of the subdivision or
site plan review process by the municipal board or official from whom
municipal approval is sought. That municipal board or official shall
consult the engineer retained by the Planning Board to determine if all
of the checklist requirements have been satisfied and to determine if
the project meets the standards set forth in this article. [Amended at
time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
C. Checklist requirements. The following information shall be required:
(1) Topographic base map. The reviewing engineer may require
upstream tributary drainage system information as necessary. It is
recommended that the topographic base map of the site be

permanent structures. The map(s) shall also clearly show areas
where alterations occur in the natural terrain and cover,
including lawns and other landscaping, and seasonal high
groundwater elevations.
(b) A written description of the site plan and justification of
proposed changes in natural conditions may also be provided.
(4) Land use planning and source control plan. This plan shall provide
a demonstration of how the goals and standards of §§ 120-34.3
through 120-34.6 are being met. The focus of this plan shall be to
describe how the site is being developed to meet the objective of
controlling groundwater recharge, stormwater quality and
stormwater quantity problems at the source by land management
and source controls whenever possible.
(5) Stormwater management facilities map. The following information,
illustrated on a map of the same scale as the topographic base map,
shall be included:

(a) Comprehensive hydrologic and hydraulic design calculations
for the predevelopment and postdevelopment conditions for
the design storms specified in § 120-34.4 of this article.
(b) When the proposed stormwater management control measures
(e.g., infiltration basins) depend on the hydrologic properties
of soils, then a soils report shall be submitted. The soils report
shall be based on on-site boring logs or soil pit profiles. The
number and location of required soil borings or soil pits shall
be determined based on what is needed to determine the
suitability and distribution of soils present at the location of the
control measure.
(7) Maintenance and repair plan. The design and planning of the
stormwater management facility shall meet the maintenance
requirements of § 120-34.10.
(8) Waiver from submission requirements. The municipal official or
board reviewing an application under this article may, in
consultation with the Borough Engineer, waive submission of any of
the requirements in § 120-34.9C(1) through (6) of this article when
it can be demonstrated that the information requested is
impossible to obtain or it would create a hardship on the applicant
to obtain and its absence will not materially affect the review
process.
A. Applicability. Projects subject to review as in § 120-34.1 et seq., of this
article shall comply with the requirements of § 120-34.10B and C.
B. General maintenance.
(1) The design engineer shall prepare a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of
a major development.
(2) The maintenance plan shall contain specific preventative
maintenance tasks and schedules; cost estimates, including
estimated cost of sediment, debris, or trash removal; and the name,
address, and telephone number of the person or persons
responsible for preventative and corrective maintenance (including
replacement). Maintenance guidelines for stormwater
management measures are available in the New Jersey Stormwater
Best Management Practices Manual. If the maintenance plan
identifies a person other than the developer (for example, a public
agency or homeowners' association) as having the responsibility for
maintenance, the plan shall include documentation of such
person's agreement to assume this responsibility, or of the
§ 120-34.9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-34.10
1:637
developer's obligation to dedicate a stormwater management
facility to such person under an applicable ordinance or regulation.
(3) Responsibility for maintenance shall not be assigned or transferred
to the owner or tenant of an individual property in a residential
development or project, unless such owner or tenant owns or
leases the entire residential development or project.
(4) If the person responsible for maintenance identified under
Subsection B(2) above is not a public agency, the maintenance plan
and any future revisions based on Subsection B(7) below shall be
recorded upon the deed of record for each property on which the
maintenance described in the maintenance plan must be
undertaken.
(5) Preventative and corrective maintenance shall be performed to
maintain the function of the stormwater management measure,
including repairs or replacement to the structure; removal of
sediment, debris, or trash; restoration of eroded areas; snow and
ice removal; fence repair or replacement; restoration of vegetation;
and repair or replacement of nonvegetated linings.
(6) The person responsible for maintenance identified under

Affordable Housing
ARTICLE 35
Development Fees
[Added 9-28-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-08]
§ 120-35.1. When effective.
This article shall take effect upon approval by the Superior Court of the
State of New Jersey or appropriate state regulatory agency of the State of
New Jersey.
§ 120-35.2. Findings and purposes.
§ 120-35.3. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AFFORDABLE HOUSING  Any housing unit with an acquisition price or
rent level not exceeding the maximum resale or rent level for low- and
moderate-income housing as set forth in N.J.A.C. 5:94 et seq.
COAH  The New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing, established under
the Fair Housing Act of 1985,114 and which has primary jurisdiction for
the administration of low- and moderate-income housing obligations in
accordance with sound regional planning considerations in the state.
A. The New Jersey Supreme Court, in Holmdel Builders Ass'n v. Twp. of
Holmdel, 121 N.J. 550 (1990), determined that mandatory development
fees are both statutorily and constitutionally permissible. The Court
further anticipated that COAH would promulgate appropriate
development fee rules specifying, among other things, the standards for
these development fees. The purpose of this article is to provide such
rules pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:94 et seq.
B. The Borough Council finds and declares that the creation and
preservation of affordable housing in the Borough serves the public
interest. Maintaining and improving a stock of sound affordable
housing requires affirmative steps by local government working
cooperatively with public bodies at all levels and with the private sector.
The purpose of this article is to create in the Borough of Kenilworth a
trust fund from payment of development fees to assist in the marshaling
of public and private monies dedicated to affordable housing projects
and programs.
114. Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et seq.
§ 120-35.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-35.3
1:641
DEVELOPMENT FEES  Money paid by an individual, person, partnership,
association, company, or corporation for the improvement of property as
permitted in N.J.A.C. 5:94 et seq.
EQUALIZED ASSESSED VALUE  The value of a property determined
by the Borough Tax Assessor through a process designed to ensure that
all property in the Borough is assessed at the same assessment ratio or
ratios required by law. Estimates at the time of building permit may be
obtained by the Tax Assessor utilizing estimates for construction cost. Final
equalized assessed value will be determined at project completion by the
Tax Assessor.
SUBSTANTIVE CERTIFICATION  A determination by COAH approving
the Borough of Kenilworth's Housing Element and Fair Share Plan in
accordance with the provisions of the Fair Housing Act115 and the rules and
criteria as set forth therein. A grant of substantive certification shall be
valid for a period of 10 years in accordance with the terms and conditions
contained therein.
§ 120-35.4. Development fee schedule. [Amended at time of
adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
A. Residential development.
(1) Residential development fees shall be 1% of the equalized assessed
value for residential development within the OR Zone District,
which is not exempt from the provisions of this article as set forth
below, provided no increase in density is permitted.
(2) If a "D" variance is granted by the Borough of Kenilworth Planning
Board pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d(5), the additional residential
units realized (above what is permitted by right under the existing
zoning) will incur a bonus development fee of 6% rather than the
development fee of 1%. However, if the zoning on a site has
changed during the two-year period preceding the filing of the "D"
variance application, the base density for the purposes of
calculating the bonus development fee shall be the highest density
permitted by right during the two years preceding the filing with
the Borough of Kenilworth Planning Board of the "D" variance
application.
B. Nonresidential development.
(1) Nonresidential development fees shall be 2% of the equalized
assessed value for nonresidential development within the BD, AC,
C, OR and I Zone Districts, which is not exempt from the provisions
of this subsection as set forth in this article.
(2) If a "D" variance is granted by the Borough of Kenilworth Planning
Board, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d(4), then the additional floor

1:642
§ 120-35.5. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions.
§ 120-35.6. Collection of development fees.
The Borough shall collect 50% of the fee on any specific development prior
to and as a condition of the issuance of the building permit therefor. The
remaining portion shall be collected prior to and as a condition of the
issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Once the final equalized assessed
value of a particular development has been determined by the Tax Assessor,
area ration (FAR) realized (above what is permitted by right under
the existing zoning) will incur a bonus development fee of 6%
rather than the development fee of 2%. However, if the zoning on a
site has changed during the two-year period preceding the filing of
the "D" variance application, the base density for the purposes of
calculating the bonus development fee shall be the highest density
permitted by right during the two years preceding the filing with
the Borough of Kenilworth Planning Board of the "D" variance
application.
A. Except as provided in § 120-35.4A(2) above, developers of low- and
moderate-income units shall be exempt from development fees.
B. Development fees may only be collected for any residential structure
which requires the installation of a new foundation (excluding
foundations required for an addition to or renovation of an existing
residential structure or a foundation required for an accessory
structure to an existing residential structure).
C. All forms of new nonresidential construction shall be subject to
development fees; provided, however, that development fees may only
be collected for improvements which add usable or rentable footage to
an existing nonresidential structure. In the event that a development
fee is collected for a nonresidential structure and thereafter usable or
rentable footage is obtained through modification of the said structure,
a development fee may be collected for the additional usable or
rentable footage based upon the increase in the equalized assessed
value of the improved structure.
D. Developments that have received preliminary or final approval prior to
the adoption and final publication of this article shall be exempt from
development fees unless the developer seeks a substantial change in
the approval.
E. The Borough exempts the following types of development from
imposition of development fees:
(1) Development by the Borough or any of its instrumentalities; and
(2) Development by charitable or not-for-profit entities formed and
legally established in accordance with the laws of the State of New
Jersey.
§ 120-35.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-35.6
1:643
and such final equalized assessed value is greater than the estimated
equalized assessed value, the developer shall, within 10 business days from
receipt of notification from the Borough, pay to the Borough the difference
between the development fees required to be paid by the developer once
such final equalized assessed value has been determined and the estimated
development fees actually paid by the developer. The failure of the
developer to make timely payments of the aforesaid deficiency shall entitle
the Borough to file, without notice to the developer, a lien against the
subject development. In the event that the Borough shall file such lien, the
Borough may add to the aforesaid deficiency amount reasonable attorney
fees to file and discharge such lien, together with any and all costs incurred
to file and discharge said lien. In the event that the estimated equalized
assessed value proves to have been too high, the Borough shall promptly
refund the difference between the estimated development fees actually paid
by the developer and the development fees required to be paid by the
developer once such final equalized assessed value has been determined.
§ 120-35.7. Contested fees.
Imposed and collected development fees that are challenged shall be placed
in an interest-bearing escrow account by the Chief Financial Officer of
the Borough. If all or a portion of the contested fees are returned to
the developer, the accrued interest on the returned amount shall also be
returned.
§ 120-35.8. Housing trust fund.
All development fees shall be deposited with the Chief Financial Officer of
the Borough in a separate designated interest-bearing housing trust fund.
The development fees placed in the housing trust fund shall be deemed
"dedicated revenues" as such term is defined in N.J.S.A. 40A:4-36. In
establishing the housing trust fund, the Borough shall provide written
authorization in the form of a three-party escrow agreement between the
Borough, the bank and COAH to permit COAH to direct the disbursement of
the funds as provided for in N.J.A.C. 5:94-6.16(b). This three-party escrow
agreement shall be submitted to COAH within seven days from the opening
of the trust fund account. All interest accrued in the housing trust fund shall
only be used on eligible affordable housing activities approved by COAH.
§ 120-35.9. Use of money.
A. The Borough shall use revenues collected from development fees for
any activity approved by COAH for addressing the Borough's fair share
obligation. Such activities include, but are not limited to, rehabilitation,
new construction, regional contribution agreements, purchase of new
land for low- and moderate-income housing, improvement of land to be
used for low- and moderate-income housing, extension and/or
improvements of roads and infrastructure to low- and moderate-income
housing sites, assistance designed to render units to be more affordable
and administration of the implementation of the Housing Element and
§ 120-35.6 KENILWORTH CODE § 120-35.9
1:644
§ 120-35.10. Monitoring.
The Borough shall complete and return to COAH all monitoring forms
related to the collection of development fees, expenditures of revenues,
and implementation of the spending plan (discussed in § 120-35.11 below)
certified by COAH. Financial reports, annual program implementation, and
monitoring reports shall be completed by the Borough on forms designed by
COAH.
Fair Share Plan. The expenditure of all money shall conform to a
spending plan approved by COAH.
B. Funds shall not be expended to reimburse the Borough for past housing
activities.
C. After subtracting development fees collected to finance a regional
contribution agreement, a rehabilitation program or a new construction
project that are necessary to address the municipality's affordable
housing obligation, at least 30% of the balance remaining shall be used
to provide affordability assistance to low- and moderate-income
households in affordable units included in a municipal Fair Share Plan.
One-third of the affordability assistance portion of development fees
collected shall be used to provide affordability assistance to those
households earning 30% or less of median income by region.
(1) Affordability assistance programs may include down payment
assistance, security deposit assistance, low interest loans, and
rental assistance.
(2) Affordability assistance to households earning 30% or less of
median income may include buying down the cost of low-income
units in a municipal Fair Share Plan to make them affordable to
households earning 30% or less than median income. The use of
development fees in this manner shall entitle a municipality to
bonus credits pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:94-4.22.
(3) Payments in lieu of constructing affordable units on site and funds
from the sale of units with extinguished controls shall be exempt
from the affordability assistance requirement.
D. No more than 20% of the revenues collected from development fees
shall be expended on administration, including, but not limited to,
salaries and benefits for Borough employees or consultant fees
necessary to develop or implement a rehabilitation program, a new
construction program, a regional contribution agreement, a Housing
Element and Fair Share Plan, and an affirmative marketing program.
Administrative funds may be used for income qualification of
households, monitoring the turnover of sale and rental units, and
compliance with COAH's monitoring requirements. Development fees
shall not be used to defray the costs of existing staff.
§ 120-35.9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-35.11
1:645
§ 120-35.11. Spending plans.
The Borough shall submit to COAH a spending plan for the development
fees collected by it prior to the expiration of its substantive certification
period. Plans to spend development fees shall consist of the following
information:
§ 120-35.12. Violations and penalties.
A. A projection of revenues anticipated from imposing fees on
development, based on historic activity;
B. A description of the administrative mechanism that the Borough will
use to collect and distribute revenues;
C. A description of the anticipated use of all development fees;
D. A schedule for the creation or rehabilitation of housing units;
E. In the event the Borough envisions being responsible for public sector
or nonprofit construction of housing, a pro forma statement of the
anticipated costs and revenues associated with the development;
F. The manner through which the Borough will address any expected or
unexpected shortfall if the anticipated revenues from development fees
are not sufficient to implement the plan;
G. A description of the funds anticipated; and
H. A schedule for spending.
A. In the event that any of the conditions set forth in Subsection B of this
section occur, COAH shall be authorized, on behalf of the Borough, to
direct the manner in which all development fees collected pursuant to
§ 120-35.8 shall be expended. Should any such condition occur, such
revenues shall immediately become available for expenditure at the
direction of COAH upon the Borough Clerk's receipt of written
notification from COAH that such a condition has occurred.
B. Occurrence of the following may result in COAH taking an action
pursuant to Subsection A of this section:
(1) Failure to submit a spending plan pursuant to § 120-35.11 above
within the time limits imposed by COAH;
(2) Failure to meet deadlines for information required by COAH in its
review of the Borough's Housing Element and Fair Share Plan or its
spending plan;
(3) Failure to proceed through COAH's administrative process toward
substantive certification in a timely manner;

1:646
§ 120-35.13. Ongoing collection of development fees.
The ability for the Borough of Kenilworth to impose, collect and expend
development fees shall expire with the expiration of its substantive
certification unless the Borough has filed a revised and adopted Housing
Element and Fair Share Plan, has petitioned for substantive certification
for the succeeding round, and has received COAH's approval of a revised
development fee ordinance prior to the expiration. If the Borough of
Kenilworth fails to act before the expiration of its substantive certification,
the Borough may only resume the imposition and collection of development
fees by filing a revised and adopted Housing Element and Fair Share
Plan, petitioning for substantive certification for the succeeding round, and
after receiving COAH's approval of a revised development fee ordinance.
The Borough of Kenilworth shall not impose a development fee on a
development that receives preliminary or final approval after the expiration
of its substantive certification, nor shall the Borough of Kenilworth
retroactively impose a development fee on such a development. The
Borough of Kenilworth shall not expend development fees after the
expiration of its substantive certification.

determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner
thereof and the parties in interest an order:

structure by the owner within a reasonable time, which time shall
be set forth in the order or, at the option of the owner, to vacate or
have said building or structure vacated and closed within the time
set forth in that order; and

time as specified in said order of removal.

placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for human
habitation or occupancy or use; the use or occupation of this building is
prohibited and unlawful." [Amended at time of adoption of Code

thereof after advertisement for, and receipt of, bids therefor.

cause or arrange for the removal of the articles. The officer causing the
removal shall keep an accurate account of the cost thereof and shall
certify the cost and expense to the Mayor and Council, which shall
examine the certification. If the Mayor and Council shall find the same
correct, the cost shall be charged against the lands upon which the
articles are located and from which they were removed. A statement of
the cost shall forthwith be furnished by the Borough Clerk to the
Collector of Taxes, and the cost shall forthwith become a lien upon the
lands where the violation existed and shall be added to, become and
form part of the taxes next to be assessed and levied upon the lands, to
bear interest at the same rate as taxes, and the lien shall be collected
and enforced in the same manner as taxes, pursuant to the statutes

ARTICLE III
Sanitary Sewer Remediation
[Adopted 11-26-1997 by Ord. No. 97-22]
§ 158-25. Findings; purpose.
The governing body finds that by virtue of the age of the sanitary sewerage
infrastructure within the Borough there has been and continues to be a
problem with surface and subsurface water invading the system. This inflow
and infiltration water increases the average daily flow generated by the
Borough which, in many cases, causes the Borough to exceed its flow
rights resulting in sanctions imposed on the Borough by the Rahway Valley
Sewerage Authority. The purpose of this article is to establish a remediation
program to address the problem of inflow and infiltration in an attempt
to reduce the costs of sanitary sewage disposal to the residents of the
Borough.
§ 158-26. Inflow/Infiltration Remediation Program established;
improvement project schedule.
There is hereby established an Inflow/Infiltration Remediation Program in
the Borough of Kenilworth. The program shall be ongoing and continuous in
nature and shall be administered by the Borough Engineer. The governing
body, with the advice and assistance of the Borough Engineer, shall develop
a five-year capital improvement project schedule which shall identify and
prioritize those areas of the sanitary sewer system most urgently in need
of repair. On or before September of each year, the Borough Engineer shall
update the list with any new areas in need of repair.
§ 158-27. New construction fees; calculation; payment.
§ 158-28. Fees for existing facilities; calculation; payment.
A. Each property owner, agent or applicant seeking to obtain an
appropriate local endorsement or CP-1 approval from the Rahway
Valley Sewerage Authority (RVSA) for new construction of a
nonresidential facility shall, in addition to any fee payable to the RVSA,
be subject to payment of a remediation charge of $5 for each gallon of
flow per day anticipated to be generated by the proposed new
connection. The calculations of such flow shall be made by the Borough
Engineer using projected water usage and design flow estimates as
established, from time to time, by the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection (NJDEP).
B. Payment of the remediation fee as required by this section shall be
made at the time the fee for the local endorsement or CP-1 approval is
paid.
A. Each property owner, agent or applicant seeking to obtain a plumbing
permit to perform work on an existing facility which will have the net

§ 158-29. Escrow account.
The Borough Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized and directed to
establish an interest-bearing escrow account to be designated "Borough of
Kenilworth Inflow/Infiltration Remediation Account." All fees received by
the Borough pursuant to § 158-27 of this article shall be deposited in said
account and shall be dedicated to and, together with all accrued interest
earned thereon, be used solely and exclusively to perform corrective inflow/
infiltration work on the projects identified in § 158-26 of this article.
§ 158-30. Severability.
If any provision of this article shall be determined to be invalid by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect, impair
or invalidate the remainder but shall be confined in its operation to the
provisions directly involved.
effect of increasing the daily flow of such facility into the sanitary sewer
system shall pay a fee for such increase. The per gallon fee and method
of calculation shall be the same as that used in § 158-27 of this article.
B. The payment of the fee provided for in this section shall be in addition
to any other fees required to be paid for permits or other approvals, and
shall be collected prior to and as a condition of the issuance of a permit.

condition as it was prior to the excavation if the permittee fails to make
the necessary repairs or to complete the proper refilling of the opening
and the excavation work under the excavation permit.

which the Borough, the Borough Council or any Borough officer
may be liable by reason of any accident or injury to person or
property through the fault of the permittee, either in not properly

maintain any street where an excavation is made in a condition as
good as before said work shall have been done for a period of 12
months after said work shall have been done, usual wear and tear
excepted. Any settlement of the surface within said one-year period
shall be deemed conclusive evidence of defective backfilling by the
permittee.
B. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to require the permittee to
maintain any repairs to pavement made by the Borough if such repairs
should prove defective.
C. Recovery on such bond for any injury or accident shall not exhaust the
bond but it shall, in its entirety, cover any or all future accidents or
injuries during the excavation work for which it is given.
D. In the event of any suit or claim against the Borough by reason of the
negligence or default of the permittee, any final judgment against the
Borough requiring it to pay for such damage shall, upon the Borough
giving written notice to the permittee of such suit or claim, be
conclusive upon the permittee and his or her surety.
E. An annual bond may be given under this provision which shall remain in
force for one year, conditioned as above, in the amount specified above
and in other respects as specified above but applicable as to all
excavation work in streets by the principal in such bond during the term
of one year from said date.

$500. Such cash repair deposit may, by Council action, be returned with
interest to the utility after a twelve-month period wherein the Borough
has made no charges or written demands against the deposit.

any action, which may result from the issuance of any permit and the work
in connection therewith.
§ 170-22.1. General standards.

regard to the opening, backfilling and resurfacing of any public street or
public place:
A. The permittee shall keep each opening properly guarded and, at night,
have lights placed thereat and, in doing the work, interfere as little as
possible with the travel along the road and open no greater part of the
road at any time than shall be allowed by the Borough. If the excavation
is to extend the full width of the road, no more than 1/2 of the road shall
be opened at one time, and such 1/2 shall be backfilled before the other
1/2 is opened, so as to permit the free flow of traffic.
B. The opening shall be backfilled immediately, and the pavement shall be
restored with at least a temporary pavement or bituminous concrete
base material unless otherwise directed by the Borough Engineer.
C. Restoration of the opening shall be the responsibility of the permittee,
and any deposit posted with the Borough as hereinbefore provided shall
be returned only after compliance with § 170-20 of this article.
D. The applicant shall give a twenty-four-hour notice to the Borough
Engineer prior to making an opening and prior to beginning surface
restoration.
E. No opening shall be commenced on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday,
except in a case of emergency.
F. On a bituminous-surface-treated road, the edges of the opening shall be
cut straight through the bituminous surface before the trench is
excavated.
G. The work shall be so conducted as not to interfere with the water mains,
gas lines, sewer lines or their connections with houses unless the
permission of the proper authorities shall have been obtained. All rock
within five feet of a water main or other pipe, which might be damaged
thereby, shall be removed without blasting. No excavation which will
damage trees shall be made.
H. After the underground installation has been completed, the permittee
shall promptly backfill the excavation. The backfill may consist of the
excavated materials but shall be free of all organic material, debris and
clay. It shall be placed in lifts of no more than 12 inches, each lift to be
thoroughly compacted to a grade of 24 inches below subgrade, the

an excavation in or tear up the surface of any road without first having
remainder to be backfilled with bank-run gravel. Should the excavated
material be unsuitable for backfill, in the opinion of the Borough
Engineer, then the entire trench shall be backfilled with bank-run
gravel and compacted as described above. Bank-run gravel shall
conform to New Jersey State Department of Transportation soil
aggregate dry Type 1A.
I. After the backfill has been placed, the permittee shall install a
temporary pavement of bituminous material over the opening and shall
keep such temporary pavement to grade until it has been replaced by a
permanent pavement.
J. When final settlement has taken place, the permittee shall replace the
temporary pavement with a permanent pavement, which shall not be
less than 12 inches larger than the length and width of the opening. The
permanent pavement shall be of the same type as the original
pavement, unless authorized by the Borough Engineer. The Borough
Engineer shall be given one day's written notice previous to the time
when the permanent pavement is to be installed in order to permit an
inspection thereof.
K. The permittee shall utilize advanced reconstruction technology (e.g.,
infrared) to restore the pavement surface to the satisfaction of the
Borough Engineer. [Added 10-22-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-18]
L. If work so permitted is to be performed on a street or roadway in the
Borough within five years after the street or roadway has been
resurfaced and/or reconstructed, the permittee shall be required to:
[Added 10-22-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-18]
(1) Provide a written explanation as to the necessity of the work to the
Borough Engineer.
(2) Utilize advanced technologies subject to the approval of the
Borough Engineer (e.g., infrared) to restore the work area.

Such guarantees may be posted as cash, irrevocable letter of credit
or bond in a form approved by the Borough Attorney (minimum
guarantee shall be $1,000).
(4) Post escrow funds of $750 to allow the Borough Engineer to make
inspections as necessary to assure compliance with the

Department a statement concerning the emergency in question. If the
emergency occurs on a weekend, the FAX notice required by this section
shall be made to the Police Department.
§ 170-22.3. Indemnification of Borough.
In accepting a permit, the permittee shall be deemed to have agreed to
indemnify and save harmless the Borough from and against any and all
loss, costs or damages incurred by reason of any damage to any property,

permittee, its agents or servants in performing the work covered by the

§ 170-40. Purpose. [Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch.
1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
The purpose of this article is to supplement Chapter 170 as provided by
state law so as to permit persons with a disability to safely and efficiently
access their home and/or business from municipal streets.
§ 170-41. Handicapped parking zones. [Amended at time of
adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
A. In accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.46 and 39:4-197.6, handicapped
parking zones are hereby established within the Borough of Kenilworth.
A "handicapped parking zone" means an area of a public roadway
designated for use by a particular person with a disability as provided
for therein and which is so marked by proper signage and roadway
markings. The term "person with a disability" is defined as set forth in
N.J.S.A. 39:4-204.

locations which have been established as restricted parking zones as
referred to in the schedule maintained in the office of the Borough
Clerk and in the schedule of handicapped spaces within the general
ordinances of the Borough,136 unless such person is a person with a
disability who has applied for the establishment of the handicapped
parking zone in accordance with N.J.S.A. 39:4-197.6 and pursuant to
this section. Any vehicle parked in a parking zone which does not
display the permit for the use of that particular handicapped parking
zone pursuant to N.J.S.A. 39:4-197.7 is presumed to have been parked
in such a stall unlawfully and subject to the fines and penalties set forth
in Title 39 of the New Jersey Statutes.

will be established for persons who do not possess a valid "person with
a disability" identification card and placard or handicapped plates, and/
or a valid vehicle registration with the vehicle registered in their name
or that of a spouse who resides at the same location. However, those
persons who are parents or legal guardians of developmentally disabled
children residing on a full-time basis within the same household and
conforming to Subsection A herein may be eligible. No restricted
parking zone will be established for applicants who have a driveway,

residence which is available for their use.
A. In accordance with N.J.S.A. 39:4-197.5 and 39:4-205, parking spaces for
persons with a disability are established. A "handicapped parking
space" means an area of a public roadway or public parking lot
designated for use by any person with a disability as provided for and
which is so marked by proper signage and roadway markings. The term
"person with a disability" is defined as set forth in N.J.S.A. 39:4-204.

Provisions, Art. II)]

a disability. Any vehicle parked in a parking stall reserved for disabled
drivers pursuant to this article which does not display the official state

Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, is presumed to have parked in such a
stall unlawfully and subject to the fines and penalties set forth in Title
39 of the New Jersey Statutes. [Amended at time of adoption of
Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]
C. Applications for the establishment of handicapped parking zones and
handicapped parking spaces may be obtained from the Borough Clerk's
office and shall be filed, along with the appropriate documentation, with
the Borough's Police Department, with a copy provided to the Municipal
Clerk. The applicant shall submit an initial processing fee of $175 for a
handicapped parking space to the Borough Clerk, made payable to the
Borough, at the time the application is filed. An annual renewal fee
thereafter of $100 shall be paid with the submission of each annual
renewal application. The Traffic Officer shall, within 10 business days
after receipt of an application, review it and shall investigate each
application for compliance with this article. After the Traffic Officer has
determined compliance and the validity of the need, the application is
to be submitted so that an amendment to the Municipal Code for the
reserved parking space may be drafted. The Traffic Officer may, at his
or her discretion, require a personal interview with the applicant at his
or her residence. The applicant shall present at the interview any and
all documentation which he or she believes relevant to the applicant's
request. If the applicant does not possess adequate documentation to
verify his or her eligibility under this article, the application may be
denied.
D. Any individual that may be designated as indigent by the Borough's
Welfare Director or with liquid assets of less than $3,000 and the prior
calendar year's gross income equal to or less than $12,000 shall be

The waiver of the fees shall remain in effect for two calendar years from

authority of the Borough Council acting through ordinance after a
recommendation from the Traffic Officer. If the Borough Council so
approves, the Police Department shall establish a restricted parking
space in front of or near the residence of the applicant and shall issue a
permit in compliance with N.J.S.A. 39:4-197.7. In the case of an
application for a handicapped parking space, the Borough Council shall
establish a handicapped parking space pursuant to N.J.S.A. 39:4-197.5.
Only the motor vehicle for which a valid permit has been issued shall be
parked in such zone, and only when the permit is properly displayed.
Only one permit is issued to the applicant per household.
F. Applicants who do not meet all of the requirements of the above are to
be notified of the denial of their application by mail. The application fee
will not be refunded until 10 days after final determination of all
appeals, should such appeal be taken as set forth in Subsection H
below.
G. All handicapped parking spaces are valid for the same period that the
handicapped placard is valid.
H. Any party denied a handicapped parking space has the opportunity to
request reconsideration of such decision. A letter requesting
reconsideration must be received by the Traffic Officer and the Borough
Clerk within 20 days of the date that notice of denial is received. The
applicant will then be instructed as to when the Borough Council will
hold a hearing at a regularly scheduled work session to consider any
relevant evidence pertaining to the applicant's eligibility. It is the
applicant's responsibility to set forth any and all reasons and
documentation in support of his or her application. The applicant will be
notified by mail of the decision on reconsideration. No more than one
application for reconsideration to the Public Safety Committee will be
given to each applicant in any calendar-year period. Thereafter, the
applicant may reapply in accordance with this subsection after six
months have elapsed from the date of the notice of denial. A twenty-day
grace period will be afforded each applicant after the date of lapse.
[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. II)]
I. There will be a fine of $700 penalty per application for any fraudulent
application that is submitted. In the case where a permit is granted
under a fraudulent application, an additional fine of $50 per day will be
imposed on the holder of the fraudulently procured or renewed permit,
with a maximum penalty of $2,000. The penalties within this subsection
may be waived if the Borough elects to prosecute the applicant for a
violation under the applicable portions of Title 2C of the New Jersey

J. In the event that the applicant states that due to financial hardship he
or she is unable to submit the required application fees under this
section, then in that event the applicant for the handicapped parking
may briefly explain the circumstances of the applicant's financial
hardship and request to the Council that the application fee or renewal
fee be waived. Any applicant receiving Medicaid or participating in the
State of New Jersey Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and
Disabled (PAAD) program shall have his or her fee waived without
further explanation.

room, containing one or more ultraviolet lamps, intended for irradiation of
any part of the human body that induces skin tanning.
TANNING FACILITY  Any commercial enterprise or establishment
containing one or more pieces of tanning equipment made available to the

§ 213-3. License required; application; liability insurance.

findings:
(1) There has been rapid growth in popularity of facilities offing

light emitted by tanning booth lamps will cause skin burns and eye
damage; and
(4) It has been established that chronic exposure to ultraviolet light
can result in increased incidences of skin cancer.
D. To protect the health, welfare and safety of its citizens from the
potential hazards associated with the operation of tanning equipment at
tanning facilities and gyms, the governing body of the Borough of
Kenilworth hereby adopts licensing procedures and standards to

New Jersey, Inc., (the "company"), its successors and assigns, to install,
operate, inspect, maintain, repair, replace and remove its communications

company by the present ordinance.
§ A218-2. Location of poles and posts.
All poles, posts, pedestals, cabinets or other facilities shall be located and
placed back of the curblines where shown on the Official Map(s) of the

of the face of such curbline or as may otherwise be mutually agreed by
both parties, or at the points or places now occupied by the poles, posts,

agree to another location. Manholes shall be located at such points along
the line of underground conduits as may be necessary or convenient for
placing, maintaining and operating the facilities, as aforementioned, which
the company may from time to time use in connection with its underground
conduit system, and shall be so constructed as to conform to the crosssectional
and longitudinal grade of the surface so as not to interfere with
the safety or convenience of persons or vehicles.
§ A218-4. Notice and permits required; restoration.

opening or excavation permits as may be lawfully required by any
applicable ordinances regulating such openings or excavations. Any such
area affected by the company in constructing its facilities shall be restored

installation or maintenance connected with the work or equipment of said
company and not attributable to the fault or negligence of the Borough,

concurring negligence or fault of the company and the Borough, the same
shall be borne by them to the extent of their respective fault or negligence.
§ A218-6. Relocation of curblines and facilities.

conductors, cable or the equivalent which provide a means of transmitting
any signal to a private, commercial or residential location, and which is
normally provided by a nongovernmental supplier; provided, further, that
no such use or attachment by the Borough shall interfere with the plant
or facilities of or the use thereof by the company. All costs or expenses
incurred by the company in connection therewith shall be paid by the
Borough. It shall be the obligation of the Borough to attach its wires to
the poles or place its electric conductors in the conduits or manholes of
the company, provided that before proceeding with said work either by
itself or by a person, firm or corporation engaged to perform such work,
the Borough shall give the company 30 days' prior notice in writing. All
such work shall be performed under the supervision of said company. The
Borough will indemnify and save harmless the company from and against all
claims, liabilities or demands arising in any manner in connection with the
Borough's wires or facilities or their installation, maintenance, operation
or removal or the Borough's use or enjoyment of the company's plant or
facilities provided under this section.
§ A218-9. Control of streets by county, state.
If any or all of the said streets or ways are later taken over by the County of

of use as apply herein to the Borough, provided, however, that satisfactory
prior arrangements as may be necessary are made with the Borough and
the company for the full protection of the respective interest of each.

In the event that any provision herein shall for any reason be illegal or
unenforceable under applicable law, such illegality or unenforceability shall
not affect any other provisions of this ordinance, and this ordinance shall
be construed as if such illegal or unenforceable provision(s) had never been
contained herein.
