PREFACE 
This Republication constitutes a complete republication of the ordinances of the City of Reno of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Code as supplemented through January 2006 and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1966 Code, 1981 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, section 18.12.050 is Section .050, located in Chapter 12 of Title 18. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Acknowledgments 
The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of John Dombroski, Vice-President for Production and Anne Wilson and Janet Cramer, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other member's of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
Sec. 1.05.005. - Declaration of purpose. 
The council finds that the enforcement of the Reno Municipal Code ("Code") throughout the city is an important public service, and enforcement of the Code is vital to protection of the public's health, safety and quality of life. The council recognizes that enforcement starts with the implementation of regulations that can be applied in administrative enforcement hearings and appropriate appeals. The council further finds that a comprehensive Code Enforcement system requires a variety of administrative remedies for the effective enforcement of violations of the Code. The procedures established in this chapter shall be in addition to any civil or any other legal remedy established by law which may be pursued to address violations of the Code. The use of procedures established in this chapter, except as specifically provided otherwise, shall be in lieu of criminal sanctions. 
The council also finds that there is a need to establish uniform procedures for administrative enforcement hearings conducted pursuant to the Code.

Bryan v. City of Sparks, 36 Nev. 573, Pac. 522 (1913). 
(6) "The reasons given for sustaining the requirement of a bond are manifest and convincing as set forth in Ex Parte Cardinal (Calif.) 150 Pac. 348: `We see no reason to doubt the power of the state, or any county or municipality, in the exercise of its police power of regulation, to require security in the shape of a bond or insurance policy from its licensees in all cases where the giving of such security may fairly be held to a reasonable requirement for the protection of the public'." Ex parte Counts, 39 Nev. 61, 153 Pac. 93 (1915). 
(7) An admission to the bar of a state is a vested and valuable right, but subject to taxation, including a city occupation tax. The imposition of a license tax upon an occupation is not illegal, because not expressly authorized by the state constitution, but is permissible, unless prohibited thereby. There is no inherent vice in the taxation of vocations. On the contrary, business is as legitimate an object of the taxing power as property. Ex parte Dixon, 43 Nev. 196, 183 Pac. 642 (1919). 
(8) Charter of Carson City which after enumerating many kinds of business upon which the city is authorized to impose a license tax, authorizes it to fix and have collected a license tax on all trades, professions, and classes of business not thereinbefore specified. "To the layman this provision would be clear and unequivocal, needing no interpretation, elucidation, amplification, or consideration. Why not so in the realm of jurisprudence? To the layman it no doubt appears at a glance that this general provision could have but one meaning, purpose, or object, for the discovery of which no prolonged or profound search should be necessary, namely, to make subject to a tax levy any business, trade or profession which through oversight had been omitted from the list of businesses enumerated … The sole purpose of the legislation was to enable the city to bring all kinds of business within its taxing power." Carson City v. Red Arrow Garage Auto Co., 47 Nev. 473, 225 Pac. 487 (1924). 
(9) Power of the legislature under constitution to tax a business is … settled, and the authority to delegate it to municipal corporations cannot be questioned. Ex parte Nyod, 48 Nev. 120, 227 Pac. 1020 (1924).

CHAPTER 4.06. - MOTEL INSPECTION PROGRAM  
ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
Sec. 4.06.005. - Title. 
This chapter shall be known as the "Motel Inspection Program of the City of Reno", may be cited as such, and will be referred to hereafter as "MIP Chapter". 
(Ord. No. 6482, § 1, 8-22-18)  
Sec. 4.06.010. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  Unsafe housing is a community blight often associated with unlawful activity. While the cost of enforcement is significant, the result of failing to abate substandard housing has more adverse and far-reaching consequences, such as the loss of housing and displacement of individuals. 
(b)  The purpose of this chapter is to address the shortage of safe, sanitary and affordable rental housing options for residents in the city. Non-transient lodging rental properties that were formerly built as motels have historically provided affordable rental options of last resort for low-income persons. This chapter proactively identifies blighted and deteriorated non-transient lodging rental properties and enables them to rehabilitate units that do not meet minimum building, housing and property maintenance code standards so as to provide safe, habitable rental units for low-income persons to occupy, and further, to preserve and enhance the quality of life for residents of the city. 
(c)  It is important that the city not only enforce on a complaint-initiated basis, but also conduct routine annual inspections in order to better address and reduce substandard housing within structures that were formerly built as transient motels in the city. It is important to conduct routine inspections on non-transient lodging rental properties due to the inherent problems associated with properties that are essentially converted from transient to non-transient lodging. 
(d)  In the City of Reno it is imperative to establish enforceable minimum standards for non-transient lodging rental properties which typically consist of older motels converted from transient type occupancy to long term occupancy without the benefits of code compliant permits and process. Long term occupancy rentals are typically addressed similar to apartments or homes which have specific zoning, building and fire code requirements that are enforced upon development. These requirements typically do not apply to transient lodging rental properties. The purpose of this chapter is to establish standards for maintaining all converted non-transient lodging rental properties in the city and thereby safeguard life, limb, health, property, safety, and welfare of the public. 
(e)  The City of Reno finds as follows: 
(1)  There exists within the City of Reno, properties that were issued a certificate of occupancy and were approved to operate as transient lodging rental properties, which have been organically converted into non-transient lodging rental properties without review of compliance with all property related codes adopted by the City of Reno. 
(2)  These properties have served as affordable housing for many residents within the city, and although the properties have not received the appropriate inspections and approvals, the housing is necessary for many residents within the City of Reno. 
(3)  It is imperative to establish enforceable minimum standards for converted non-transient lodging rental properties and to provide a program for enforcing these standards. 
(4)  Residents of converted non-transient lodging rental property benefit from a property maintenance code enforcement program. 
(5)  It is recognized that these non-transient rental properties are necessary and serve as affordable housing and this chapter shall apply to all converted non-transient lodging rental properties, buildings, units, and premises within the city without regard to the date of construction or alteration. 
(6)  The implementation of an annual inspection program will ensure compliance with all laws, rules and ordinances established within the RMC to include the property maintenance, residential, building, and fire codes. This will also include any health or public safety related adopted city or county ordinances.

(1)  If the work card is revoked, the work card holder may appeal and request review of the revocation by the police chief or designee and shall request such review within ten business days of the date of revocation. The failure to commence such a timely appeal shall be deemed a waiver of any and all objections to the revocation or suspension. The police chief or designee shall issue a review decision in writing within five business days of the request for review. 
a.  Notification of the review decision shall be provided either personally or by certified mail, mailed to the work card holder's address on file with the work applicant unit. Each work card holder has the burden to furnish any change of address to the work applicant unit. Notice of the review decision shall officially commence on the day the decision is personally given or the day the decision is deposited into the mail under certification. 
b.  An applicant who seeks to engage in First Amendment expressive conduct and whose revocation of a work card has been upheld on review may file or cause to be filed in the district court a petition labeled as a "First Amendment Petition" for judicial review challenging the validity of the revocation of the work card as provided by NRS Chapter 34. 
c.  An applicant who does not seek to engage in First Amendment expressive conduct and whose denial of a work card has been upheld on review may appeal the decision of the chief of police or designee in accordance with the procedure set forth under RMC section 4.04.160. 
(2)  An applicant who seeks to engage in First Amendment expressive conduct, upon request for review of the revocation, the work card holder shall be issued a temporary work card. The temporary work card will carry an expiration date of thirty days from the date of the request for review. 
(3)  If a work card is revoked, and after appeal has been pursued through final decision or the time for appeal has expired without pursuit of appeal, the city may notify, as applicable to the individual, adult interactive cabaret(s) within the City of Reno that the work card has been revoked. 
(h)  Pending charges. While criminal charges enumerated in subsection (d) are pending, a person who applies for a work card, reports a name change, change of contact information, or reports a lost or stolen work card, will be issued a temporary work card. The temporary work card will carry, as an expiration date, the date the criminal charges are scheduled to be heard in a court of law. The expiration date will be extended, as necessary, until the criminal charges have been adjudicated. If disposition of the criminal matter results in work card denial, the applicant may pursue review and appeal pursuant to subsection (f)(1). It is the applicant's responsibility to obtain a temporary work card with a new expiration date. 
(i)  Validity. A permanent work card will be valid for five years from the date of initial application and will expire thereafter. Appeals of adverse decisions or issuance of temporary work cards shall not serve to extend the expiration date. A permanent work card issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance will retain the expiration date in effect when the permanent work card was issued. A work card issued under this section does not satisfy work card requirements for persons otherwise employed by or acting as an independent contractor for the businesses identified under RMC section 5.05.011.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 6513, § 1, adopted May 8, 2019, amended ch. 5.06 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former ch. 5.06, §§ 5.06.011—5.06.050, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 4765, § 1, adopted July 8, 1997; Ord. No. 5052, § 1, adopted Sept. 28, 1999; Ord. No. 5903, § 1, adopted Feb. 28, 2007; Ord. No. 5998, § 1, adopted Jan. 16, 2008. 
 
Sec. 5.06.005. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  The purpose of these adult business regulations is to prevent crime, protect the city tourist and retail trade, maintain property values, and preserve the quality of the city's neighborhoods, commercial districts and urban life, and permit reasonable alternative avenues of communication to prevent the proliferation of illegal sex-related businesses. It is not the intent nor effect of this code to restrict or deny access by adults to adult businesses protected by the First Amendment; nor is it to suppress any speech activities protected by the First Amendment. Instead, the intent is to enact a content-neutral ordinance which addresses the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses. 
The predominant concern of these regulations is the limitation and prevention of the adverse secondary effects of the operation of adult businesses which manifest through exposure of minors to adult business activities and materials (including in the form of exterior signage), distraction to motorists, harm to neighboring properties, businesses and tourism, spread of disease, commission of crime and exacerbation of these effects by the clustering of adult businesses and allowance and use of alcohol on the premises of adult businesses. 
The provisions of these regulations have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing any limitation or restriction on the content of any communication, including adult business-related materials or performances. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of these regulations to restrict or deny access by adults to adult business-related communication protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors, exhibitors, and performers of adult business-related communication to their intended market. Likewise, the city seeks to assure adequate locations within the City of Reno for the conduct of adult businesses, and that regulations governing adult businesses are content neutral reasonable time, place and manner regulations furthering the purpose of these regulations. 
(b)  Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of the operation of adult businesses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council, including findings and interpretations incorporated in multiple court cases, and including multiple studies and reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around adult businesses, the city council finds: 
(1)  Adult businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, exposure of minors to adult business activities and materials (including in the form of exterior signage), exposure of minors to alcohol and adverse secondary effects associated with adult businesses, decrease in nearby property value in both commercial and residential areas, impairment to the economic vitality of nearby businesses, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of and exacerbating adverse secondary effects. 
(2)  Adult businesses should be separated by suitable zoning location and reasonably spaced from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses. 
(3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this section of code, exists independent of any comparative analysis between adult businesses and non-adult businesses. In addition, the city's interest in regulating adult businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future adult businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this section of code are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. 
The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses, including the judicial opinions, expert testimony, scholarly literature, and reports related to such secondary effects. 
(Ord. No. 6513, § 1, 5-8-19)

The 30-day suspension may be imposed by the business license division by mailing a notice of the suspension to the licensee's address on file with the business license division, along with copies of the three convictions. The 30-day suspension shall begin ten business days following the mailing of the notice of suspension, unless the licensee files an appeal to the administrative hearing officer in accordance with RMC 4.04.160 under the heading entitled fee dispute or other grievance. An appeal shall stay imposition of the suspension.

Sec. 5.08.120. - Number of pawnbroker's licenses permitted. 
Purpose. The city council finds that a mix of commercial uses attractive to tourists and residents is a necessary ingredient to a vital downtown. The city has expended large sums of money to make downtown viable through the redevelopment agency. The city council wants to provide the opportunity for the efforts of the redevelopment agency to come to fruition prior to its expiration in 2017. The city finds that the present ratio of pawn shops to population is too high and should not be increased in the future. The city hereby establishes the preferred ratio of pawn shops to population as the number licensed and in operation downtown in 1991, less one, divided by population, or one pawnshop per 15,500 residents. 
(a)  Licenses may be approved at a rate of one for every 15,500 residents. The basis for determining population increase shall be the City of Reno Community Development Department monthly population projection. 
(b)  The city recognizes all pawnbrokers with approved business licenses or special use permits who received these permits prior to April 30, 1992 and maintain them in good standing. 
(c)  The city council shall establish a procedure for selecting licensees when more licenses can be approved.

(6)  If a licensee continues to operate over seven slot machines after filing a report disclosing a failure to comply with the requirements of subsection (a) above, or after a finding by the city manager or designee of a failure to meet the requirements of subsection (a) above, the city manager or designee may immediately cause a complaint and citation to be issued pursuant to chapters 1.05 and 4.04 of this Code, and set a hearing to revoke the license or take other disciplinary action.

Sec. 5.13.020. - Purpose. 
It is the purpose of the city council to establish a consistent process for permitting special events conducted by the public or private sector to use city streets, facilities or services and for permitting special activities on private property. It is recognized that these special events and special activities enhance the lifestyle of northern Nevada residents and visitors and provide benefits to the citizens through the creation of unique venues for expression and entertainment that are not normally provided as a part of governmental services. By recognizing special event and special activity venues, this chapter is intended to supplement land use regulations, to provide a coordinated process for the regulation of certain activities to be conducted in conjunction with special events and special activities, to ensure the health and safety of patrons of special events and special activities, to prohibit illegal activity from occurring within special event and special activity venues, and to protect the rights and interests granted to a special event or special activity permit holder. It is also the intent and direction of the city council that this chapter be administered consistent with the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and/or Article I, Sections 9 and 10 of the Nevada Constitution and applicable case law so as to protect the rights of citizens to engage in expressive activities and yet allow for the least restrictive and reasonable, time, place and manner regulation necessary to serve substantial governmental interests affected by those expressive activities. 
(Ord. No. 5695, § 2, 4-27-05; Ord. No. 6030, § 1, 6-11-08; Ord. No. 6231, § 1, 5-23-12)  
Sec. 5.13.030. - Permit requirements and enforcement.

(2)  It shall be unlawful for any person to undertake, conduct, operate, maintain or manage a special event without first having obtained a special event permit from the city in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, unless exempt from the permit requirement. 
(3)  It shall be unlawful for any person to register participants, sell or give away tickets to a special activity without first having submitted a completed special activity permit application to the city in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(4)  It shall be unlawful for any person to undertake, conduct, operate, maintain or manage a special activity without first having obtained a special activity permit from the city in accordance with the provisions of this chapter unless exempt from the permit requirement. 
(5)  Attention is called to the fact that other laws may be applicable and other licenses and permits may be required. For example, a special event occurring in a park will also require a park permit pursuant to Reno Municipal Code Chapter 8.23 to ensure that there are no conflicting events and staff are aware of the event and all events will be subject to criminal laws and park regulations in chapter 8.23. 
(Ord. No. 5695, § 2, 4-27-05; Ord. No. 6030, § 1, 6-11-08; Ord. No. 6231, § 1, 5-23-12)  
Sec. 5.13.035. - Closed convention limited exemption. 
(a)  The event organizer of a closed convention is not required to obtain a business license for operation as a closed convention, and may operate only by virtue of the operation being a properly conducted closed convention. 
(b)  Vendors operating wholly within a closed convention are not required to obtain individual business licenses for operation within a closed convention, and may operate only by virtue of the operation being a part of a properly conducted closed convention. 
(c)  Operation of a closed convention or operation by vendors within a closed convention shall not constitute an exemption from the requirements otherwise prescribed by this Code including, but not limited to, regulation by Title 5, or other local, state or federal law or regulation or administrative policy pertaining to such activities. Inclusion in this section shall constitute only an exemption from the fee and informational requirements for the business licensing of any vendor at a closed convention which may otherwise defined as a "business" or "doing business" pursuant to section 4.04.007. 
(Ord. No. 6081, § 2, 1-14-09)  
Sec. 5.13.040. - Exceptions to permit requirement.

a.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any gathering or march organized as an expressive activity related to events occasioned by news or affairs coming into public knowledge within five days of such gathering or march may file the notification no later than two business days before the gathering or march. For news or affairs coming into public knowledge within 72 hours of the expressive event, the two business day requirement shall be shortened to one business day. If the notification cannot be timely submitted, the event organizer may conduct a gathering on the grounds of the city plaza, if not otherwise being used by or with the permission of the city for another event. If the notification cannot be timely submitted and the city plaza is not available, the expressive gathering may take place in a city park which is not being used for an organized recreational purpose or pursuant to a permit for another event.

Sec. 5.13.045. - Free speech areas, display stands and sales of First Amendment protected expressive merchandise. 
(a)  Findings and purpose:  The city finds that special events are often crowded to the extent that there is a substantial need to create reasonable time, place and manner regulations governing the placement of display stands and expressive merchandise by those exercising their First Amendment rights in or adjacent to congested special events to ensure safety, facilitate crowd movement and ensure access for emergency personnel and equipment. The city further finds that special events contribute substantially to the city's economic welfare and that event organizers, and therefore the city, have a substantial interest in protecting the event organizer's theme and the interests of the event organizer's sub-licensed commercial vendors justifying reasonable time, place and manner regulations governing the placement of expressive merchandise and display stands during special events. Free speech areas shall be located inside or immediately adjacent to special event venues where they will not unreasonably isolate speakers from the attending public or unreasonably interfere with permitted activities, crowd flow, or normal or emergency city functions. 
(b)  Definitions:   
(1)  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, the words and terms defined in RMC 5.14.010, including but not limited to display stand and expressive merchandise, have the meanings ascribed to them in that section. 
(2)  Free speech area shall mean an area in or adjacent to a special event venue which shall be designated as a special area on special event venue maps available to the public from the city clerk, or which shall be designated by signage and physical means or markings at the special event area, wherein persons may exercise their First Amendment rights during a special event, including but not limited to using display stands and selling expressive merchandise. 
(3)  Speaker shall mean a person or persons exercising their First Amendment rights in a public forum. 
(c)  Special event boundaries:  As part of the application process, an event organizer applicant shall propose, and city staff shall determine, specific boundaries and entrance-exit points for the special event venue. The boundaries of the free speech area(s) shall also be determined if the city manager determines during the special event permitting process that one or more free speech areas is necessary or desirable. The public shall be provided notice of the boundaries by the time the special event is open to the public through any reasonable means, including but not limited to special event venue maps made available through the city clerk or by mechanical means at the special event venue, including but not limited to combinations such as: physical barriers, streets, signage, paint, chalk marks and geographic features such as rivers. 
(d)  Expressive speech and conduct:  During special events, except as set forth hereafter in this section, expressive speech and conduct protected by the First Amendment shall be allowed in the free speech area(s) to the extent a speaker's conduct does not unreasonably interfere with the permitted activities of the special event or normal or emergency city functions. 
(e)  Free speech areas:   
(1)  The city manager shall designate and modify, as reasonably necessary, the location and size of one or more free speech areas sufficient to reasonably accommodate speakers and/or event organizers desiring a free speech area(s) at a special event. To the extent reasonably feasible, the minimum number, size and locations of the free speech area(s) shall be determined in advance of the special event. 
(2)  Any speaker who desires space for display stands, expressive merchandise or other expressive activity within a special event free speech area may advise the city clerk of their name, contact information and plans and the city clerk shall promptly notify the city manager's designee, who shall take the request into consideration when determining the need for special event free speech areas pursuant to the previous subsection.

The estimated fee shall not include business license fees; fees for special permits or inspections such as building permits or fire permits; late fees; or fees levied by the Washoe County Health Department. The city manager shall send the event organizer an invoice for the estimated city services fee. The event organizer shall make full payment of the estimated city services fee along with any applicable late fee required pursuant to section 5.13.090 upon receipt, or 15 days prior to the date set for commencement of setup for the event, whichever is later.

City council or council means the present governing body of the city or any future council constituting the legislative body of the city. 
Commercial means activity or speech, including but not limited to the advertising or selling of merchandise, conducted for the primary purpose of proposing or completing a transaction for generation of profit and which is thereby subject to a lower standard of protection under the First Amendment than pure speech or expression. 
Creative unit means two or more persons jointly engaged in the creation or production of items of artistic sell expression, no one of whom stands in an employer-employee relationship to any of the other members thereof. At least one member of the creative unit must be present to be protected by the First Amendment when creating, displaying, offering or selling items of artistic self expression on sidewalks, parks or other public forums. 
Expressive merchandise means: (i) items of artistic self expression; (ii) items inextricably intertwined with a particularized message; and, (iii) any other items which have been held by the courts to be expressive and protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. 
Items inextricably intertwined with a particularized message means an item which is offered, displayed or sold that is inseparable from and intrinsically intertwined with the overall expression of a political, religious, philosophical or ideological message, doctrine, concept, belief or idea. Examples include but are not limited to: bumper stickers; hats or buttons with messages such as "Earth Now", "Peace Not War" or "Support Unions"; bibles; religious brochures; election pamphlets; a toy stuffed whale with a "Greenpeace" logo or tag affixed so that it is intended to convey a philosophical message of "Save the Whales"; and an unlabeled toy doll of an emaciated child, with no apparent connection to any organization, distributed to donors by "Save the Children" at a booth with their name and educational handouts. 
Items of artistic self expression means the creation, display, offer or sale by the item's creator or creative unit of one or more items which are inherently expressive of its creator's perspective and therefore fully protected by the First Amendment. These items include but are not necessarily limited to: paintings, drawings, sculpture, tattooing, photography, prints of self expression, engravings, stained glass as non-functional "art for art's sake", recordings of the artist's composition or performance of performing arts including music, dance, theater, and films. 
Artistic self expression does not include items which are intended to serve any functional or utilitarian use or purpose, even if the item is decorative. Examples of such items include handcrafts, jewelry, tools, clothing, food, pottery, silver work, metal work, woodwork, leather goods, house wares, appliances, clothing, sunglasses, auto parts, oils, incense, perfume, lotions, candles, toys, stuffed animals and trinkets. 
Artistic self expression may include items that appear on first impression to be functional or utilitarian, but have been modified to demonstrate the expressive "art for art's sake" intent of its creator, and are not intended to serve any utilitarian, functional or commercial uses or purposes. Examples include but are not limited to: 
(1)  A stained glass window presented as art for art's sake, and not intended or understood to be used as a functional window. 
(2)  Pottery as tableware is utilitarian even if it is decorative. However, pottery may become expressive where it has been modified and presented as art for art's sake, i.e., modified and presented to be expressive of its creator's perspective and intended for display rather than for use as tableware. 
(3)  While a macramé pot hanger has a functional purpose and would not be protected artistic self expression, a macramé soft sculpture with no other purpose than to hang on the wall as "art for art's sake" would be protected. 
Merchandise means personal property, commodities or goods. 
Sidewalk means areas lawfully open to public use or passage including walkways, paths, sidewalks and other public ways set apart by curbs, barriers, markings or other delineation for pedestrian travel, excluding streets and other public ways improved, used or designed for use by vehicular traffic.

CHAPTER 5.19. - TOBACCO PARAPHERNALIA 
 
Sec. 5.19.010. - Findings. 
The Reno City Council finds and declares as follows: 
(1)  Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of premature death in the United States, causing over 400,000 deaths in the United States each year; 
(2)  Each day, nearly 4,000 children under 18 years of age smoke their first cigarette, and almost 1,500 children under 18 years of age begin smoking daily; more than 75 percent of all current smokers in 2001 began smoking before the age of 18; 
(3)  Tobacco companies sell products that are addictive and inherently dangerous, causing cancer, heart disease, and other serious illnesses; 
(4)  The City of Reno has a substantial interest in reducing the number of individuals of all ages who use cigarettes and other tobacco products, and a particular interest in protecting adolescents from tobacco dependence and the illnesses and premature death associated with tobacco use; 
(5)  An overwhelming majority of Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products while they are adolescents and become addicted to those products before reaching the age of 18; 
(6)  Tobacco paraphernalia displays lead juveniles to develop favorable beliefs about tobacco use, overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and engage in illegal purchases of tobacco products or paraphernalia; 
(7)  The display of tobacco paraphernalia plays a crucial role in the decision of individuals, and adolescents in particular, to begin using tobacco products; 
(8)  The World Health Organization has endorsed a ban on retail tobacco product displays as an effective method of reducing tobacco use; 
(9)  Research suggests that preventing the display of tobacco products will lead to a significant decrease in the number of adolescents becoming addicted to those tobacco products and will assist individuals in their efforts to quit smoking; 
(10)  The Center for Disease Control recognizes that a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach is necessary to adequately address the issue of youth tobacco use; 
(11)  Due to federal preemption, the City of Reno lacked the legal authority to limit the display of tobacco products prior to the enactment of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009; 
(12)  3,430 deaths in Nevada were attributable to smoking-related diseases;

(16)  In 2010, there were 433 deaths caused by exposure to secondhand smoke in the State of Nevada; 
(17)  Preventing the display of tobacco products or paraphernalia will reduce the number of adolescents who use tobacco products, while still affording tobacco companies numerous ways to communicate product information and provide other advertising to their legal adult customers; 
(18)  Reno City Council desires to reduce adolescent smoking and the public health consequences of smoking without prohibiting the sale of tobacco paraphernalia to adult consumers; 
(19)  The purpose of this legislation is to further the strong governmental interest in protecting the health of its citizens, and particularly its children, by restricting sales to juveniles and the display of tobacco paraphernalia in retail environments that are open to children; and 
(20)  This measure does not restrict expressive conduct any more than necessary and will leave tobacco companies with reasonable and adequate ways to communicate non-misleading commercial information to their legal adult customers.

Chapter 5.21. - MEDICAL MARIJUANA ESTABLISHMENTS 
 
Sec. 5.21.005. - Findings. 
The Reno City Council finds and declares as follows: 
(1)  The Constitution of the State of Nevada Article 4, Section 38 directs the State of Nevada legislature to provide for, among other things, the authorization of appropriate methods to supply marijuana to patients authorized to use it for medical purposes. The 2013 Nevada Legislature enacted Senate Bill 374 (Chapter 457, Statutes of Nevada 2013) significantly amending NRS Chapters 372A (Tax on Controlled Substances) and Chapter 453A (Medical Use of Marijuana) to provide for exemption from criminal prosecution and the certification, taxation and regulation of medical marijuana establishments, which include dispensaries, cultivation facilities, testing laboratories and production facilities of edible marijuana products by the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services (the division). The 2017 Nevada Legislature enacted Senate Bill 487 and Assembly Bill 422 which transferred the responsibility for the regulation of medical marijuana establishments to the Nevada Department of Taxation (the department); and 
(2)  NRS 453A.324 provides that the department shall issue up to 13 registration certificates to operate medical marijuana dispensaries in the various local jurisdictions within Washoe County and shall further determine the appropriate number of other types of medical marijuana establishments and issue registration certificates to operate within the local jurisdictions in Washoe County. The city currently has four medical marijuana dispensaries; and 
(3)  NRS 453A.326 provides that if a local jurisdiction issues business licenses, the registration certificate issued by the department is deemed to be provisional until a business license is issued and the medical marijuana establishment is in compliance with all applicable rules and ordinances of the local jurisdiction; and 
(4)  To the extent that medical marijuana establishments are registered and authorized by the State of Nevada to operate in the corporate limits of the city, this city council desires to provide for their licensing and regulation to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to regulate the use of buildings, structures, land use and business and other purposes; and 
(5)  Since the use, cultivation, distribution, production, possession and transportation of marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and marijuana remains classified as a Class I controlled substance by both Nevada and federal law, those involved with medical marijuana establishments may still be prosecuted under the Federal Controlled Substance Act ("CSA") regardless of whether the medical marijuana establishment is in compliance with state law or has received a license to operate a medical marijuana establishment in the city. The enforcement of the CSA is left to federal prosecutors who decide which cases to prosecute when weighing all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General. Previous nationwide guidance to federal prosecutors specific to marijuana enforcement was rescinded by Attorney General Jefferson B. Session's Memorandum dated January 4, 2018. This chapter is intended to implement NRS 453A and to establish criteria for the issuance of licenses that are a prerequisite for the exemption from state prosecution provided for in NRS 453A. A license issued pursuant to this chapter does not provide any exception, defense or immunity to any person in regard to any potential criminal liability the person may have for the possession, use, consumption, purchase, transportation or cultivation of marijuana under federal law. The city council does not have the authority to, and nothing in this chapter is intended to, authorize, promote, condone or aid the possession, use, consumption, purchase, transportation or cultivation of marijuana in violation of any applicable law, including, without limitation, the CSA; and 
(6)  The city council declares that this chapter is an exercise of the regulatory powers delegated to the city council pursuant to the city charter and NRS 268. The regulations contained in this chapter involve, to the highest degree, the economic, social, physical and moral well-being of the residents and taxpayers of the city. The cultivation, distribution, production and sale of medical marijuana is not a matter of right but of privilege which would otherwise be unlawful under state law if it were not conducted pursuant to NRS 453A, local land use regulations and a license under this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to confer any claim of entitlement to any benefit which might otherwise devolve upon any licensee. This privilege may be denied, revoked, conditioned, suspended or subjected to any other disciplinary action by the city in the exercise of its police powers for the protection of the safety, welfare, health, peace and morals of the residents and taxpayers thereof. Medical marijuana establishments shall cooperate with the city and each of its departments in the exercise of their duties under this chapter.

Notwithstanding any future revisions in the Nevada Constitution or Nevada Revised Statutes which authorizes recreational use of marijuana, the provisions contained herein authorizing medical marijuana establishments within the city do not apply to the recreational use of marijuana, which is set forth in chapter 5.22.

Chapter 5.22. - MARIJUANA ESTABLISHMENTS 
 
Sec. 5.22.005. - Findings. 
The Reno City Council finds and declares as follows: 
(1)  On November 8, 2016, statewide ballot question number 2 (question 2) was passed by Nevada voters, legalizing the recreational use of marijuana by individuals aged 21 or over. Question 2 was codified as NRS Chapter 453D which exempts a person who is 21 years of age or older from state or local prosecution for possession, use, consumption, purchase, transportation or cultivation of certain amounts of marijuana. 
(2)  NRS 453D.210(5)(d)(2) provides that the department shall issue up to twenty licenses to operate retail marijuana stores in the various local jurisdictions within Washoe County. The department's regulations allocate retail marijuana stores by population, and up to ten of retail marijuana stores may be allocated to the city; and 
(3)  To the extent that marijuana establishments are licensed by the department to operate in the corporate limits of the city, this city council desires to provide for their licensing and regulation to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to regulate the use of buildings, structures, land use and business and other purposes; and 
(4)  Since the use, cultivation, distribution, production, possession and transportation of marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and marijuana remains classified as a Class I controlled substance by both Nevada and federal law, those involved with marijuana establishments may still be prosecuted under the Federal Controlled Substance Act ("CSA") regardless of whether the marijuana establishment is in compliance with state law or has received a license to operate a marijuana establishment in the city. The enforcement of the CSA is left to federal prosecutors who decide which cases to prosecute when weighing all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the attorney general. Previous nationwide guidance to federal prosecutors specific to marijuana enforcement was rescinded by Attorney General Jefferson B. Session's Memorandum dated January 4, 2018. A license issued pursuant to this chapter does not provide any exception, defense or immunity to any person in regard to any potential criminal liability the person may have for possession, use, consumption, purchase, transportation or cultivation of marijuana under federal law. The city council does not have the authority to, and nothing in this chapter is intended to, authorize, promote, condone or aid the possession, use, consumption, purchase, transportation or cultivation of marijuana in violation of any applicable law, including, without limitation, the CSA; and 
(6)  The city council declares that this chapter is an exercise of the regulatory powers delegated to the city council pursuant to the city charter and NRS Chapter 268. The regulations contained in this chapter involve, to the highest degree, the economic, social, physical and moral well-being of the residents and taxpayers of the city. The possession, use, consumption, purchase, transportation, cultivation, and sale of marijuana is not a matter of right but of privilege which would otherwise be unlawful under state law if it were not conducted pursuant to NRS 453D, local land use regulations and a license under this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to confer any claim of entitlement to any benefit which might otherwise devolve upon any licensee. This privilege may be denied, revoked, conditioned, suspended or subjected to any other disciplinary action by the city in the exercise of its police powers for the protection of the safety, welfare, health, peace and morals of the residents and taxpayers thereof. Marijuana establishments shall cooperate with the city and each of its departments in the exercise of their duties under this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 6467, § 3, 6-6-18)  
Sec. 5.22.006. - Purpose and short title. 
This chapter establishes the minimum procedural requirements for business licenses issued by the city, and shall be known as the Marijuana Establishment Code.

The city initially authorizes up to eight retail marijuana stores, with up to four retail marijuana store licenses being provided to existing medical marijuana dispensaries as dual licensees, and up to four new retail marijuana licensees to new retail marijuana stores. The issuance of city licenses for marijuana establishments, including retail marijuana stores, will be considered in order of the department's rankings pursuant to the regulations.

If a license tax is collected in whole, or in part, on a percentage of the gross revenue of the marijuana establishment, the gross revenue of the marijuana establishment shall be determined by using the same method the department uses to calculate the sales price of the marijuana for purposes of excise taxes due to the state under the regulations and NRS Chapters 372A and 453D. The marijuana establishment shall provide to the city, and authorizes the department to provide to the city, all information the marijuana establishment provided to the department, as required by the regulations and NRS Chapters 372A and 453D, to determine the gross revenue of the marijuana establishment, and grants the city the same powers as granted to the department pursuant to the regulations and NRS Chapters 372A and 453D.

The rights reserved to the City with respect to the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved by any applicable franchise agreement or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to same shall in any way affect, or diminish, any other right the City may otherwise have. 
(c)  Complaint procedure. The Cable Operator shall establish written procedures, which are consistent with this article, for receiving, acting upon, and resolving Subscriber complaints, and crediting Subscriber accounts and shall publicize such procedures through printed documents at the Cable Operator's sole expense. Said written procedures shall prescribe a simple manner in which any Subscriber may submit a complaint by telephone, FAX, E-mail, in-person, or in writing to the Cable Operator that it has violated any provision of this article, any terms or conditions of the Subscriber's contract with the Cable Operator, or reasonable business practices. At the conclusion of the Cable Operator's investigation of a Subscriber complaint, but in no more than 15 calendar days after receiving the complaint, the Cable Operator shall notify the Subscriber of the results of its investigation and its proposed action or credit. The Cable Operator shall also notify the Subscriber of the Subscriber's right to file a complaint with the City in the event the Subscriber is dissatisfied with the Cable Operator's decision, and shall thoroughly explain the necessary procedures for filing such complaint with the City. The Cable Operator shall immediately report all Subscriber complaints that it does not find valid to the City. A copy of the Cable Operator's complaint procedures, and changes to thereof, shall be provided to the City prior to implementation. 
(d)  Complaints to the City. Pursuant to NRS 711.250, any Subscriber who is dissatisfied with any decision of the Cable Operator or who has not received a decision within the 15-day period as required shall be entitled to have the complaint reviewed by the City. The Subscriber may initiate the review either by calling the City or by filing a written complaint together with the Cable Operator's written decision, if any, with the City Clerk. The Subscriber shall make such filing and notification within 60 days of receipt of the Cable Operator's decision or, if no decision has been provided, within 90 days after filing the original complaint with the Cable Operator. If the City decides that further evidence is warranted, the City shall require the Cable Operator and the Subscriber to submit, within ten days of notice thereof, a written statement of the facts and arguments in support of their respective positions. The Cable Operator and the Subscriber shall produce any additional evidence, including any reports from the Cable Operator, which the City may deem necessary to an understanding and determination of the complaint. The City's hearing officer shall issue a determination within 15 days after examining the materials submitted, setting forth its basis for the determination. The City's hearing officer may extend these time limits for reasonable cause and may intercede and attempt to negotiate an informal resolution. If the City's hearing officer determines that the Subscriber's complaint is valid and that the Cable Operator did not provide the complaining Subscriber with the proper solution and/or credit, the hearing officer may reverse any decision of the Cable Operator in the matter, and provide an appropriate amount of money to the Subscriber, in lieu of a credit, by means of a withdrawal from the Security Fund.

Sec. 6.06.170. - Spectators prohibited at illegal speed racing and other speed violations. 
(a)  Preamble. 
(1)  The Reno City Council finds and declares that: 
a.  Pursuant to Reno Municipal Code section 6.06.695, motor vehicle speed racing and other speed violations on alleys, highways, roadways and streets are illegal. 
b.  Street racing threatens the health and safety of the public, interferes with pedestrian and vehicular traffic, damages private property, creates a public nuisance and interferes with the right of private business owners to enjoy the use of their property within the City of Reno. 
c.  Illegal street races occur on a regular basis on various streets within the city. Large numbers of racers and spectators gather on these streets late at night and in the early morning hours, blocking the streets and sidewalks to traffic, forming a racetrack area, placing bets, and otherwise encouraging, aiding and abetting the racing process. 
d.  Illegal street races attract large numbers of spectators. The mere presence of spectators at these events fuels the illegal street racing and creates an environment in which these illegal activities can flourish. 
(2)  This section is adopted to prohibit spectators at illegal street races with the aim of significantly curbing criminal activity. It targets a very clear, limited population and gives proper notice to citizens as to what activities are lawful and what activities are unlawful. In discouraging spectators, the act of organizing and participating in illegal street races will be discouraged. 
(b)  Definitions. 
(1)  "Speed racing or other speed violations" means any violation referred to in Reno Municipal Code section 6.06.695. 
(2)  "Preparations" for "Speed racing or other speed violations" include, but are not limited to, situations in which:

c.  A group of individuals has gathered on private property open to the general public without the consent of the owner, operator, or agent thereof for the purpose of participating in or being a spectator at the event; 
d.  One or more individuals has impeded the free public use of a public street or highway by actions, words, or physical barriers for the purpose of conducting the event; 
e.  Two or more vehicles have lined up with motors running for an illegal motor vehicle speed contest or exhibition of speed; 
f.  One or more drivers is revving his engine or spinning his tires in preparation for the event; or 
g.  An individual is stationed at or near one or more motor vehicles serving as a race starter. 
(3)  Spectator means any individual who is present at an illegal motor vehicle speed race or other speed violations or at a location where preparations are being made for such activities, for the purpose of viewing, observing, watching, or witnessing the event as it progresses. Spectator includes any individual at the location of the event without regard to whether the individual arrived at the event by driving a vehicle, riding as a passenger in a vehicle, walking, or arriving by some other means. 
(c)  Any individual who is knowingly present as a spectator, either on a public street or highway, or on private property open to the general public without the consent of the owner, operator, or agent thereof, at an illegal motor vehicle speed race or other speed violations is guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(d)  Any individual who is knowingly present as a spectator, either on a public street or highway, or on private property open to the general public without the consent of the owner, operator, or agent thereof, where preparations are being made for an illegal motor vehicle speed race or other speed violations is guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(e)  An individual is present at the illegal motor vehicle speed race or other speed violations if that individual is within 200 feet of the location of the event, or within 200 feet of the location where preparations are being made for the event. 
(f)  Any individual who for the purpose of facilitating or aiding or as an incident to any speed racing or other speed violations upon an alley, highway, roadway, or street in any manner obstructs or places any barricade or obstruction or assist or participate in placing any barricade or obstruction is guilty of a misdemeanor.

(a)  When the traffic-control signal is circular green alone: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing such signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless another device at such place prohibits either or both such turns. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
(2)  Pedestrians facing such a signal may proceed across the highway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk, unless directed otherwise by another device as provided in section 6.06.735 (right-of-way in crosswalks). 
(b)  Where the traffic-control signal is circular green with a turn arrow: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing such a signal may proceed to make the movement indicated by the green turn arrow or such other movement as is permitted by the circular green signal, but such traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection at the time such signal is exhibited. Drivers turning in the direction of the arrow when displayed with the circular green signal are thereby advised that so long as a turn arrow is illuminated, oncoming or opposing traffic simultaneously faces a steady red signal. 
(2)  Pedestrians facing such a signal may proceed across the highway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk, unless directed otherwise by another device as provided in section 6.06.735 (right-of-way in crosswalks). 
(c)  Where the traffic-control signal is a green turn arrow alone: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing such a signal may proceed only in the direction indicated by the arrow signal so long as the arrow is illuminated, but such traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within the adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(2)  Pedestrians facing such a signal shall not enter the highway until permitted to proceed by another device as provided in section 6.06.735 (right-of-way in crosswalks). 
(d)  Where the traffic-control signal is a green straight through arrow alone: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing such a signal may proceed through but shall not turn right or left. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
(2)  Pedestrians facing such a signal may proceed across the highway within the appropriate marked or unmarked crosswalk, unless directed otherwise by another device as provided in section 6.06.735 (right-of-way in crosswalks). 
(e)  Where the traffic-control signal is a steady yellow signal alone: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing such a signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a steady red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and such vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection when the red signal is exhibited. 
(2)  Pedestrians facing such a signal, unless otherwise directed by another device as provided in section 6.06.735 (right-of-way in crosswalks), are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the highway. 
(f)  Where the signal is a flashing yellow turn arrow, displayed alone or in combination with another signal: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing the signal is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow signal, or other such movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such vehicular traffic must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk and yield the right-of-way to other traffic lawfully in the intersection. 
(2)  Pedestrians facing such a signal, unless otherwise directed by another device as provided in section 6.06.735 (right-of-way in crosswalks), are thereby advised that there may be insufficient time to cross the highway, but may proceed across the highway within the appropriate marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(g)  Where the signal is a steady red signal alone: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing such a signal shall stop in all cases before entering the intersection, and shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the nearest side of the intersection where the sign or pavement marking indicates where the stop shall be made, or in the absence of any such crosswalk, sign or marking, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain stopped or standing until the green signal is shown. 
(2)  Pedestrians facing such a signal shall not enter the highway unless permitted to proceed by another device as provided in section 6.06.735 (right-of-way in crosswalks). 
(3)  Vehicular traffic facing such a signal and situated on the extreme right of the highway after stopping may proceed into the intersection for a right turn only when the intersecting highway is two-directional or one-way to the right, or vehicular traffic facing such a signal and situated on the extreme left of a one-way highway may proceed into the intersection for a left turn only when the intersecting highway is one-way to the left, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection. 
(4)  Where the signal is a steady red arrow alone, vehicular traffic facing such a signal shall stop in all cases before entering the intersection, and shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the nearest side of the intersection where the sign or pavement marking indicates where the stop shall be made, or in the absence of any such crosswalk, sign or marking then before entering the intersection, and shall remain stopped or standing until the green turn arrow is shown. 
(h)  Where the signal is a steady red with a green turn arrow then: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing such a signal may enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the green turn arrow, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. Drivers turning in the direction of the arrow are thereby advised that so long as the turn arrow is illuminated, oncoming or opposing traffic simultaneously faces a steady red signal. 
(2)  Pedestrians facing such a signal shall not enter the highway unless permitted to proceed by another device as provided in section 6.06.735 (right-of-way in crosswalks). 
(i)  If a traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions, which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or pavement marking indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such device, the stop shall be made at the signal. 
(j)  Whenever traffic-control signals are placed over the individual lanes of a highway, such signals shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles as follows: 
(1)  A downward-pointing green arrow means that a driver facing such signal may drive in any lane over which the green signal is shown. 
(2)  A red "X" symbol means a driver facing such signal shall not enter or drive in any lane over which such red signal is shown.

CHAPTER 6.07. - RESIDENTIAL PERMIT PARKING[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 3397 § 1, adopted May 27, 1986, amended the Code by adding provisions designated as Ch. 6.07, §§ 6.07.010—6.07.040. In order to avoid duplication of section numbers, however, the editor has redesignated § 6.07.020, permit required, application, as § 6.07.030; and §§ 6.07.030, 6.07.040 as §§ 6.07.040. 6.07.050, respectively. Subsequently, Ord. No. 5990, adopted December 12, 2007, amended Ch. 6.07, in its entirety, to read as herein set out. See also the Code Comparative Table. 
 
Sec. 6.07.010. - Definitions. 
(a)  For the purposes of this chapter, the term "resident" shall be deemed to mean a person who customarily resides and maintains a place of abode within the permit parking district, exclusive of University of Nevada-Reno property within (i) a single-family dwelling having an address on a public street within an existing residential parking permit area, (ii) where lawful, a two-family dwelling having an address on a public street within an existing residential parking permit area, and (iii) a multi-family dwelling (a structure arranged or designed to be occupied by three or more families) having an address on a public street within an existing residential parking permit area, but only if, in the determination of the city's traffic engineer, such multifamily dwelling does not have sufficient off street parking spaces to meet the city's minimum off street parking requirements for new construction. A rental unit without a full kitchen, such as a room and bath, shall not qualify as an individual dwelling unit for purposes of determining whether a dwelling is a single-, two- or multi-family dwelling. 
(b)  For purposes of this chapter, the term "visitor" shall mean a person who, for a short period of time visits a resident within the parking permit district and who solely by reason of that visit needs a temporary place to park (including, without limitation a person who is employed and actually at work within such household). The term visitor does not mean or include a person who meets the definition of a resident as defined in this section. A visitor may not use or attempt to use a visitor permit to park in a residential parking permit district while he or she attends school, college classes or work in or near such zone. 
(c)  For the purposes of this chapter, the term "homeowner or long-term resident" shall mean an owner/occupant who (1) is an owner of record of the property as shown on the most recent Washoe County Assessor's tax roll, and (2) occupies a dwelling on the property for a minimum of 6 months of each calendar year. A "homeowner or long-term resident" includes a person who does not own the property but has resided at the address associated with the property for more than four years. 
(Ord. No. 3397, § 1, 5-27-86; Ord. No. 5990, § 1, 12-12-07; Ord. No. 6398, § 1, 4-27-16)  
Sec. 6.07.020. - Designation of area and restrictions. 
The city council may establish a particular area as a residential permit parking district upon the completion of the following: 
(1)  The city traffic engineer shall conduct a study to ascertain whether parking spaces on the streets within a particular residential area are used for the parking of vehicles not belonging to residents to such an extent as to create congestion, excessive noise, air pollution, and cause the residents of the area unreasonable burdens in gaining access to their residences, and 
(2)  If the majority of the contiguous property owners to the streets in such an area, or portion thereof, do not object to the establishment of a permit parking area, the city council may then establish such area as a residential permit parking district. 
(3)  Permits issued shall be limited to actual on-street parking spaces available as determined by the traffic engineer or his or her designee. Once capacity has been reached, no additional permits shall be issued for the period. 
(4)  Permits shall be limited to one permit per bedroom of the address associated with the property as determined by the Washoe County Assessor. 
(5)  Residents residing in developments that have been granted parking reductions by the City of Reno are not eligible to receive residential or visitor parking permits. 
(6)  No permits will be issued to the residents of multi-family dwellings. 
(Ord. No. 3397, § 1, 5-27-86; Ord. No. 5990, § 1, 12-12-07; Ord. No. 6398, § 1, 4-27-16)  
Sec. 6.07.030. - Permit required, application and requirements. 
(a)  Unless a valid zone parking permit is properly displayed, no vehicle shall be parked upon any street or public way within a permit parking district. 
(b)  Residents within a permit parking district may apply to the city clerk's office for a permit to park their vehicle(s) upon the streets or public ways of the permit parking district in which such applicant resides. All outstanding citations must be paid prior to issuances of a permit. Failure to remedy the balance shall result in denial of the issuance of permits. 
(c)  Each applicant shall submit a completed application, current proof of residency and current motor vehicle registration issued by a state department of motor vehicles. Acceptable forms of proof of residence will be as follows depending on whether a Resident, Homeowner or Long-Term Resident: 
(1)  A real estate tax statement; 
(2)  A deed; 
(3)  A municipal water or utility bill; with the applicant's name; 
(4)  Homeowner's insurance policy; 
(5)  Voter's registration; or 
(6)  A current lease/rental agreement. 
(d)  Once proof of residency is assured by the city clerk and payment of the fee is made, the residential parking permit may be issued. 
(e)  The resident permit shall be placed and displayed in the windshield area in front of the rearview mirror in a manner as not to interfere with the vision of the operator. The permit shall not be obstructed by any object, and all permit information shall be clearly visible. 
(f)  A fee shall be charged pursuant to the fee schedule as adopted by the Reno City Council for the issuance of each permit or replacement permit, and such fee shall be used by the city to defray the cost of enforcement of the provisions of this chapter. 
(g)  Permits issued under the provisions of this chapter shall be valid commencing either January first and expiring June thirtieth of the same year or commencing July first and expiring December thirty-first of the same year for non-homeowners or non-long-term residents. Homeowners and long-term residents will be issued an annual permit, valid commencing July first and expiring June thirtieth of the next calendar year. 
(h)  A permit issued under the provisions of this chapter shall be personal, nonassignable and nontransferable. Each such permit shall be valid only for a specifically prescribed vehicle. 
(i)  Except as provided herein, each address may receive one visitor pass at no additional charge. Violations in the use of the visitor pass will result in the revocation of such pass issued to the address. 
(j)  Multi-family dwellings in excess of 20 units, may apply for and receive one visitor pass per every five units at the property. Passes will be issued to the owner of the property, and must be managed and maintained by the owner of the property. 
(k)  Owners of a property within the residential permit program not residing in the home (i.e. landlord) may apply for a temporary 48 hour landlord pass through the city clerk's office. The fee for such temporary passes shall be pursuant to the fee schedule as adopted by the Reno City Council, and shall be limited to ten per calendar year. 
(Ord. No. 3397, § 1, 5-27-86; Ord. No. 5990, § 1, 12-12-07; Ord. No. 6398, § 1, 4-27-16)  
Sec. 6.07.040. - Exceptions. 
The parking prohibitions of this chapter shall not apply to clearly marked service or delivery vehicles which are being used to provide temporary services to or make immediate deliveries to residents of the permit parking district. 
(Ord. No. 3397, § 1, 5-27-86; Ord. No. 5990, § 1, 12-12-07)  
Sec. 6.07.050. - Violations. 
(a)  In any prosecution charging a violation of this chapter, proof that the vehicle described in the complaint, summons or warrant was parked in violation of this chapter, together with proof that the defendant was at the time of such parking the registered owner of the vehicle, shall constitute in evidence a prima facie presumption that such registered owner of the vehicle was the person who parked the vehicle at the place where, and for the time during which, such violation occurred. 
(b)  If any person transfers, or allows to use or possess any parking permit issued to him/her, or gives false answers upon application therefor, or uses or continues to use such parking permit after termination or expiration thereof by expiration of time or operation of law or cessation of residence, or violates any of the terms, conditions, rules or regulations applicable to same, such person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(Ord. No. 3397, § 1, 5-27-86; Ord. No. 5990, § 1, 12-12-07)  
Sec. 6.07.060. - Individual resident parking.

(b)  The public works department, upon receipt of a written request for "resident parking only," will conduct a preliminary study to be completed within 30 days. A report of the findings, together with a recommendation, will be forwarded to the city manager within 60 days of receipt of the request. 
(c)  If the request is granted, the applicant shall pay the cost of signing the area in the amount in accordance with a set list of fees approved by the city council and kept on file in the office of the city engineer. Senior citizen applicants, said persons being over 65 years of age, shall pay signage costs at a reduced rate. Said signage fee will be in effect for one year, or until such time as an examination of the condition of the sign determines replacement is necessary. If so, the costs of replacement will be borne by the applicant. 
(d)  Disabled residents issued a parking permit or license plate by the Nevada State Department of Motor Vehicles and Public Safety pursuant to NRS 482.384 or NRS 482.377 will be given special considerations if existing off-street parking can not be accessed by the resident. 
(e)  If two off-street parking spaces exist, such as garage space and/or driveway space long enough to accommodate a vehicle, no "resident parking only" spaces will be granted, unless otherwise provided in subsection (d). 
(f)  If one off-street space or less is provided, "resident parking only" zones may be considered, if over a five-day period the public works department determines that a "resident parking only" zone is in the best interest of the area residents and fulfills the requirements of the other parameters of this section. 
(g)  Controlled parking/access streets will not be considered for "resident parking only" zones. 
(h)  The public works department will review existing and future "resident parking only" locations every five years, at which time a new engineering study will be performed to determine requisite compliance. 
(i)  The public works department reserves the right to discontinue any and all "resident parking only" zone permits, if it is determined that any of the following conditions exist: 
(1)  The applicant vacated the residence; 
(2)  The zone no longer qualifies under any and all subsections (b) through (l); 
(3)  The continued use of the zone is determined to be unsafe or the street classification changes by engineering study. 
(j)  If the zone is discontinued, a financial reimbursement will be made by the city on a prorated basis. Discontinuance must be accompanied by a 30-day written notice by either party. 
(k)  The city council may waive any or all of the signing fee for any applicant upon a finding of special circumstances. 
(l)  A residential parking permit issued under this section shall be limited to single-family residences only, except permits approved by the city manager prior to date of adoption.

The traffic engineer may cause to be marked off individual parking spaces in the parking zones designated in section 6.08.010 and in such other districts as may hereafter be established, such parking spaces to be designated by lines painted or durably marked on the curbing or surface of the street. At each space so marked off it shall be unlawful to park any vehicle in such a way that the vehicle shall not be entirely within the limits of the space so designated.

Upon the transaction of such payment the parking space may be lawfully occupied by such vehicle during the period of time which has been prescribed for the parking space, provided that any person placing a vehicle in a parking meter space controlled by a meter which indicates that unused time has been left in the meter by the previous occupant of the space shall not be required to transact payment so long as his occupancy of the space does not exceed the indicated unused parking time. When each device indicates the expiration of the lawful time limit, the lawful parking period has expired and in such cases the right of such vehicle to occupy such space shall cease and the operator, owner, possessor or manager thereof shall be subject to the penalties provided in this Code.

(a)  Upon receipt of an affidavit by the Reno Police Department or the public works director which states that either of the conditions which are set forth in section 6.30.530(a) or (b) exists and requests the use of the immobilizer, the Reno Municipal Court Judge may issue an order to immobilize the vehicle, the registration of which is shown on the notice of infraction which forms the basis of the civil action in which the complaint and summons or the judgment, as the case may be, was issued. 
(b)  The order to immobilize must declare, among other things: 
(1)  That the vehicle has been immobilized for failure to pay the civil fine in connection with a notice of infraction within 45 days after its issuance; 
(2)  That it is a misdemeanor for any unauthorized person to deface, injure, tamper with, open, break, destroy or remove the immobilizer, impair the usefulness thereof or attempt to do any of those acts; 
(3)  That the registered owner of the vehicle is afforded a hearing in the Reno Municipal Court on the following day to show cause why the vehicle should not be impounded; and 
(4)  That, if the registered owner or owner's agent does not appear at the scheduled hearing, an order to impound the vehicle shall be issued.

(a)  If an immobilizer is placed on the vehicle, a copy of the order to immobilize must be affixed thereto, and the registered owner must be afforded a hearing in the Reno Municipal Court on the following day to show cause why the vehicle should not be impounded. In no case may a vehicle be immobilized on a day which precedes a day on which the court is not in session. 
(b)  At the hearing, the registered owner or his/her agent may present such evidence and argument as he deems appropriate in order to persuade the court not to enter an order to impound. The court must order the immobilizer to be removed if the owner pays a $50.00 removal fee, plus the civil fine, in connection with the notice of infraction with respect to which the immobilizer was placed on the vehicle, if a judgment in respect of the notice of infraction has been entered or if the owner does not desire a trial on that infraction. If a judgment in respect of that notice of infraction has not been entered and the owner desires a trial on that infraction, the court must set a date for that trial and order the immobilizer to be removed, if the owner pays the $50.00 removal fee and agrees to appear for trial.

(b)  The notice to immobilize must state among other things: 
(1)  That the vehicle has been immobilized for having five or more notices of infraction which have not been responded to by the registered owner and/or operator of such vehicle, after being warned that repeated violations may result in the impounded or immobilizing the vehicle; 
(2)  That it is a misdemeanor for any unauthorized person to deface, injure, tamper with, open, break, destroy or remove the immobilizer, impair the usefulness thereof or attempt to do any of those acts; 
(3)  That the registered owner of the vehicle is afforded a hearing before a hearing officer on the following day to determine whether there was probable cause to immobilize the vehicle and why the vehicle should not be impounded; and 
(4)  That if the registered owner or owner's agent does not appear at the scheduled hearing, an order to impound the vehicle shall be issued.

(3)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a written decision and a copy of such decision shall be provided to the person requesting the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer may be appealed to the Reno Municipal Court as set forth in section 6.30.090 of this chapter. Failure of the registered owner or the owner's agent to request or attend such a scheduled post-seizure hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to such hearing. 
(4)  The hearing officer shall determine whether there was probable cause to immobilize the vehicle and, in appropriate cases, whether fees and charges should be reduced in the interest of justice. In the event that the hearing officer determines that the vehicle should be released without fees or with a reduction in fees, the hearing officer shall prepare and date a written waiver of such fees. Copies of the waiver shall be furnished the vehicle owner or vehicle owner's agent and the police department. The vehicle shall then be released to the owner or the owner's agent for fees paid to recover the vehicle from impound. If the hearing officer determines the immobilization was justified pursuant to subsection (3) of section 6.30.530, the owner or his agent shall be responsible for costs of removal fees of $50.00, plus civil fines, in connection with the notices of infraction. 
(d)  In the event the registered owner or his/her agent does not appear, or does not pay the removal fee and refuses to pay the civil fines, the hearing officer shall enter an order to impound the vehicle. In hardship cases, the hearing officer may allow the fines to be paid in installments.

b.  A statement urging the alarm user to ensure that the alarm system is properly operated, inspected, and serviced in order to avoid false alarms and resulting false alarm fees. 
c.  The false alarm fees recorded. 
(4)  The alarm administrator may require that a conference be held with an alarm user and the alarm installation company or monitoring company responsible for repairing or monitoring of the alarm system to review the circumstances of each false alarm. The conference may be held in person or through a conference telephone call, at the alarm administrator's discretion. Failure to participate will result in suspension of either the alarm permit, the security alarm license, or both as indicated by the facts of the case. Reinstatement after compliance will require payment of an additional permit fee for the alarm user or will be under the terms of subsection (i)(14) for alarm installation companies and monitoring companies. 
(5)  The alarm administrator may establish an alarm user awareness class. The alarm administrator may request the assistance of associations, alarm companies and law enforcement agencies in developing and implementing the class. The class shall inform alarm users of the problems created by false alarms and teach alarm users how to avoid creating false alarms. 
(6)  If a false holdup alarm has occurred and the alarm was triggered using a single action, non-recessed button, the alarm administrator may consider a waiver of the false alarm fee if action is taken by the alarm user to remove or replace the single action, non-recessed button. 
(7)  The alarm administrator will make a copy of this ordinance and/or an ordinance summary sheet available to each alarm user. 
(l)  False alarm fees.   
(1)  False alarm fees. An alarm user shall pay fees to the alarm administrator for police response to any false alarm. The fees charged pursuant to this title shall be contained in the fee schedule which shall be maintained by the police department, and amended upon approval of the city council. 
(2)  If a false alarm fee is not paid within 30 days after the invoice is mailed, a late fee will be imposed. 
(3)  Fees for false alarms by unregistered alarm systems. In addition to the fees set forth in subsections (1) and (2), a supplemental fee is hereby imposed upon any person operating an unregistered alarm system. The alarm administrator may waive this additional fee for an unregistered system if the alarm user submits an application for alarm registration within ten business days after receiving notice of such violation. 
(4)  If cancellation of police response occurs prior to the police officer being dispatched, the response is not considered a false alarm for the purpose of fees, and no penalty will be assessed. 
(5)  The alarm administrator may waive a false alarm fee due to a history of false alarms that is identified as chronic equipment failure. 
(6)  The alarm installation company shall be assessed a fee if the officer responding to the false alarm determines that an on-site employee of the alarm installation company directly caused the false alarm. Such false alarms are not included in the total number of false alarms for the alarm user. 
(7)  A fee is hereby imposed against any monitoring company that fails to verify alarm system signals as required in subsection (i)(9)(b). 
(8)  A fine in the amount of $200.00 is hereby imposed against an alarm installation company if the alarm administrator determines that an employee of the alarm installation company knowingly made a false statement concerning the inspection of an alarm site or the performance of an alarm system. 
(9)  Notice of the right of appeal under this ordinance will be included with notice of any penalty. 
(m)  Notice to alarm users of false alarms and suspension of police response.   
(1)  The alarm administrator shall notify the alarm user in writing after each false alarm. The notice shall include the amount of the fee for the false alarm, the fact that response will be suspended after the third false alarm during the permit year, (excluding duress, holdup and panic alarms) and a description of the appeals procedure available to the alarm user. 
(2)  The alarm administrator shall notify the alarm user and the alarm installation company or monitoring company in writing 30 days before an alarm response is to be suspended. Suspension of alarm response does not apply to duress, robbery, holdup and panic alarms. The notice of suspension must also include the amount of the fine for each false alarm and a description of the appeals procedure available to the alarm user and the alarm installation company or monitoring company. 
(n)  Violation to make alarm dispatch request for suspended alarm site.   
(1)  The alarm administrator shall notify the police department of each alarm user whose intrusion alarm permit qualifies for suspension under this section. The alarm administrator shall suspend an intrusion alarm permit if it is determined that: 
a.  The alarm user has had three or more false intrusion alarms within one year after the date of issuance of their annual permit, except that the alarm administrator may waive a suspension of a permit upon receipt of documented work orders showing reasonable attempts to repair the alarm system. The alarm administrator may impose a one week acclimation period upon reinstatement of the permit. 
b.  There is a false statement of a material fact in the application for a permit; or 
c.  The alarm user fails or refuses to pay a false alarm fee or late fee assessed under this section. 
(2)  It is a violation of this section for a person to operate an intrusion alarm system during the period in which the alarm permit is suspended. It is a violation of this section for a monitoring company to make an alarm dispatch request to an intrusion alarm site after the company has been notified by the alarm administrator that the permit for that alarm site has been suspended. The monitoring company must pay a $50.00 fine to the alarm administrator for each such dispatch to an alarm site. If the penalty is not paid to the alarm administrator within 30 days, a late fee is hereby imposed on the monitoring company. 
(3)  Unless there is a separate indication that there is a crime in progress, Emergency Communications shall not dispatch an officer to an intrusion alarm site for which the alarm permit is suspended. 
(4)  If an intrusion alarm permit is reinstated, the police department may again suspend the permit if it is determined that two false alarms have occurred within 180 days after the reinstatement date. The exception set forth in paragraph (n)(1)(a) applies to any such suspension. 
(5)  This subsection applies only to intrusion alarm systems. Holdup alarms, robbery alarms and panic alarms are not subject to suspension. 
(o)  Appeals of determinations regarding alarm permits and fees.   
(1)  If the alarm administrator assesses a fee, suspends an alarm permit or denies the issuance, renewal or reinstatement of an alarm permit, the alarm administrator shall send written notice of the action and a statement of the right to appeal to the affected applicant or alarm user and the alarm installation company or monitoring company. 
(2)  The alarm user, alarm installation company or alarm monitoring company may appeal any action described in (1) above to the chief of police or designee by setting forth in writing the reasons for the appeal and delivering the appeal to the chief of police or designee within 20 business days after receipt of notice of the action. Failure to deliver the appeal within that time period is a waiver of the right to appeal. 
(3)  The procedure for an appeal to the chief of police or designee is as follows: 
a.  The applicant, alarm user, alarm installation company or monitoring company may file a written request for appeal by paying an appeal fee to the police department and setting forth the reasons for the appeal. The appeal must be entitled "Appeal from Alarm Administrator's Action." Appeal fees will be returned to the appealing party if the appeal is successful. Upon good cause shown, the alarm administrator may, in the exercise of discretion, waive the appeal fee for residential alarm users. 
b.  The chief of police or designee shall conduct a recorded hearing within 30 days after receipt of the request for review and shall consider the evidence submitted by the appealing party and the alarm administrator. The chief of police or designee must base the decision on the preponderance of evidence presented at the hearing and must render a decision within 15 days after the date of the hearing. The decision shall affirm or reverse the decision or action taken by the alarm administrator. 
c.  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the chief of police or designee may appeal in accordance with the procedure set forth in Reno Municipal Code 1.05.500, et seq. 
d.  Filing of an appeal stays any action by the alarm administrator to suspend an alarm permit or require the payment of a fee or penalty until the appeal process has been exhausted. This provision applies only to the action of the alarm administrator that is the subject of the appeal. This provision does not operate as a bar to enforcement action on violations of this section that occur thereafter. 
(4)  The alarm administrator or the chief of police, or their respective designees, may adjust the count of false alarms based on: 
a.  Evidence that a false alarm was caused by action of the telephone company; 
b.  Evidence that a false alarm was caused by a power outage; 
c.  Evidence that an alarm dispatch request was not a false alarm; or 
d.  The occurrence of multiple alarms within in a 24-hour period, which may be considered as one false alarm to allow the alarm user time to take corrective action, unless the false alarms are directly caused by the alarm user. 
e.  On review of fees or penalties assessed to an alarm installation company or monitoring company, the alarm administrator, or, if appealed, chief of police, or designee, or the administrative hearing officer, may consider whether the alarm or monitoring company has engaged in a consistent pattern of violations. 
(p)  Reinstatement of suspended alarm permits.   
(1)  On the first suspension of a permit, a person whose alarm permit has been suspended may obtain reinstatement of the permit by the alarm administrator if the person: 
a.  Submits a new application and pays a reinstatement fee; 
b.  Pays, or otherwise resolves, all outstanding fees and penalties; 
c.  Submits a certification from an alarm installation company stating that the alarm system has been inspected and repaired (if necessary) by the alarm installation company; and 
d.  The alarm user successfully completes an on-line alarm awareness class and test. 
(2)  On the second and every subsequent suspension of a permit, reinstatement may be obtained by compliance with (1) above and compliance with any of the following conditions that the alarm administrator may require: 
a.  Proof that an employee of the alarm installation company or monitoring company caused the false alarm. 
b.  Upgrade the alarm control panel to meet SIA Control Panel Standard CP-01. 
c.  A written statement from an independent inspector designated by the chief of police or designee that the alarm system has been inspected and is in good working order. 
d.  Confirmation that all motion detectors are "dual technology" type. 
e.  Confirmation that the alarm system requires two independent zones to trigger before transmitting an alarm signal to the monitoring company. 
f.  Confirmation that the alarm system requires two independent detectors to trigger before transmitting an alarm signal to the monitoring company. 
g.  Certification that the monitoring company will not make an alarm dispatch request unless the need for an officer is confirmed by a listen-in device. This condition does not apply to residential property. 
h.  Certification that the monitoring company will not make an alarm dispatch request unless the need for an officer is confirmed by a camera device. This condition does not apply to residential property. 
i.  Certification that the monitoring company will not make an alarm dispatch request unless the need for an officer is confirmed by a person at the alarm site. 
j.  The alarm user successfully completes an on-line alarm awareness class and test. 
(3)  The police department shall reinstate its response to an intrusion alarm site as soon as is practicable after receiving notice of reinstatement from the alarm administrator. 
(q)  Revocation of alarm permit.   
(1)  The chief of police or designee may revoke an alarm permit if it is determined that: 
a.  There is a violation of this chapter by the alarm user; 
b.  There is a false statement of a material fact in the application for a permit; 
c.  The permitted alarm system has generated more than 12 false alarms during any 12 month period; or 
d.  The alarm user has failed to pay an alarm permit fee or late fee, a late renewal fee or any fee or penalty assessed under this section, more than 30 days after the fee is due. 
(2)  A revocation made pursuant to this section is not subject to administrative review. 
(3)  The chief of police or designee may, for good cause shown, reinstate a permit that has been revoked pursuant to this section. 
(r)  Police department response. The police department will respond to all "in progress" robbery or panic alarms as promptly as possible, taking into account pending calls for service, following notification of the receipt of the alarm from the alarm or monitoring company. 
(s)  Confidentiality of alarm information. All information contained in documents gathered through alarm registrations, the submission of customer lists and in the alarm appeal process must be held in confidence by all employees of the alarm administrator and the City of Reno. Such information is proprietary and is hereby declared confidential and not a public record. Absent special circumstances, such information must not be released to the public or any person other than a law enforcement agency or the applicable alarm user, alarm installation company or alarm monitoring company except pursuant to court order. 
(t)  Scope of police duty; immunities preserved. The issuance of alarm permits does not create a contract between the police department and/or the city and any alarm user, alarm installation company or monitoring company, nor does it create a duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, on the police department to respond to any alarm. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure of the police department to respond to an alarm dispatch request is hereby disclaimed and full governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By applying for an alarm permit, the alarm user acknowledges that the police department response is influenced by the availability of officers, priority of calls, traffic conditions, emergency condition and staffing levels.

(Ord. No. 5850, § 1, 6-28-06)  
Sec. 8.12.015. - Sitting or lying down on public sidewalks in the Downtown Reno Regional Center. 
(a)  Preamble. The Reno City Council finds and declares as follows: 
(1)  Public sidewalks in the Downtown Reno Regional Center are created and maintained for the primary purposes of enabling pedestrians to safely and efficiently move about from place to place, facilitating deliveries of goods and services, and providing convenient access to entertainment, goods and services. 
(2)  The public sidewalks in the Downtown Reno Regional Center are prone to congestion, and should be kept available to serve these primary purposes. 
(3)  Except in places provided therefor or where necessary, sitting or lying on the public sidewalks in the Downtown Reno Regional Center interferes with the primary purposes of the public sidewalks, threatens public safety and damages the public welfare. 
(4)  Pedestrians, particularly the elderly, disabled, or vision impaired are put at increased risk when they must see and navigate around individuals sitting or lying upon the public sidewalk. 
(5)  The public welfare is promoted by an economically healthy downtown area which attracts people to shop, recreate, work and be entertained. These areas provide easily accessible goods and services, employment opportunities, the tax revenues necessary to support essential public services, and economic productivity necessary to maintain and improve property within these areas. 
(6)  In some circumstances people sitting or lying on the sidewalks deter many members of the public from frequenting the downtown area, which contributes to undermining the essential economic vitality of this area. Business failures and relocations can cause vacant buildings which contribute to a spiral of deterioration and blight which harms the public health, safety and welfare. An important factor in protecting public safety is attracting people to the streets and sidewalks of the city's Downtown Reno Regional Center, because the presence of many law abiding citizens serves as a deterrent to crime and increases the public's sense of security and the safety of all. 
(7)  There are numerous other places within the Downtown Reno Regional Center and adjacent areas where sitting or lying down can be accommodated without unduly interfering with the safe flow of pedestrian traffic, impairing commercial activity, threatening public safety or harming the public welfare. The limited regulation of sitting or lying down on sidewalks is both reasonably necessary and appropriately balances the public interest and individual rights. 
(b)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, no person shall sit or lie down upon a public sidewalk, or upon a blanket, chair, stool, or any other object placed upon a public sidewalk in the Downtown Reno Regional Center, which shall be defined as the area within the exterior boundary bounded by the following named streets: commencing at the south right-of-way line of I-80 and the east side of Keystone Avenue, then south along Keystone Avenue to the north bank of the Truckee River then east along the Truckee River to the east side of Arlington Avenue, then south on Arlington Avenue to one parcel south of California Avenue, then east following the south property lines of the parcels located on the south side of California Avenue to one parcel east of Forest Street, then north to the south side of California Avenue, then east to the east side of South Virginia Street, then north along South Virginia Street to the north side of Stewart Street, then east on Stewart Street to the west side of Wells Avenue, then north along Wells Avenue to the south right-of-way line of I-80, then west along I-80 to the east side of Keystone Avenue, the point of beginning. 
(c)  The prohibition in subsection (b) shall not apply to any person: 
(1)  Sitting or lying down on a public sidewalk due to a medical emergency; 
(2)  Who, as the result of a disability, utilizes a wheelchair, walker or similar device to move about the public sidewalk; 
(3)  Operating or patronizing a commercial establishment conducted on the public sidewalk pursuant to a street use permit; or a person participating in or attending a parade, festival, performance, rally, demonstration, meeting, or similar event conducted on the public sidewalk pursuant to a street use or other applicable permit. 
(4)  Sitting on a chair or bench located on the public sidewalk which is supplied by a public agency or by the abutting private property owner; or 
(5)  Sitting on a public sidewalk with a bus stop zone while waiting for public or private transportation. 
Nothing in any of these exceptions shall be construed to permit any conduct which is prohibited by section 8.12.042 of the Reno Municipal Code (blocking of sidewalks). 
(d)  No person shall be charged with a violation of this section unless the person engages in conduct prohibited by this section after having been notified by a law enforcement officer that the conduct violates this section. 
(e)  The provisions of this section are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section or portion of this section, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this section, or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances. 
(f)  Any person who violates this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

(1)  The Truckee River runs from the outlet of Lake Tahoe, through Truckee and directly through downtown Reno on its way to Pyramid Lake, and is an important natural resource shared by our city and surrounding communities. 
(2)  The Truckee River watershed includes all of the land draining into the river, either directly, through our urban storm water system, or into creeks which feed the Truckee River. 
(3)  Once a thriving, wild waterway with hundreds of bird species and 40-pound Lahontan cutthroat trout, the Truckee has been highly degraded over the past century. 
(4)  Proper management of the Truckee River, which provides 85 percent of the water delivered in the Truckee Meadows, is vital to sustaining a healthy community. 
(5)  Unregulated camping in and around the Truckee River threatens to pollute the area's primary source of drinking water, and detracts from the scenic beauty of the river. 
(6)  Limited regulation of camping within the Truckee River Corridor is reasonably necessary to protect and enhance water quality or water resources of the Truckee River and appropriately balances the public interest and individual rights. 
(b)  Unless a permit is obtained in accordance with section 8.23.075 or other applicable provision of the Reno Municipal Code, it shall be unlawful to camp on public property within 350 feet of the shore of the Truckee River within city limits (the "Truckee River Corridor"). For the purpose of this section, "to camp" or "camping" means to use real property of the city for overnight living accommodation purposes such as: 
(1)  Sleeping activities or making preparations to sleep including the laying down of bedding for the purpose of sleeping; 
(2)  Storing personal belongings; 
(3)  Making any fire, other than in a fire or barbecue pit provided or area designated for such use by the city or portable propane grill used according to manufacturer's instructions; 
(4)  Using any tent, shelter, other structure or vehicle for sleeping; or 
(5)  Cooking, other than in a fire or barbecue pit provided or area designated for such use by the city or portable propane grill used according to manufacturer's instructions. 
For purposes of this section, "overnight" is defined as the period from one-half hour after sunset to sunrise. 
The above listed activities constitute camping when it reasonably appears in light of all the circumstances that the participant, in conducting these activities is in fact using the area for overnight living accommodation purposes, regardless of the intent of the participant or the nature of any other activities in which they may also be engaging. 
(c)  The prohibition in subsection (b) shall not apply to any person: 
(1)  Sitting or lying down on public property due to a medical emergency; 
(2)  Who, as the result of a disability, utilizes a wheelchair, walker or similar device to move about the public property; 
(3)  Operating or patronizing a commercial establishment conducted on the public property pursuant to an applicable permit; 
(4)  Participating in or attending a parade, festival, performance, rally, demonstration, meeting, or similar event conducted on public property pursuant to an applicable permit. 
(d)  No person shall be charged with a violation of this section unless the person engages in conduct prohibited by this section after having been notified by a law enforcement officer that the conduct violates this section. 
(e)  The provisions of this section are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section or portion of this section, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this section, or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

ARTICLE V. - SOCIAL HOST 
 
Sec. 8.22.300 - Social host liability. 
(a)  Legislative Findings. The City Council of the City of Reno finds as follows: 
(1)  The City of Reno, pursuant to the police powers delegated to it by the State of Nevada, has the authority to enact laws which promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its residents, and, pursuant to NRS 202.020, is authorized to enact by ordinance additional or broader restrictions on underage drinking than exist by state statute. 
(2)  The occurrence of disruptive gatherings on private property where alcoholic beverages are served to attendees, including underage persons, is a threat to public health, safety, quiet enjoyment of residential property and general welfare, and is harmful to the underage persons themselves. 
(3)  Underage persons often obtain alcoholic beverages at gatherings held at private residences or at rented residential and commercial premises that are under the control of a person who knows or should know of the underage service and/or consumption. Persons responsible for the occurrence of disruptive gatherings on private property over which they have possession or control have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages are neither served to nor consumed by underage persons at these gatherings. 
(4)  Due to the differing nature of responsible persons at a given location, the fact that landlords often do not reside at the property and are not in a position to immediately address the impact of a disruptive gathering, and the transient nature of tenants, it has proven difficult to address disruptive gatherings 
(5)  Problems associated with disruptive gatherings at which alcoholic beverages are served, including those where underage persons are permitted to consume alcoholic beverages, are difficult to prevent and deter unless the City of Reno Police Department has the legal authority to direct the host to disperse the gathering. 
(6)  Persons held responsible for abetting or tolerating disruptive gatherings will be more likely to properly supervise or stop such conduct at gatherings held on property under their possession or control. 
(7)  Law enforcement, fire and other emergency response services personnel are required to respond, sometimes on multiple occasions, to disruptive gatherings on private property, including those at which alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by underage persons. 
(8)  Responses to such gatherings result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources of the City of Reno, which are underwritten by general municipal taxes paid to the city by its taxpayers and residents and delaying police responses to regular and emergency calls to the rest of the city. 
(9)  Such gatherings are deemed a public nuisance. 
(10)  The intent of this article is to protect the public health, safety, quiet enjoyment of residential property, and general welfare. 
(b)  Purposes. The purposes of this article are: 
(1)  To protect public health, safety and general welfare; 
(2)  To enforce laws prohibiting the service to and consumption of alcoholic beverages by underage persons; and 
(3)  To reduce the burden on police, fire and other emergency response services caused by disruptive gatherings, including those where alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by underage persons. 
(4)  To protect and foster the quiet enjoyment of residential property and prevent the disturbance of the peace of persons thereon. 
(c)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
(1)  "Alcoholic beverage" means: 
a.  Beer, ale, porter, stout and other similar fermented beverages, including sake and similar products, or any name or description containing one-half of one percent or more alcohol by volume, brewed or produced from malt, wholly or in part, or from any substitute therefor; 
b.  Any beverage obtained by the fermentation of the natural content of fruits or other agricultural products containing sugar, of not less than one-half of one percent of alcohol by volume; and 
c.  Any distilled spirits commonly referred to as ethyl alcohol, ethanol or spirits of wine in any form, including all dilutions and mixtures thereof from whatever process produced. 
(2)  "Disruptive gathering" means a gathering of three or more persons on any private property, including property used to conduct business, in a manner which creates a public nuisance by disturbing the quiet enjoyment of private or public property by any person or persons. Such disturbances include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Noise which is likely to disturb the peace of persons of reasonable and ordinary sensibilities; 
b.  Excessive traffic that can reasonably be attributed to the gathering; 
c.  Obstruction of public streets by crowds or vehicles; 
d.  Drinking in public; 
e.  Service of alcohol to, or consumption of alcohol by, underage persons; 
f.  Assaults, batteries, fights, or other disturbances of the peace; 
g.  Littering; 
h.  Vandalism; or 
i.  Any other conduct which constitutes a threat to public health, safety, quiet enjoyment of residential property or general welfare. 
(3)  "Juvenile" means any person under the age of 18 years of age. 
(4)  "Residence or other private property" means a home, yard, apartment, condominium, hotel or motel room, or other dwelling unit, or a hall or meeting room, whether occupied on a temporary or permanent basis, whether occupied as a dwelling or for a party or other social function, and whether owned, leased, rented, or used with or without compensation. 
(5)  "Underage person" means any person under 21 years of age. 
(d)  A disruptive gathering is unlawful and constitutes a violation of the Reno Municipal Code. A disruptive gathering may be abated by reasonable means including, but not necessarily limited to: 
(1)  An order requiring the gathering to be disbanded; 
(2)  Citation or arrest of violators under applicable criminal ordinances or state statutes; and/or 
(3)  Issuance of an administrative citation for failure to comply with the requirements of the Reno Municipal Code, as set forth in sections 1.05.200 through 1.05.220. 
Administrative citations shall be issued pursuant to this chapter only after a warning letter has been issued, and violations are successively, repeatedly or continuously committed at a single residence or other private property. The warning letter shall issue upon the second violation within six months at a single residence or other private property. 
After a warning letter is issued for the second violation within six months at a single residence or other private property, administrative citations may be issued beginning with the third violation within six months of the second violation, and thereafter, for each following violation without regard to limitations based on a six-month period. Administrative citations may continue to be issued for each violation until there are no further violations at the residence or other private property for a period of one year. Thereafter, in the case of renewed violations at the single residence or other private property, the six-month period limitation shall renew. 
The city will consider evidence of demonstrable good faith efforts on the part of the property owner to abate the nuisance, even if unsuccessful, when determining whether additional administrative action is needed. Such evidence will also be admissible in any administrative appeal conducted in accordance with RMC chapter 1.05. 
If the offending tenant vacates the property after an administrative process has commenced, the property owner must notify the city. Upon notice, pending administrative actions will be concluded as appropriate. The administrative process will be reinstituted in accordance with the procedure detailed above if there are additional disruptive gatherings with new tenants. 
If the property is sold after an administrative process has commenced, the city must be notified, the purchaser must contact the city to discuss the existing nuisance and measures the purchaser will be taking to abate the nuisance, and all outstanding fines satisfied before the process is concluded. 
(e)  Responsibility for proper property management. Every owner, occupant, lessee or holder of any possessory interest of a residence or other private property within the City of Reno is required to maintain, manage and supervise the property and all persons thereon in a manner so as not to violate the provisions of this section. The owner of the property remains liable for such violations regardless of any contract or agreement with any third party regarding the property. 
(f)  All provisions calling for administrative enforcement will be enforced in accordance with RMC chapter 1.05. 
(g)  The failure to pay administrative fines assessed in accordance with this section may result in a lien being placed upon the property. 
(h)  Protected activities. This section shall not apply to activities protected by Article I of the United States Constitution.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, no warning shall be required if the person is to be excluded for engaging in conduct that:

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 8.30.005. - Policy. 
As an aid in the interpretation and enforcement of this section, the city council finds that: 
(a)  The maintenance and improvement of the quality of life and economic vitality of the City of Reno are significant government interests. 
(b)  The preservation of the health, safety and welfare of all members of the public, including prevention of assault, battery, theft, and disturbances of the peace, as well as other crimes and disorder, are significant government interests. 
(c)  The public has a right to the access to, and use and enjoyment of public property and public places, free from intimidation, fear and unwarranted confrontation. Protection of this right of the public is a significant government interest. The government has a legitimate interest in minimizing fear, intimidation and unwarranted confrontations of the public during the night hours, a time when criminal activity is more likely to occur. 
(d)  Aggressive solicitations threaten these significant government interests by diminishing access to, and use and enjoyment of public places, and also threaten the commercial well being of local businesses, and create an environment of fear, intimidation, and confrontation. 
(e)  Solicitations in certain locations, at certain times affecting a solicitation environment, or in locations where members of the public are less able to avoid solicitations, also threaten these significant government interests. Such solicitations also diminish access to and enjoyment of public places, threaten the commercial well being of local businesses, and create an environment of fear, intimidation, and confrontation. 
(f)  It is the intent of the council to protect the public from persons who engage in aggressive solicitations, or who engage in other methods of solicitation that diminish or prevent the public's right to access to, and use and enjoyment of public places, but without prohibiting any person's such right and without impinging on the use of the public forum by all. 
(g)  Regulation of solicitation is necessary to meet council's intent; to protect quality of life, economic vitality, health, safety and welfare, and the rights of the public.

Monuments of concrete, iron or other lasting material set for the purpose of locating or preserving the lines of any street or property subdivision, or a precise survey reference point or a permanent survey bench mark within the city shall not be removed or disturbed or caused to be removed or disturbed unless permission to do so is first obtained in writing from the city engineer. 
(e)  Protection of adjoining properties. The permittee will at all times and at his own expense preserve and protect from injury any properties adjoining the work. 
(f)  Interference with drainage system. When work performed by the permittee interferes with the established drainage system of any street, provision shall be made by the permittee to provide proper drainage to the satisfaction of the city engineer. 
(g)  Removal of material from street. When any earth, gravel or other excavated material is caused to roll, flow or wash upon any street, the permittee shall cause the same to be removed from the street within 24 hours after deposit. If the earth, gravel or other excavated material so deposited is not removed, the city engineer shall cause such removal and the cost incurred shall be paid by the permittee. 
(h)  Barriers, warning devices. Every permittee shall place around the project such barriers, barricades, lights, warning flags and danger signs as shall be determined by the city engineer to be necessary for the protection of the public. Whenever any permittee fails to provide proper safety devices, within a reasonable time after being notified, such devices may be installed and maintained by the city.

(b)  Notice of beginning of backfilling. The city engineer must be notified by the permittee during the 48 hour period preceding beginning of backfilling of the date and approximate time at which backfilling will be begun. 
(c)  Temporary patching. Temporary patching shall be done by the permittee, and it is the responsibility of the permittee to maintain the temporary patch for a period not to exceed 60 days, or until weather conditions permit placement of the permanent patch. 
(d)  Final restoration of paving surface. The work of final restoration of the paving surface shall be performed by the city under the direction of the city engineer. 
(e)  Resurfacing instead of patching. If the city engineer finds that paving surfaces adjacent to the street opening may be damaged where trenches are made parallel to the street, or where a number of cross trenches are laid in close proximity to one another or where the equipment used may cause such damage, he may require a negotiated contribution from the permittee for the resurfacing in place of patching of such street if the total area of the proposed patch or probably damaged area exceeds 25 percent of the total pavement surfacing between curb faces or between concrete gutter edges in any block. Such negotiations shall be carried on and contributions agreed upon prior to issuance of a permit. Such contribution shall be in lieu of the standard permit fee. 
(f)  Performance of work diligently. After the excavation is commenced, the work to be performed under the permit shall be prosecuted with due diligence to completion. 
(g)  Inspections. The city engineer shall make such inspections as he may deem necessary of all work authorized by a permit.

(b)  A re-creation of fixture unit counts for the structure using building plans acceptable to the director of public works, or 
(c)  Performance of a physical fixture unit count which is accepted by the director of public works. 
(b)  And, the current weighting values. 
(3)  If a structure on a property is demolished or is destroyed by fire on or after August 26, 2011, the sewer capacity or "sewer connection fee credit" associated with that structure will be considered valid for a period of five years from the date the structure was demolished or destroyed. 
(a)  Proof of such must be accepted by the director of public works and the building department pursuant to Title 12.16 to terminate billing. 
(b)  If a building permit is not issued utilizing the approved sewer "connection fee credit" within the five years, the credits will no longer be considered valid. 
(4)  If a structure is rebuilt on the property or contiguous property under common ownership or agreement (providing it flows into the same collection system and causes no capacity problems), the connection fee at the current rate associated with that sewer capacity will be applied. 
(5)  If the fixture units shown in the plans for the new structure to be built exceed the connection fee credit, the balance of the calculated connection fees must be paid at the current rate prior to the issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy pursuant to RMC 12.16.280. 
(6)  It is incumbent upon the owner to maintain the records to confirm the credit.

(2)  Effective April 1, 2000, in addition to a sewer connection fee based upon weighted fixture units, any new commercial/industrial sewer connection fee shall include an additional fee component for any wastes greater in strength than 20 percent of normal domestic wastes. The basis of cost for the additional connection fee charge shall be the unit cost of each cost category (flow, BOD, SS, P and N) for which a residential connection is charged as determined by the Sewer Service Commission. Each discharger covered by this section shall be required to submit a wastewater connection fee application containing the estimated maximum monthly quantities and peak daily quantities for flow, BOD, SS, P, N and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). The additional connection fee for Commercial/Industrial users will be based upon estimates furnished in the wastewater connection fee application and approved by the director. The environmental control discharge permit issued for which the connection fee was paid will contain the allowed flow and loading specific to the property from which the discharge will occur. The environmental control discharge permit issued under section 12.16.610. (Permit for industrial/commercial discharges) may contain provisions requiring the discharger to report future flows and strength. The environmental control discharge permit may limit actual discharge based upon the estimate furnished in the wastewater connection fee application. In the event flow and/or loading increases occur either incrementally or all at once after a connection fee is paid, additional connection fees will be assessed. The fee calculation shall be based upon the difference between the permitted flows and loads as contained in the original wastewater discharge permit and the maximum monthly flows and loads reported. The payment for the additional fees will become due and payable by the discharger 120 days after receipt of bill. The user may, within three years of occupancy, request a one time reevaluation of the connection fee for reimbursement of the additional connection fee. Any reimbursement shall be at the rate charged at the time the connection fee was paid.

(b)  Prepayment of sewer connection fees must be made in cash only. 
(c)  Each applicant for residential allocation shall pay his sewer connection prepayment fee, pursuant to section 12.16.290 and any amendments thereto, prior to filing each final map. No consideration for gallonage allocation shall be given to any applicant until the filing of the final map and the said prepayment of fees as required herein. 
(d)  Prepayment of sewer connection fees, pursuant to section 12.16.290 and any amendment thereto, shall be paid at the time application is made for issuance of a building permit for construction of any structure other than residential. 
(e)  The amount of prepaid fees shall be based upon the connection charges in effect at the time the prepayments are paid. 
(f)  Acceptance of prepayment of sewer connection fees shall not be deemed nor construed as a guarantee that sewage treatment capacity will be available at any point in time nor shall any person or user acquire any rights of any kind by reason of prepayment of sewer connection fees in the event that sewage treatment capacity should, at any time, be insufficient to accommodate all user applicants.

(a)  The director shall administer the allocation of sewer capacity and issuance of sewer connection permits. 
(b)  The director shall not withhold issuance of sewer connection permits indiscriminately provided sufficient capacity exists. Upon determination by the city council that the remaining sewage capacity available for allocation from the city's portion of any sewage plant is at such a level so as to endanger the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city, or is in the best interest of the city, it shall institute an allocation program for the remaining capacity. Any allocation system will divide the capacity proportionately between commercial and residential according to historical data of construction within the community prior to 1977. 
(c)  At such time as available capacity for allocation is increased by plant expansion so as to alleviate any harm to the citizens of the city, the allocation system shall be discontinued. Any action taken pursuant to the procedures established for the allocation of any remaining capacity may be appealed to the city council upon 30 days written notice of such action. 
(d)  Each application for sewer connection shall be dated and time stamped. If an allocation program is implemented, date and time will determine the order of issuance of available capacity. 
(e)  The following shall be exempt from allocation regulations and are permitted to move to the front of the allocation list. The maximum allocation shall be limited to 10,000 gallons per day per project in any given month. 
(1)  A single-family residence for the owner's use and occupancy or individuals remodeling their own single-family residence for their own use; 
(2)  Commercial application with a requirement of 500 gallons per day or less; 
(3)  Public health, safety and welfare projects; 
(4)  Affordable housing as defined by ordinance; 
(5)  Elderly and handicapped housing; 
(6)  All projects requiring consideration because of a regulatory agency's order or rule for health, welfare or safety purposes with a sewage treatment demand of six fixture units or less will be issued permits upon a sufficient showing of need; 
(7)  When it is deemed by the health department that an existing septic tank is no longer usable and is a hazard to health; 
(8)  Residential applicants with a requirement of 1,000 gallons per day, or less, per year per single family builder or developer. 
(f)  Any allocation made under subsection (e) shall be charged against the total sewage treatment capacity before any consideration is given to the allocation for residential and commercial. 
(g)  The director shall post current copies of all allocation, abeyance and waiting lists in a conspicuous place in the director's office for viewing by any person and copies shall be furnished upon request to any person.

Sec. 12.16.350. - Regulations recommendation of sewer service commission. 
The sewer service commission shall recommend to the city council regulations and policies consistent with the provisions of this chapter for the implementation of the provisions contained herein. Each prepayment of a sewer connection fee must be assigned to a specific project and shall not be transferable. 
(1)  If a specific project is unable to proceed, a return of up to 95 percent of the prepaid sewer connection fee may be made if the funds deposited have not been committed for capital projects construction. If funds have been committed, the percentage return will be 100 percent minus the percent developed by taking the amount of capital projects construction committed between the date of the prepayment and the date of the request for the return divided by the unreserved retained earnings in the capital sewer projects division of the sanitary sewer enterprise fund on the date of the request for the return. The return will never be more than 95 percent nor less than zero percent. However, if the prepayment of a sewer connection fee resulted in the city issuing a notice to the county department of health that sewage services will be provided to a subdivision, "a will-serve letter," refunds will not be made. 
(2)  Whenever a subdivision has prepaid sewer connection fees and is issued a "will-serve letter" for sewage treatment, and said subdivision subsequently reverts to acreage, a return not exceeding 95 percent of the sewer connection fee will be returned as set forth in subsection (1) above. Exception: The calculation will be made as of the date of recordation of the map of reversion or abandonment and not on the date of request for return.

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 6305, § 1, adopted August 28, 2013, amended article III in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, article III, divisions 1—4, pertained to similar subject matter. For a complete derivation, see the Code Comparative Table. 
State Law reference— Discharge and treatment of liquid waste and wastewater, NAC 444.8301 et seq. 
 
 
Sec. 12.16.500. - Applicability and objectives. 
(a)  Applicability: This article sets forth uniform requirements for all industrial users discharging to the POTW and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws including the Clean Water Act (33 United States Code, Section 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403). Any industrial user, the discharge from which directly or indirectly enters the city's POTW from areas within or without the city limits, shall be bound by this article and the definitions in article I as they now exist or may hereafter be amended. This article may be enforced against any industrial user. 
(b)  Objectives: The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly-owned treatment works (POTW) that will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge; 
(2)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system; 
(3)  To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludges from the system; 
(4)  To provide for and promote the general health, safety and welfare of the citizens residing within the city and connecting jurisdictions; 
(5)  To enable the city to comply with its NPDES permit conditions, sewage sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other applicable federal or state laws or regulations to which the POTW is subject; 
(6)  To prevent adverse impacts to worker health and safety due to the discharge of pollutants from industrial users; and 
(7)  To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance, and improvement of the POTW. 
(c)  Program cost recovery: The city may recover the costs incurred by implementing the pretreatment program established by this article and adopt charges and fees as established by the current fee resolution and any amendments thereto which establish the services charges and fees for the city, including, but not limited to the following: 
(1)  Fees for monitoring, inspection, re-inspection and surveillance activities; 
(2)  Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
(3)  Fees for permit applications; 
(4)  Fees for filing appeals and other legal expenses; 
(5)  Such other fees as the city may deem necessary to administer and enforce the requirements contained herein. 
(d)  Non-domestic industrial users: It shall be unlawful for any industrial user to discharge any domestic or non-domestic wastewater into any natural waterway, any surface drainage, or storm drain in any area under the jurisdiction of the city. In the event that an industrial user obtains a general permit from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection to discharge polluted water to a storm drain, discharge shall not occur unless the director provides written approval of such discharge. 
(Ord. No. 6305, § 1, 8-28-13)  
Sec. 12.16.510. - Regulation of industrial users from outside jurisdictions. 
The city is required to administer and enforce its pretreatment program in accordance with this chapter and its NPDES permit. In order for the city to effectively implement and enforce pretreatment standards and requirements for all industrial users discharging to the POTW and as required by 40 CFR Section 403.8(f), the city will enter into interlocal cooperative agreements (ICAs) with contributing jurisdictions. Prior agreements shall be unaffected by these requirements until such time as the city determines that modifications are necessary. 
(Ord. No. 6305, § 1, 8-28-13)  
Sec. 12.16.520. - Administration. 
Except as otherwise provided in this article, the director shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this article. Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the director may be delegated by the director to persons acting in the beneficial interest of or in the employment of the city. 
(Ord. No. 6305, § 1, 8-28-13)  
Sec. 12.16.525. - Responsibility of City of Reno. 
(a)  The city shall attempt to notify in writing any industrial user whom they have cause to believe is subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or other applicable requirements promulgated by the EPA under the provisions of Section 204(b) or 405 of the Act, or under the provisions of Sections 3001, 3004, or 4004 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Failure of the city to so notify industrial users shall not relieve said industrial users from the responsibility of complying with applicable requirements. It is the responsibility of significant industrial users to apply for and receive a permit prior to discharge, whether or not the industrial user has been identified and formally requested to do so. 
(b)  If wastewaters containing any pollutant, including excess flow, or as otherwise defined in this article, are discharged or proposed to be discharged to the POTW, the city may take any action necessary to: 
(1)  Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater; 
(2)  Require an industrial user to demonstrate that in-plant facility modifications will reduce or eliminate the discharge of such substances in conformity with this article; 
(3)  Require treatment, including storage facilities or flow equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the potential for a discharge to violate this article; 
(4)  Require the industrial user making, causing or allowing the discharge to pay any additional cost or expense incurred by the city for handling, treating, disposing or remediation costs as a result of wastes discharged to the wastewater treatment system; 
(5)  Require the industrial user to apply for and obtain a permit; 
(6)  Require timely and factual reports from the industrial user responsible for such discharge; or 
(7)  Take such other action as may be necessary to meet the objectives of this article.

These users shall install and maintain a gravity grease interceptor as directed by the city. 
(4)  Definitions. 
Best management practices (BMPs): Schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to implement the general and specific prohibitions listed in section 12.16.530 of this article. BMPs may also include, but are not limited to, treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control plant site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage. BMPs are pretreatment standards. 
Fats, oil and grease (FOG): Non-petroleum organic polar compounds derived from animal or plant sources such as fats, non-hydrocarbons, fatty acids, soaps, waxes, and oils that contain multiple carbon chain triglyceride molecules. These substances are detectable and measurable using analytical procedures established in the 40 CFR Part 136. 
Gravity grease interceptor: A plumbing appurtenance or appliance that is installed in a sanitary drainage system to intercept FOG (fats, oil and grease) from a wastewater discharge and are designed for gravity separation. Such interceptors are at least 750 gallons, include baffle(s) and a minimum of two compartments. This is an in-ground interceptor that is located outside the facility. 
(5)  FOG Variance. 
(i)  A FOG variance as to the requirements may be granted by the director for good cause. The facility has the burden of proof of demonstrating through data and other information why a FOG variance should be granted. In no case shall a variance result in violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement specified in this chapter and applicable to the discharge. The granting of any FOG variance shall be at the sole discretion of the city and may be revoked at the sole discretion of the city. The denial of a FOG variance by the director may be appealed in accordance with section 12.16.660. 
(ii)  If a FOG variance is granted, the facility shall institute best management practices and other mitigation measures as specified by the city. These BMPs may include, but not be limited to: 
a.  Allow the installation of a grease trap or continue to allow the use of an existing grease trap in lieu of installing a grease interceptor where the grease trap is shown to be effective.

(6)  Program requirements. 
(i)  General control requirements. 
a.  A gravity interceptor shall be required for all new industrial users the proper handling of liquid wastes which may be harmful to, or cause obstruction in the wastewater collection system or cause or contribute to interference or pass through. 
b.  It shall be the responsibility of the industrial user and owner of the property, business or industry or an authorized representative of the industrial user to contact the city for the purpose of obtaining a plan review. The plan review shall determine the need, size, location, and other requirements of the interceptor required to control discharges into the POTW. Written approval from the city must be obtained prior to installation of the interceptor. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. 
c.  The design and sizing of gravity interceptors shall be in accordance with requirements established by the city as set forth below. The gravity interceptor shall be designed, sized, installed, maintained and operated so as to accomplish their intended purpose of intercepting pollutants from the industrial user's wastewater and minimizing the discharge of such pollutants to the city's wastewater collection system.

j.  The industrial user must maintain interceptors at their expense and keep in efficient operating condition at all times by the regular removal of accumulated FOG. 
(ii)  Required maintenance. 
a.  Gravity interceptors shall be maintained by regularly scheduled cleaning so that they will properly operate as intended to efficiently intercept the fats, oil and grease from the facility's wastewater and prevent the discharge of said materials into the city's wastewater collection system. A gravity interceptor shall be serviced at a frequency that is specified in the industrial user's permit. Interceptors must be cleaned whenever the combined thickness of the floating greases and settled solids is greater than 25 percent of the design hydraulic depth of the interceptor. 
b.  The city may require more frequent cleaning than that prescribed in subsection (ii)(a). A variance from the requirement may be obtained if the industrial user can demonstrate less frequent cleaning is sufficient. 
c.  Maintenance of gravity interceptors shall be done by a licensed plumber or contractor normally engaged in the servicing of such plumbing fixtures. 
d.  In the event an interceptor is not properly maintained by the industrial user, owner, lessee, or other authorized representative of the facility, the city may authorize such maintenance work be performed on behalf of the industrial user. The costs of such maintenance shall be billed directly to the tenant/owner and shall become part of the charges due and owed to the city. 
e.  Biological treatment or enzyme treatment shall not be a substitute for the servicing of gravity interceptors or grease traps at the frequency required by the city. Use of enzymes or any other chemical or biological treatment or product that emulsifies or acts to emulsify FOG is prohibited. 
f.  The industrial user must document each pump-out with a waste manifest or trip ticket which must be provided to the city as required and kept by the industrial user on site for at least three years. 
g.  The industrial user must take reasonable steps to assure that all waste is properly disposed of at a facility in accordance with federal, state and local regulations (i.e. through a certification by the hauler included on the waste manifest or trip ticket for each load).

(Ord. No. 6305, § 1, 8-28-13)  
Sec. 12.16.575. - Sample collection and analytical methods. 
(a)  Sample collection. Compliance determinations with respect to the prohibitions and limitations established in this article may be made on the basis of either grab or composite samples of wastewater as specified by the city. Such samples shall be taken at a point or points which the city determines to be suitable for obtaining a representative sample of the discharge. Composite samples may be taken over a 24-hour period, or over a shorter time span, as determined by the city to meet specific circumstances. 
(b)  Sample type. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, and based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subparagraphs (2) and (3) below, the industrial user must collect representative wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is required by the city. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the permitted discharge. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composited samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous local limits, including pH. 
(3)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in division 4 and consistent with 40 CFR Part 136, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical representative sampling data do not exist. Where historical data are available, the city may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by division 4, the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(c)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analysis, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application, report, permit or other analyses required under this article shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the city or other parties approved by the EPA. 
(d)  Records shall include for all samples: 
(1)  The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; 
(2)  The date(s) analyses were performed; 
(3)  Who performed the analyses; 
(4)  The analytical techniques/methods used, including method detection limits and QA/QC sample results; 
(5)  Calibration and maintenance records; 
(6)  All chain-of-custody records; and 
(7)  The results of such analyses.

Upon written notice from the city of the requirement for pretreatment of discharge, the industrial user shall have ten working days to reply to the director as to a plan of compliance and shall be in compliance within 90 days unless a time extension is otherwise granted by the city. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the director for review and shall be acceptable before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be approved by the director. 
(b)  Wastewater discharge control: The city may require an industrial user to restrict discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specified sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and demonstrate the industrial user's compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(c)  Flow equalization: The city may require any industrial user discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An industrial discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(Ord. No. 6305, § 1, 8-28-13)  
Sec. 12.16.605. - Monitoring equipment required. 
(a)  The director may require the industrial user to install, at the industrial user's expense, suitable monitoring facilities or equipment that allows for the representative sampling and accurate observation of wastewater discharges. Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications. Monitoring equipment and structures shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all times to city personnel. The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the industrial user's premises outside of the building unless otherwise approved by the city. If the monitoring structure is located within the secured perimeter of the industrial user, there shall be accommodations to allow safe and immediate access for city personnel. This may include immediate access through security gates or installation of a separate gate secured with a city lock. When installation of monitoring facilities at a location within the industrial user's facility would be impractical, the city may allow such facility to be constructed in the public street or easement area, with the approval of the agency having jurisdiction over such street or easement, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(b)  When more than one industrial user can discharge into a common service line, the director may require installation of a separate monitoring facility and equipment for each industrial user. Also when, in the judgment of the director, there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different operations of a single industrial user the director may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for differing discharge. 
(c)  Monitoring facilities shall be operated and maintained at the industrial user's expense. 
(d)  Flow, pH and LEL meters: If the director determines that an industrial user needs to measure and report wastewater flow, discharge process wastewaters necessitating continuous pH measurement or discharge wastewater that may contain flammable substances may be required to install and maintain, at the industrial user's expense, approved meters, structures and equipment. 
(e)  Unless approved by the director in writing, no industrial user shall cover any manhole, sewer cleanout, or other openings in the wastewater collection system with earth, paving, or otherwise render it inaccessible. 
(f)  When, in the judgment of the city, an existing user requires a monitoring facility, the user will be so notified in writing. Construction must be completed within 90 days following written notification unless a time extension is otherwise granted by the city. 
(Ord. No. 6305, § 1, 8-28-13)  
 
Sec. 12.16.610. - Permit for industrial users. 
(a)  Industrial users are categorized into one of the five classes. 
(b)  Upon finding by the city that an industrial user meeting the criteria in subsection (b) of this definition has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may at any time, on its own initiative or in response to a petition received from an industrial user, and in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.8(f)(2), determine that such industrial user is not a significant industrial user. 
(1)  Class I: Those industrial users with sanitary facilities only or which have other activities that would not pose a reasonable potential to discharge pollutants of concern to the city. These industrial users may be required to periodically submit an industrial waste survey. If the industrial user believes that it performs or will perform any activities resulting in reclassification as a Class II, III, IV or V facility, it shall report this change to the director. These industrial users are not required to obtain wastewater discharge permits. 
(2)  Class II: Industrial users, not meeting the definition of significant industrial user, that discharge wastewater or have the reasonable potential to discharge pollutants of concern to the city or otherwise have operations that the city believes could result in the discharge of pollutants. These industrial users shall receive a permit and/or reporting requirements and may be required by the city to meet specific discharge limits and/or specific best management practices. 
(3)  Class III: Industrial users meeting the definition of significant industrial user under section 12.16.010 and which are not categorical industrial users. 
(4)  Class IV: Industrial users that perform categorical processes listed in 40 CFR Chapter I, subchapter N, Parts 405-471 with categorical discharge standards, but do not discharge or have the potential to discharge wastewater to the POTW from such categorical processes. Class IV industrial users may discharge domestic sewage and industrial wastewater that is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and complies with any other applicable pretreatment requirements. 
(5)  Class V: Industrial users meeting the definition of "significant industrial user" and "categorical industrial user" as defined in section 12.16.010 and which discharge non-domestic waste to the POTW.

Sec. 12.16.615. - Permits required. 
(a)  Permits required. All Class III, IV and V industrial users shall not discharge to the POTW without an unexpired wastewater discharge permit issued by the city. A separate permit may be required for each industrial user, building or complex of buildings. All other industrial users that are determined to be Class II industrial users shall be notified by the city with applicable permitting and/or reporting requirements. 
(b)  New industrial users: Applying for a wastewater discharge permit. All Class III, IV and V industrial users shall apply for and obtain a wastewater discharge permit prior to discharging to the POTW. The industrial user shall file a permit application on forms provided by the city containing the information specified in subsection 12.16.620(b). The completed application for the wastewater discharge permit must be filed at least 90 days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence. 
(c)  Existing industrial users: Applying for a wastewater discharge permit re-issuance. A Class III, IV and V industrial user with an expiring wastewater discharge permit shall apply for a new permit by submitting a complete permit application at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the industrial user's existing wastewater discharge permit. The industrial user shall file a permit application on forms provided by the city containing the information specified in subsection 12.16.620(b). An industrial user with an existing permit that has filed a complete and timely application may continue to discharge as approved in writing by the city through an administrative extension of the existing permit if the delay in permit issuance is not due to any act or failure to act on the industrial user's part. 
(d)  Enforceability. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit, failure to apply for a permit as required, or discharging without a required permit shall be deemed a violation of this article and subjects the industrial user to enforcement by the city. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all state and federal pretreatment standards or requirements.

Sec. 12.16.780. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(a)  The industrial user shall notify the city, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). 
(b)  If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. 
(c)  All notifications must take place within 180 days of the effective date of this rule. Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date of this rule shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under section 12.16.770. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 12.16.680, 12.16.700 and 12.16.710. 
(d)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR Sections 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR Sections 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(e)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the city, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(f)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.

When the city finds that an industrial user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may serve upon the industrial user a written notice of violation. Within ten business days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction of prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the industrial user to the city. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the industrial user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Administrative citation. When the city finds that an industrial user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may serve upon the industrial user an administrative citation as allowed for in chapter 1.05.

If the industrial user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the industrial user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the industrial user. 
(d)  Consent agreement. The city may enter into a consent agreement, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any industrial user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific actions to be taken by the industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. A consent agreement may include penalties (assessed and stipulated), supplemental environmental projects, or other conditions and requirements as agreed to by the city and the industrial user. 
(e)  Show cause hearing.   
(1)  The city may order any industrial user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before the city why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the industrial user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the city regarding the violation, the reasons why the proposed action is to be taken, and directing the industrial user to show cause before the city why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or be sent by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten calendar days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. The hearing will generally follow the procedures established at subsection 12.16.660(c). 
(f)  Cease and desist order.   
(1)  When the director finds that an industrial user is violating this division, a permit, any order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the industrial user's past compliance history indicates that violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the industrial user to: 
(i)  Immediately comply with all requirements; 
(ii)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
(2)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the industrial user. 
(g)  Suspension of service.   
(1)  Endangerment to health or welfare of the community: The city, through other than a formal notice to the affected industrial user, may immediately and effectively halt or prevent any discharge of pollutants into any natural waterway, surface drainage within the city, any area under jurisdiction of the city, the POTW of the city or any wastewater system tributary thereto, by any means available to them, including physical disconnection from the wastewater system, whenever it reasonably appears that such discharge presents an imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of the community. 
(2)  Endangerment to environment or treatment works: The city, after written notice to the discharger may halt or prevent any discharge of pollutants into any natural waterway, surface drainage within the city, any area under jurisdiction of the city, the POTW, wastewater system tributary thereto, by any means available to them, including physical disconnection from the wastewater system, whenever such discharge presents or may present an endangerment to the environment or threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW. 
(3)  Any person notified by the city of a suspension or revocation of the wastewater treatment service and/or a permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to individuals or the environment. The city may reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge. 
(4)  A detailed written statement submitted by the industrial user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measure taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be provided to the city within ten business days of the date of occurrence. Suspension of service shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the industrial user. 
(Ord. No. 6305, § 1, 8-28-13)  
Sec. 12.16.811. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. When the city finds that an industrial user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the a permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of an industrial user. The city may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the industrial user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against an industrial user. 
(b)  Civil penalties.   
(1)  An industrial user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement may be subject to the imposition of a court imposed civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 per day per violation. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of violation. 
(2)  The city may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
(3)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against an industrial user. 
(c)  Civil administrative fine pass through. In the event that an industrial user discharges such pollutants which cause the city to violate any condition of its wastewater discharge permit and the city is fined by the EPA or the state for such violation, then such industrial user shall be fully liable for the total amount of the fine assessed against the city by the EPA and/or the state. 
(d)  Criminal prosecution.   
(1)  The city may refer violations that warrant criminal prosecution to the U.S. Attorney General's Office, State Attorney General, EPA Criminal Investigation Division or other appropriate agency. This referral shall not preclude the city from taking a parallel administrative or civil enforcement action.

Sec. 12.16.1900. - Permit for industrial/commercial storm water discharges. 
(a)  Commercial/industrial storm water discharges will be categorized into one of the four classes described below: 
(1)  Class I: Those commercial establishments with storm water facilities only, who could not discharge any wastes greater in strength than normal storm water runoff and do not have potentially hazardous materials used or stored on their property. These dischargers may require a cursory inspection to verify specific operations within these facilities upon start up or relocation of the business. 
(2)  Class II: Those commercial/industrial establishments with storm water collection facilities, which may discharge storm water of a strength greater than that normally discharged from domestic dwelling. These establishments will have a minimal potential of discharging toxic materials to the system, and may have a requirement to pretreat storm water in a regulated manner. Also, those commercial/industrial establishments which have small amounts of toxic materials or waste on hand but which present only a slight hazard of being discharged to the system. These establishments will normally be inspected and have records verified once per year. 
(3)  Class III: Those commercial/industrial establishments whose storm water may contain materials which may be considered toxic, but which are not treatable or which could potentially cause a hazard to the system. Those establishments which store and/or repackage or generate large amounts of hazardous (toxic) materials or waste which are not normally discharged to the system but which could enter the system through stormwater collection facilities and thus present a potential hazard to the system. Those businesses that have multiple pretreatment systems and multiple operations at one facility that require more time consuming and complex inspections. These businesses will normally be inspected and have records verified once per year but may require additional inspections or records verification. 
(4)  Class IV: Those industrial/commercial dischargers which are subject to federal storm water regulations and are classified as categorical industries or significant industrial dischargers that discharge storm water that may contain toxic or hazardous materials and the city monitors this discharge to assure it meets discharge requirements. These establishments are inspected 4 times a year with sampling during storm water events. 
(b)  Dischargers will be classified based upon this information. All industrial commercial dischargers who are not classified as Class I dischargers must obtain a storm water discharge permit from the public works director. It is unlawful for these industrial/commercial users to discharge to the system without such a permit.

CHAPTER 14.30. - ENERGY AND WATER EFFICIENCY PROGRAM 
 
Sec. 14.30.001. - Findings. 
(a)  On September 9, 2015, The City of Reno committed to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 28 percent by 2025 and 40 percent by 2030 to combat climate change and move to a low emission, resilient society through its commitment to the Global Covenant of Mayors on Energy and Climate. Furthermore, the City of Reno committed to report emissions reductions regularly to track progress toward its emissions reduction targets. 
(b)  The City of Reno 2014 community-wide greenhouse gas emissions inventory reports that buildings are the single largest users of energy and generate 66 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. 
(c)  Collecting, reporting, and sharing building energy data on a regular basis allows municipal officials and building owners to understand the energy performance of buildings relative to similar buildings nationwide, and equipped with this information are able to make smarter, more cost-effective operational and capital investment decisions, reward efficiency, and drive widespread, continuous improvement. 
(d)  The City of Reno, city council, approved the use of building energy benchmarking - a process of measuring building energy use, tracking use over time, and comparing performance to similar buildings - to promote public health, safety, and welfare by making available good, actionable information on building energy use to help identify opportunities to reduce energy use, generate cost savings, and reduce climate pollution. 
(e)  The City of Reno will use the data collected to inform development of programs to expand or enhance workforce development, incentives, education and training, and technical resources that remove barriers to the energy efficiency market, create jobs, conserve energy and water, and lower building operational costs. 
(f)  The City of Reno, city council, will establish a procedure and guideline to conduct such building energy benchmarking.

Sec. 14.30.002. - Purpose and intent. 
This chapter establishes the energy and water efficiency program that requires covered properties to benchmark energy and water performance, and make such performance information available to raise awareness and drive action. Further, it requires buildings that do not meet specific standards to perform an action or actions to increase performance. The benchmarking requirement supports the City of Reno's goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in buildings 28 percent by 2025. Annual benchmarking, reporting and disclosure of building performance are foundational elements of removing market barriers for energy efficiency. This will allow the city to track energy and water use and progress toward reduction goals to inform development of new programs and resources needed to support each market sector.

CHAPTER 18.08 - ZONING 
[1] 
OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER 
Chapter 18.08 
(Zoning) contains regulations that specify the type of land uses allowed in Reno, where a specific use may be established in the city, what type of city review is necessary prior to the use's establishment, and what-if any-regulations specific to a particular type of use are applicable. Chapter 18.08 is organized into five articles; each is summarized below. 
Article I establishes the base and overlay zoning districts through the adoption of the official zoning map, and states the specific intent or purpose of each district. Zoning districts provide a citywide framework for regulating the type, location, and intensity of land uses allowed in Reno. Article I also provides direction for the zoning of newly annexed land and rules for interpreting the zoning map. 
Article II contains the Summary Land Use Tables, which show all uses allowed in Reno and indicates in which zoning district a use is permitted. The tables also indicate whether a specific use must have an approved special use permit or site plan review approval from the city prior to its establishment, and whether establishment of the use is subject to any use-specific regulations. Following the land use tables, sections present the additional use-specific regulations referenced in the tables, as well as general and specific regulations for accessory and temporary uses. In addition to compliance with any use-specific regulations stated in this article, all uses are also subject to compliance with Title 18's general development and design standards, including but not limited to Chapter 18.12 (General Development and Design Standards). 
Article III presents each base zoning district, and includes any use or development standards special or specific to a particular zoning district. The article presents first the residential base zoning districts (e.g., SF4 or MF14 Districts), then the nonresidential and mixed use base zoning districts (e.g., PO or CB Districts), and finally special purpose base zoning districts such as the PUD, SPD, and the Greenfield Districts. Similarly, Article IV presents the district-specific standards for the overlay zoning districts in the city. An "overlay" district is mapped on top of a base zoning district, and its use and development standards apply in addition to the base zoning district's requirements. If there is a conflict between an overlay zoning provision and a base zoning district provision, the overlay provision takes precedence except where specifically noted. In Reno, overlay zoning districts have been established for more general purposes, such as the Historic/Landmark General Overlay District intended to preserve historic resources and landmarks in all parts of the city, or for a more specific planning purpose often tied to a specific character or neighborhood in Reno, such as the West University Neighborhood Planning Area Overlay District. 
Article V concludes the chapter with provisions governing nonconformities, which are uses, lots, and signs that were legally established under previous zoning and land use rules, but which do not comply with current rules established in this chapter and other provisions of Title 18. Nonconformities may continue, but are limited regarding, among other things, allowable expansions, restoration after damage or destruction, and reestablishment after abandonment.

This district provides for small lot and clustered single-family subdivisions and establishes specific design requirements to reduce the visual and functional problems created by smaller lot sizes. This district is considered appropriate on infill sites and in areas of minimal slope. In areas of significant slope (15 percent or more), its use is appropriate only to the extent that it results in the preservation of steep or difficult to develop land. 
(8)  MF14 Multi-Family.   
a.  Purpose. This district provides for low-density multi-family residential developments. This type of multi-residential zoning is considered to be the one that is most appropriate adjacent to single-family residences. 
(9)  MF21 Multi-Family.   
a.  Purpose. This district provides for areas of residential use where the predominant type of housing is low-rise multi-family. It is further the intent of this district to ensure that amenities are provided within developments to offset the impacts of increased residential densities. This district is considered appropriate adjacent to the MF14 Zoning District and predominantly commercial areas. 
(10)  MF30 Multi-Family.   
a.  Purpose. This district provides for areas of residential and limited nonresidential use where the predominant type of housing is low-rise multi-family. It is further the intent of this district to assure that necessary amenities are provided within developments to offset the impacts of increased residential densities. 
(c)  Nonresidential and Mixed Use Base Zoning Districts.   
(1)  MU Mixed Use District.   
a.  Purpose. This district promotes high intensity mixed use development in designated regional centers and transit-oriented development ("TOD") corridors. MU zoning is permitted only where there is a regional center or TOD corridor plan adopted as part of the City of Reno Master Plan. 
b.  District-specific standards. See Section 18.08.301. 
(2)  OS Open Space District.   
a.  Purpose. This district preserves areas as open space and may also be applied to areas reserved for drainage facilities and utilities.

a.  Purpose. This district provides for public facilities and public service uses which may be in private ownership, including utility uses, parks and recreation areas and institutions. 
(6)  NC Neighborhood Commercial.   
a.  Purpose. This district provides for commercial and service enterprises that are customarily associated with residential development and allows for uses that are frequented for personal goods or services resulting in a reduction in the number and length of vehicle trips. This district is not appropriate for businesses that are based on a community-wide or regional market. 
b.  District-specific standards. See Section 18.08.301. 
(7)  AC Arterial Commercial.   
a.  Purpose. This district provides for commercial and service enterprises that generate large volumes of automobile traffic and are dependent upon direct or indirect access to major arterials. 
(8)  CC Community Commercial.   
a.  Purpose. This district provides for general commercial and service enterprises for the community at large. 
(9)  HC Hotel Casino.   
a.  Purpose.

(10)  I Industrial.   
a.  Purpose. This district provides for intensive activities and land uses that have the most potential for impacting adjacent land uses and infrastructure (e.g., heavy industrial). This zoning should be located in areas with access to air, roadway, and/or railway transportation systems. 
(11)  IC Industrial Commercial.   
a.  Purpose. This district provides for a mix of industrial and small-scale commercial land uses. This type of zoning should be separated from residential development by natural or manmade buffers such as major drainage ways and arterial roadways. 
b.  District-specific standards. See Section 18.08.301. 
(12)  IB Industrial Business.   
a.  Purpose. This district provides for research and development and production facilities. It is primarily intended for developing areas. This type of zoning should be separated from residential development by natural and manmade buffers such as major drainage ways and arterial roadways. 
(d)  Special Purpose Base Zoning Districts.   
(1)  General. A special purpose zoning district is a base zoning district that has unique characteristics because of a specialized use that requires special zoning regulations to provide for the use. 
Special purpose districts may designate special regulations regarding land uses, buildings and structures, building height, building site areas, setback requirements, and any other item regulated in Title 18. 
(2)  PUD Planned Unit Development Special Purpose District.   
a.  Purpose. This district encourages flexibility in the development of land to promote the most appropriate and compatible uses; improves the design, character, and quality of new development; facilitates the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities; and preserves the natural and scenic features in the community. More specifically, the purpose of the Planned Unit Development District is: 
1.  To encourage flexibility in the development of land in Reno; 
2.  To promote its most appropriate and compatible use; 
3.  To improve the design, character, and quality of new development; 
4.  To facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities; and 
5.  To preserve the natural and scenic features of open areas in the community. 
b.  District-specific standards. See Section 18.08.302. 
(3)  SPD Specific Plan District.   
a.  Purpose. The City of Reno recognizes existing SPD designations, however, no longer accepts applications for this zoning designation. The following purpose statement remains for reference: 
The purpose of this district is to accommodate projects or plans where the design and configuration of the uses are so arranged as to constitute a single functionally integrated entity. In such projects the use of land within a component, and among the various components, if there is more than one component, must be designed to be compatible and complementary. In this district the location, use and physical characteristics of structures, improvements, and open space must all work together in furthering the stated purpose of the design of the project or plan. 
In order to achieve optimal functional integration in such projects or plans, the city recognizes that it may be desirable to regulate and restrict on a project or plan specific basis the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures, or land. Further, the city recognizes that the purpose of this district may be furthered by permitting a diversity of land uses not found in other zoning districts. In light of the multitude of land uses which may be permitted in this district, and the need to ensure that such uses are internally compatible and both complementary and compatible with surrounding and nearby existing and/or planned uses of land, it is the express intent of the city to subject requests for changes in zoning to the Specific Plan District to a heightened level of scrutiny during the review process and, should a request be approved, to strictly limit the possibilities of change in the use or arrangement of land, structures, and open space. 
(4)  UT5 Unincorporated-5 acre.   
a.  Purpose. This district converts properties that Washoe County has planned for large lot residential development to a city zoning district without modifying the planned density. Other uses may include agriculture, energy production and outdoor recreation. 
b.  District-specific standards. See Section 18.08.302. 
(5)  UT10 Unincorporated-10 acre.   
a.  Purpose. This district converts properties that Washoe County has planned for large lot residential development to a city zoning district without modifying the planned density. Other uses may include agriculture, energy production and outdoor recreation. 
b.  District-specific standards. See Section 18.08.302. 
(6)  UT40 Unincorporated-40 acre.   
a.  Purpose. This district converts properties that Washoe County has planned for large lot residential development to a city zoning district without modifying the planned density. Other uses may include agriculture, energy production and outdoor recreation. 
b.  District-specific standards. See Section 18.08.302. 
(e)  Overlay Zoning Districts-General Purpose and Establishment.   
(1)  General purpose. An overlay district, whether a general or a planning area overlay district, is a zoning district that is superimposed on an underlying base zoning district, thus establishing a layer of additional regulations that restrict, prohibit, or add to the base zoning regulations set forth in this title. 
(2)  Establishment of general and planning area overlay zoning districts. Pursuant to authority granted by NRS 278.250, the city council hereby establishes two types of overlay zoning districts: general and planning area overlay districts. General overlay districts are intended to address unique issues, opportunities, and challenges associated with a specific type of land use or specific type of geologic feature that may be found or established in many different parts of the city. Planning area overlay districts are intended to address unique land use issues, opportunities, and challenges associated with a specific geographic part or portion of the city, and for which the city has adopted or applied specific area land use plans or policies. Accordingly, the general and planning area overlay districts applicable in the city are:

(1)  Boundaries are intended to parallel street lines or to follow lot or property lines as they exist at the time of passage of this chapter or amendments hereto, unless specifically shown otherwise. 
(2)  Where a boundary follows a public street or alley, the centerline of the street shall be the boundary. If the street moves, the zoning boundary moves accordingly. 
(3)  In the event of further uncertainty, the administrator shall determine the boundary location. 
(4)  The administrator may make minor adjustments to the zoning district boundaries based on a final subdivision design provided a finding is made that such adjustment is not contrary to the original project approval and is in compliance with this title. 
(b)  Errors and Omissions.   
(1)  If a previously approved map amendment was not changed by error or oversight, the administrator shall make any changes necessary to comply with the approved map amendment. 
(2)  The administrator may make minor adjustments to district boundaries of a zoning map amendment case provided: 
a.  The minor modification is made based on the filing of a final map which shows minor discrepancies with the legal description provided with the initial application for a zoning change; 
b.  The intent of the original project is met; and 
c.  The change does not have any effect on the character of the proposed zoning map amendment.

(1)  The express enumeration in this chapter of a particular class of building or use in any district shall be determined a prohibition of such building or use in all other districts unless so specified. 
(2)  Uses not specifically included in any zoning district and not specifically excluded therefrom by this chapter may be included in that district, as determined by the administrator, if such uses are similar to and not more obnoxious than the uses specifically included, or if such uses are accessory to uses that are specifically included. 
(c)  Lots Divided into Separate Ownership. Where a lot is divided into separate ownerships and the area of either portion is such that the number and location of buildings thereon no longer conforms to the lot area requirements of the particular district, then in the determination of the permissive number and location of buildings of either portion, both parts shall be considered as one parcel only.

ARTICLE II: - PERMITTED USES AND USE REGULATIONS 

Section 18.08.201. - Permitted Uses by Base Zone District. 
(a)  Interpretation of Summary Land Use Tables. Buildings, structures, and land shall be used only in accordance with the uses permitted in the following Summary Land Use Tables, subject to all other applicable requirements of this chapter and title. 
(1)  Organization of Uses and Interpretation of Table Cell Entries. The Summary Land Use Tables in the following subsections set forth the principal, accessory, and temporary uses of land, buildings, and structures allowed in each of the base zone districts in the city, except as noted in subsection (b) below for the special purpose zoning districts. Specific uses are organized alphabetically under the following seven broad use categories: 
a.  Residential; 
b.  Commercial Sales and Services; 
c.  Recreation, Entertainment, and Amusement; 
d.  Lodging; 
e.  Institutional, Public, and Community Service; 
f.  Industrial, Manufacturing, Wholesale, Distribution, and Transportation; and 
g.  Other. 
The entry in each table cell indicates whether the use may be established in the particular zone district and what type of review procedure is applicable prior to establishment of the use. A blank square or cell shall mean that the use is not allowed in that zoning district as a principal, accessory, or temporary use. An entry in the cell indicates the use is allowed in the zoning district subject to compliance with all applicable regulations and with the specific type of review procedure, as indicated by one of the following abbreviations: 
  
TABLE 18.08-3: SUMMARY LAND USE TABLE CELL ENTRIESSUMMARY LAND USE
TABLE CELL ENTRYMEANING OF SUMMARY LAND USE TABLE CELL ENTRY "P" • The use is permitted as a principal use in the zoning district by right, and is not subject to a discretionary review procedure. • The use shall comply with all applicable use-specific regulations referenced in the "additional regulations" column of the summary use table, and with all general development and design standards applicable to such use and/or zone district as set forth in this chapter and title. "SUP" • The use is permitted in that zoning district only after first obtaining a special use permit (SUP) according to the procedures and criteria set forth in Section 18.06.405. • The use shall comply with all applicable use-specific regulations referenced in the "additional regulations" column of the summary use table, and with all general development and design standards applicable to such use and/or zone district as set forth in this chapter and title. • Any specific regulations referenced in the summary use tables are the minimum conditions for approval of a special use permit for the subject use. Additional conditions may also be required during the public hearing process to ensure compatibility of that use in relation to surrounding uses and the pattern of development, and as needed to make the findings in Section 18.06.405. • Uses subject to special use permits that do not have additional regulations referenced in the summary use tables may have conditions placed on the proposed use during the public hearing process to ensure compatibility of the use in relation to surrounding uses and the pattern of development, and as needed to make the findings in Section 18.06.405. "SPR" • The use is permitted in the zoning district only after first obtaining administrative approval of a site plan review as set forth in Section 18.06.407. • The use shall comply with all applicable use-specific regulations referenced in the "additional regulations" column of the summary use table, and with all general development and design standards applicable to such use and/or zone district as set forth in this chapter and title. "A" • The use is permitted as an accessory use to a primary use allowed in the zoning district. • Establishment of the specific accessory use listed in the table does not necessarily exclude other land uses that are generally considered accessory to the primary use. • The accessory use shall comply with all applicable use-specific regulations referenced in the "additional regulations" column of the summary use table, with the accessory use and structure standards stated in Section 18.08.203 of this chapter, and with all general development and design standards applicable to such accessory use and/or zone district as set forth in this chapter and title. Blank Cell • The use is prohibited in the zoning district.  
(2)  Additional regulations and references.   
a.  General. All allowed uses, whether permitted by-right, conditionally, or by special use permit or site plan review, are subject to all applicable zoning, development, and design standards in this chapter and title. 
b.  Base zoning district regulations. Land uses shown in the Summary Land Use Tables may be subject to specific regulations and limitations established in the applicable base zoning district. District-specific use and development regulations are found in Article III (District-Specific Standards - Base Zoning Districts) and Article IV (District-Specific Standards - Overlay Zoning Districts). 
c.  Overlay zoning district regulations. Land uses shown in the Summary Land Use Tables as allowed in a particular base zoning district may be limited by application of an overlay zoning district. Applicants and property owners should refer the city's official Zoning Maps and to Article IV (District-Specific Standards - Overlay Zoning Districts) below, for applicable overlay zoning provisions. 
d.  Use-specific regulations. Allowed uses may also be subject to specific use regulations, as referenced in the "Additional Regulations" column of the Summary Land Use Tables. These additional use-specific regulations are found in Sections 18.08.202, 18.08.203, and 18.08.204 immediately following the use tables, and apply in all zoning districts unless otherwise expressly stated. 
(3)  Additional thresholds for special use permit review.   
a.  Additional special use permit review thresholds. In addition to the establishment of "special use permit" uses in certain zoning districts as indicated by a "SUP" entry in the Summary Land Use Tables, approval of a special use permit is required for certain categories of uses and development activity, regardless of zoning district, as specified in the applicability and exemption provisions of Section 18.06.405 (Special Use Permit). For example, development of commercial uses in a nonresidential zoning district may trigger special use permit review if located adjacent to residentially zoned property. 
(4)  Similar and prohibited uses.   
a.  The uses permitted in this section are classified on the basis of common operational characteristics and land use compatibility.

(b)  Commercial Sales and Service Use Regulations.   
(1)  Adult business.   
a.  Purpose; findings and rationale.   
1.  The purpose of these adult business regulations is to prevent crime, protect the city tourist and retail trade, maintain property values, and preserve the quality of the city's neighborhoods, commercial districts and urban life, and permit reasonable alternative avenues of communication to prevent the proliferation of illegal sex-related businesses. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this code to restrict or deny access by adults to adult businesses protected by the First Amendment; nor is it to suppress any speech activities protected by the First Amendment. Instead, the intent is to enact a content-neutral ordinance which addresses the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses. 
The predominant concern of these regulations is the limitation and prevention of the adverse secondary effects of the operation of adult businesses which manifest through exposure of minors to adult business activities and materials (including in the form of exterior signage), distraction to motorists, harm to neighboring properties, businesses and tourism, spread of disease, commission of crime and exacerbation of these effects by the clustering of adult businesses and allowance and use of alcohol on the premises of adult businesses. 
2.  The provisions of these regulations have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communication, including adult business-related materials or performances. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of these regulations to restrict or deny access by adults to adult business-related communication protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors, exhibitors, and performers of adult business-related communication to their intended market. Likewise, the City seeks to assure adequate locations within the City of Reno for the conduct of adult businesses, and that regulations governing adult businesses are content neutral reasonable time, place and manner regulations furthering the purpose of these regulations. 
3.  Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of the operation of adult businesses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the City Council, including findings and interpretations incorporated in multiple court cases, and including multiple studies and reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around adult businesses 1 , the City Council finds: 
i.  Adult businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, exposure of minors to adult business activities and materials (including in the form of exterior signage), exposure of minors to alcohol and adverse secondary effects associated with adult businesses, decrease in nearby property value in both commercial and residential areas, economic vitality of nearby businesses, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of and exacerbating adverse secondary effects. 
ii.  Adult businesses should be separated by suitable zoning location and reasonably spaced from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses. 
iii.  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the City has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the City's rationale for this section of code, exists independent of any comparative analysis between adult businesses and non-adult businesses. In addition, the City's interest in regulating adult businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future adult businesses that may locate in the city. The City finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this section of code are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

Section 18.08.203. - Standards for Accessory Uses and Structures. 
(a)  General Provisions and Standards.   
(1)  Accessory uses permitted. The Summary Land Use Tables in Section 18.08.201 of this chapter includes accessory uses and shows in which zoning district a specific accessory use is permitted and the applicability of any additional regulations for such accessory use. If an accessory use is not listed in the Summary Land Use Table, the administrator may allow the accessory use if he finds that such use satisfies the definition of "accessory use" in Section 18.24.203 and that the unlisted use is customarily incidental to the principal use or structure, and is located on the same lot or tract of land as the principal use or structure. In making such determination, the administrator shall apply the criteria for unlisted uses stated in Section 18.08.201(a) to the extent applicable. 
(2)  Accessory structures permitted. An accessory structure that is customarily incidental to the principal use or structure, and is located on the same lot or tract of land as the principal use or structure, shall be permitted, subject to the regulations of this Section 18.08.203. The administrator shall have the authority to determine whether a proposed accessory structure is "accessory" consistent with this section, the definition of "accessory structure" in Section 18.24.203, and the purpose and intent of the subject zoning district. 
(3)  Applicable regulations. All accessory uses, structures, and activities shall be subject to the general, dimensional, operational, and use-specific regulations stated in this Section 18.08.203 in addition to the same regulations that apply to the principal use in the subject zoning district. In case of any conflict between the accessory use/structure standards in this Section 18.08.203 and any other requirement of Title 18, the standards of this section shall apply. 
(b)  Accessory Buildings and Structures in Residential Zoning Districts. The standards in this subsection shall apply to all accessory buildings and structures in the residential zoning districts except caretaker quarters, unless otherwise specifically stated. Caretaker quarters are regulated by the standards in Section 18.08.203(e). 
(1)  Accessory building requires principal building. No private garages or other accessory buildings or structures may be constructed or located in any residential zoning district without an approved principal building. 
(2)  Accessory buildings on lots larger than the required minimum size. Accessory building standards for lots larger than the required minimum size may be utilized if the subject lot complies with minimum lot size and dimensions for the larger lot zoning district. For example, the LLR.5 zoning district regulations may be utilized for a SF15 zoned half-acre size parcel. 
(3)  Number of permitted detached accessory structures on a single residential lot. Limits on the number of detached accessory structures allowed on a single lot in a residential zoning district are shown in Table 18.08-9 below. These limits shall apply only to detached accessory structures with a gross floor area of 200 square feet or larger. The maximum limits shown here may not be possible to achieve in all circumstances; each case will depend on the applicability of other bulk and dimensional standards (e.g., required setbacks or maximum building coverage) or other site development standards (e.g., hillside protection).

(4)  Design of detached accessory buildings. A detached accessory building in a residential zoning district that contains 200 square feet or more of gross floor area shall be architecturally compatible with the existing or proposed principal residential building. Architectural compatibility must be achieved by including two of the following three elements in the accessory building design: 
a.  The exterior finish is constructed with materials compatible with the principal building materials. The new materials shall be either identical or similar to the principal building materials. For example, details of synthetic siding should match that of traditional wood siding. 
b.  Contemporary interpretations of architectural features such as trim, fenestration, window frames, dormers, columns, gables, decorative wood or metal work found on the existing principal building are used. 
c.  The roof pitch is the same as that of the most predominant roof plane of the principal building. 
(5)  Applicability to existing accessory structures.   
a.  Nonconforming accessory structures that do not meet the minimum setback standards stated in Section 18.08.203(c) below may be replaced with a new structure of gross floor area not to exceed 125% of the structure's gross floor area. The new structure's building footprint is to correspond to that of the replaced structure's footprint with the exception that up to 25% of the enlarged area may exceed the existing structure's footprint. 
b.  Nonconforming accessory structures that do not meet the minimum setback standards contained in Section 18.08.203(c) below may be enlarged by 25% of gross floor area. 
(c)  Lot, Bulk and Dimensional Standards for Accessory Structures and Buildings-Residential Zoning Districts. All accessory structures and buildings in the residential zoning districts shall comply with the lot, bulk and dimensional standards shown in Tables 18.08-9A and 18.08-9B except when Section 18.08.203(e) states a more specific bulk or dimensional standard for a specific type of accessory structure. In case of conflict between a standard stated in Table 18.08-9A or -9B and a specific standard stated in Section 18.08.203(e), the use-specific standard in Section 18.08.203(e) shall apply.

(a)  District-Specific Site Compatibility and Adjacency Standards.   
(1)  Applicability and exemptions. This subsection (b)'s compatibility and adjacency standards shall apply as follows: 
a.  New development proposed in cooperative planning areas within 500 feet of the existing built environment, or within 500 feet of platted lots shall be subject to the compatibility and adjacency standards stated in both subsections (b)(3) and in (b)(4). 
b.  All new development that does not fall into the category described in subsection (2)a. above shall be subject to the compatibility and adjacency standards stated in subsection (b)(4). 
c.  The compatibility and adjacency standards stated in subsections (b)(3) and in (b)(4) shall not apply where the property is within an adopted center or corridor plan that includes adjacency standards and was prepared in accordance with the cooperative planning process. 
d.  Wherever, in the opinion of the administrator, a natural barrier (e.g., ridgeline, river, open space, or natural terrain change) buffers the existing built environment or platted lots from the proposed new development, these compatibility and adjacency standards shall not apply. 
(2)  Site compatibility and adjacency standards for development within 500 feet of existing built environment or platted lots.   
a.  Applicability and applicable regulations 
New development proposed in cooperative planning areas within 500 feet of the existing built environment, or within 500 feet of platted lots shall comply with the standards stated in this subsection (b)(3). In addition, such development shall also comply with the general compatibility standards stated in subsection (b)(4) below, as applicable. 
b.  Internal density transfers allowed. 
To the extent that land in such areas affected by this standard would be buildable under federal, state, or local regulations, the full eligible density may be utilized on other locations on the site. 
c.  Lot adjacency standards-Large-lot single-family residential (SFR)-to-SFR. 
To provide adequate transition between varying sizes of single-family residential parcels designated one dwelling unit per five acres to one dwelling unit per acre, the minimum adjacent lot size shall be one acre. 
d.  Lot adjacency standards-Single-family residential (SFR)-to-SFR. 
To provide adequate transition between varying sizes of single-family residential parcels designated as one unit per acre or greater density, one of the following methods shall be utilized: 
1.  Parcel size matching. 
The minimum lot sizes identified in the land use designation of the immediately adjacent developed subdivision shall be maintained at the edge of the proposed subdivision as depicted in Figure 18.08-11; or 
  
2.  Buffering. A "buffer zone" shall be established. When the buffer remains natural vegetation, the buffer zone shall be equivalent to 100 feet or one-half of the average minimum lot depth of the adjoining developed property, whichever is greater (see Figure 18.08-12). The buffer zone may be common open space for the proposed subdivision and may include paths, trails or other subdivision amenities; or 
  
3.  Yard matching. The rear yard widths of the proposed development shall match the rear yard widths of the existing development as depicted in Figure 18.08-13. 
In addition, lots proposed within a new subdivision that share a common property line with an established subdivision shall not contain structures that exceed the maximum height of the adjacent equivalent zoning district or land use district. 
  
e.  Lot adjacency standards-Multi-family residential (MFR)-to-SFR. To provide adequate transition between multi-family and single-family residential parcels, the development code standards of the closest cooperative planning agency, City of Reno or City of Sparks shall apply. 
f.  Lot adjacency standards-Residential (SFR and MFR)-to-nonresidential. To provide adequate transition between nonresidential parcels and MFR parcels, and between nonresidential parcels and SFR the development code standards of the closest cooperative planning agency, City of Reno or City of Sparks shall apply. 
g.  Lot adjacency standards-Nonresidential-to-nonresidential. To provide adequate transition between varying uses on parcels designated nonresidential, the side and rear setbacks shall be as required by the Washoe County Code. 
(3)  Generally applicable site compatibility and adjacency standards. The following site compatibility and adjacency standards shall apply to all development in the CPA Overlay District, including development that is subject to the special compatibility standards stated in subsection (b)(3) above. 
a.  Grading adjacency standards. All grading for subdivision improvements, special use permits, or other discretionary or building permits adjacent to lots up to five acres in size shall: 
1.  Not result in slopes on fill in excess of, or steeper than, three horizontal to one vertical (3:1). 
2.  For a distance of 50 feet from the shared common property line with an existing residence (see Figure 18.08.14), fills shall not differ from the natural grade by more than 48 inches and may not exceed a slope of three horizontal to one vertical (3:1). 

3.  Not result in slopes that differ from the natural grade by more than 20 feet within 500 feet of a shared common property line with existing development. 
4.  Be limited on cut slopes to equal to, or less than, a slope of three to one (3:1). However, major cut slopes, in excess of 100 lineal feet, shall be permitted when the cut slopes include stepped-back structural containment in the form of benches and terraces that include landscaping on the terraces. Rockery walls used to create benches are limited to a maximum vertical height of six feet. The resulting terraces shall include a minimum horizontal width of six feet to provide for the landscaped bench. An exception may be allowed for cuts into stable rock, supported by a geotechnical report. 
5.  Utilize a gradual transition or "rounding or contouring" of the manufactured slope at the intersection of a manufactured cut or fill slope and a natural slope. 
6.  Visually integrate all slope faces (cut or fill) into the natural terrain by a gradual transition or "contouring/rounding" of the manmade land forms into the natural terrain to add sinuosity to the grading of the site. 
7.  Prohibit the use of riprap and gabions as a mechanical stabilization for cut slopes, except where essential for safe access, for passage within the rights-of way of public roads and for storm drainage control device(s). 
8.  Address compatibility with adjacent lots, demonstrate visual impacts to the community, and propose design criteria, landscaping and buffering to mitigate impacts on adjacent property owners and the community's scenic character, if the applicant proposes cut, fills or slopes in excess of the requirements. Alternative materials and procedures supported by adequate engineering documentation may be approved, provided that they meet the aesthetic intent of these requirements and incorporate mitigation. All mitigation shall be reviewed and approved by the administrator. 
b.  Ridgelines. Visually important ridgelines, as identified on the Washoe County Regional Open Space Program, as amended, and also those significant ridgelines identified in the Washoe County Forest Area Plan, the Washoe County North Valleys Area Plan and the Washoe County Verdi Area Plan, all as amended, shall be considered in applications for master plan and zoning map amendments. Applications for master plan and zoning map amendments shall identify how the project furthers the goal of preserving the aesthetic appearance of important ridgelines and shall include information related to the following issues: 
1.  Potential developable areas (zero to 30 percent slope) shall be identified; 
2.  The existing landscape of such slope areas shall be described; and 
3.  Information shall be provided and provisions shall be made to mitigate the visual impact of the project from developed areas, as follows: 
i.  A minimum of three sight-line analyses shall be provided from the existing built environment, generally within one-quarter to one-half mile of the project site. Staff members of the local governments involved in the cooperative plan shall jointly select the locations for the sight-line analyses to represent typical views of the project site from nearby neighborhoods; 
ii.  The maximum height, placement, design and coloration of structures shall be identified to minimize visual impacts of areas identified in the sight-line analyses; and 
iii.  Minimum setbacks and height limits for structures on the back sides of slopes shall be identified to minimize visual impacts of areas identified in the sight-line analyses. 
c.  Light and glare. This subsection sets forth criteria and standards to mitigate impacts caused by lighting and glare. 
1.  Light. All light sources shall be located and installed in such a way as to prevent spillover lighting onto adjoining properties. The following provisions shall apply to all existing and proposed development: 
i.  Any lighting facilities shall be so installed as to reflect away from adjoining properties. Covers must be installed on all lighting fixtures and lamps must not extend below the bottom of the cover. 
ii.  Light standard in or within 100 feet of residential zones shall not exceed 12 feet in height. Additional standard height may be permitted by the administrator provided such lights are a sharp cutoff lighting system. 
iii.  No permanent rotating searchlights shall be permitted in any regulatory zone, except that an administrative permit may be issued by the administrator for a period not to exceed three days for a temporary searchlight. The administrative permit shall be limited to a maximum of three times in any one calendar year. 
2.  Lighting design. The style and intensity of lighting shall consider not only function and appearance, but shall reflect the existing character of surrounding areas and shall replicate natural light as much as possible. 
3.  Glare. Reflected glare on nearby buildings, streets or pedestrian areas shall be avoided by incorporating overhangs and awnings, using non-reflective building materials for exterior walls and roof surfaces, controlling angles of reflection, and placing landscaping and screening in appropriate locations. 
4.  Interior lighting. Where residential uses abut nonresidential uses, interior lighting of the nonresidential uses shall be controlled at night through the use of timers, window blinds, or other acceptable means. This provision shall apply to all existing and proposed development. 
5.  Conflict with other portions of Title 18. Where another provision of Title 18 may conflict with the provisions of this subsection, the more restrictive provision shall control. 
(b)  District-Specific Standards for Protection of Significant Hydrologic Resources.   
(1)  Purpose. To regulate development activity within and adjacent to perennial streams to ensure that these resources are protected and enhanced. This subsection establishes standards for use of land in "critical stream zone buffer area" and "sensitive stream zone buffer area" to preserve and protect perennial streams to implement a policy of "no net loss" of significant hydrological resource size, function and value. The purpose of requiring perennial stream buffer areas is to recognize that many uses directly adjacent to a hydrologic resource may compromise the integrity of the resource through various negative features endemic to the specific use. Negative activities in the buffer areas may impact the quality or quantity of the existing hydrology, soil characteristics, vegetation communities or topography thereby jeopardizing the resource's functions. The intent of these regulations is to protect the public health, safety and welfare by: 
a.  Preserving, protecting and restoring the natural functions of existing perennial streams; 
b.  Reducing the need for the expenditure of public funds to remedy or avoid flood hazards, erosion, or other situations caused by inappropriate alterations of streams; 
c.  Ensuring the natural flood control functions of perennial streams including, but not limited to, stormwater retention and slow-release detention capabilities are maintained; 
d.  Ensuring stormwater runoff and erosion control techniques are utilized to stabilize existing stream banks, reduce downstream sediment loading, and ensure the safety of people and property; 
e.  Ensuring the natural water quality functions of perennial streams including, but not limited to, pollution filtering, groundwater recharge, nutrient storage, nutrient recycling capabilities, and sediment filtering capabilities are not impacted by existing and proposed developments; 
f.  Encouraging common open space developments to avoid hazardous or environmentally sensitive areas, protect important habitat and open space areas, and minimize impacts on groundwater recharge areas; 
g.  Establishing buffer areas around all significant hydrological resource areas to ensure the resource is not jeopardized or degraded by adjacent offsite development activity; 
h.  Ensuring a no net loss of value, acreage and function of each different significant hydrological resources is adhered to; and 
i.  Identifying, establishing and managing perennial streams as mitigation sites for destroyed or degraded hydrological resources. 
(2)  Applicability. The provisions set forth in this Section 18.08.404(c) shall apply as follows: 
a.  Area of applicability. All properties located in the CPA Overlay District and containing either perennial streams, or an established buffer area surrounding one of the perennial streams, as identified on the map entitled "Map of Significant Hydrologic Resources," Figure 18.08-15 below. All new development that requires permitting or review shall be reviewed for compliance with the significant hydrologic resource standards. No variance to the significant hydrologic resource standards shall be processed or approved; instead, please refer to subsection (c)(9) (Modification of Standards) below. 
In determining the location of the above-designated streams, staff shall use: 
1.  Published United States Geological Service (USGS) topographic maps, either in seven and one-half minute or 15 minute series, to assist in the interpretation of location of significant hydrologic resources. 
2.  A determination of the location of a perennial stream resulting from a delineation of wetlands and/or waters of the United States made by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under the provisions of Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act, shall be considered the perennial stream crossing any parcel of land. 
3.  Field survey by land surveyor or professional engineer licensed and qualified to perform a survey. 
b.  Relationship to other restrictions. The requirements established in this Section 18.08.404(c) are not intended to repeal, abrogate, supersede or impair any existing federal, state or local law, easement, covenant, or deed restriction. However, if this subsection imposes greater or more stringent restrictions, the provisions of this subsection shall prevail. Specifically, if an applicant also acquires authorization under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act from the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the applicant shall meet any greater or more stringent restrictions set forth in this subsection in addition to and independent of the restrictions of such permit. 
c.  Application of this subsection to the Truckee River. The provisions of this Section 18.08.404(c) do not apply for development along the Truckee River from the California/Nevada state line to the terminus in Pyramid Lake. 
  
d.  Impact on land use designations. The provisions of this Section 18.08.404(c) shall neither be used as justification for changing a land use designation nor be used to reduce the development density or intensity otherwise allowed by the land use designation of the property, subject to the provisions and limitations of this subsection. 
(3)  Exemptions. The following are exempt from the provisions of this Section 18.08.404(c): 
a.  All existing allowable or permitted use of any single-family, detached, residential structure, including interior renovation, and replacement upon catastrophic damaging event, and all related accessory uses (e.g. garages, barns, corrals, storage sheds) constructed or under construction with a valid building permit prior to the effective date of this ordinance. 
b.  All projects with an approved special use permit, any map to divide land, design standards handbook and/or development agreement, currently active (not expired) and having obtained approval or having submitted a valid discretionary permit application prior to the effective date of this ordinance. 
(4)  Perennial streams buffer areas. Perennial stream buffer areas are established to provide adequate setbacks and land use controls to ensure water quality functions of each perennial stream are not jeopardized through development activity. To limit significant impacts adjacent to hydrological resources, two buffer areas are hereby established-the "critical stream zone buffer area" and the "sensitive stream zone buffer area." All proposals to develop uses within the critical stream zone buffer area and/or the sensitive stream zone buffer area shall submit a site plan with precise dimensions depicting the boundary line for the buffer areas. 
a.  Critical stream zone buffer area. The critical stream zone buffer area shall be all land and water surface within 30 feet from the centerline of the perennial stream. The centerline of the stream shall be determined by either survey from a licensed surveyor or by determination of the thalweg (i.e. the line connecting points of maximum water depth) from a topographic survey, or appropriate USGS seven and one-half-minute topographic map covering the site. 
b.  Sensitive stream zone buffer area. The sensitive stream zone buffer area shall be all land and water surface between the critical stream zone buffer area boundary of 30 and 150 feet from centerline or thalweg of the perennial stream. 
(5)  Critical stream zone buffer area development standards. All development in the critical stream zone buffer area shall be subject to the following standards: 
a.  Allowed uses. Uses allowed within the critical stream zone buffer area are limited to those uses necessary for providing community services such as managing and conserving natural resources, and providing recreational and educational opportunities, including: 
1.  Weed control consistent with state and county laws. 
2.  Mosquito abatement consistent with state and county laws. 
3.  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife habitats.

Written notice shall be provided to the community development department at least 15 days prior to the commencement of work, and all impacts to the critical stream zone buffer area are minimized and disturbed areas are immediately restored to their natural state. 
7.  Landscape improvements and maintenance of native vegetation is allowed within an established critical stream zone buffer area including the pruning of trees and the removal of dead vegetation and debris. Ornamental landscaping that would require fertilizer or pesticide applications for growth and maintenance is not permitted within the critical stream buffer zone area. 
8.  Landscaping area requirements may be satisfied by using the natural, undisturbed or restored critical stream zone buffer area to count towards the required area to be landscaped for new residential, civic, commercial, industrial or agricultural use types. Parking and loading areas on the developed portion of the site shall continue to require landscaping. Open space requirements may be satisfied by using the natural, undisturbed or restored critical stream zone buffer area. 
9.  Continuation of existing agricultural operations such as the cultivation and harvesting of hay or pasturing of livestock, or change of agricultural practices such as the relocation of an existing pasture fence, which has no greater impact on perennial stream water quality. 
10.  Perimeter fencing on a property boundary with a valid building permit pursuant to approval by the administrator to ensure that obstruction to stream flows has been avoided. 
b.  Permitted uses requiring a planning commission approved special use permit. Subject to the regulatory zone in effect for the property establishing the uses, the following use types may be permitted in the critical stream zone buffer area pursuant to a special use permit being issued by the planning commission and this Section 18.08.404(c). Any construction in the critical stream zone buffer area will require submission of a grading plan showing compliance with applicable best management practices to minimize stream bank and stream bed erosion. The grading plan shall also be designed to prevent construction drainage and materials from increasing sedimentation impacts to the stream environment and to minimize impervious surfaces. 
1.  Construction or enlargement of any public or private roads, driveway, structure or facility including drainage facilities, water conveyance structures, dams, trails and any public or private utility facility used to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telecommunication or other services. 
2.  Civic use types. Civic uses classified under the utility services, nature center, active recreation, passive recreation and safety services use types may be permitted in the critical stream zone buffer area. 
c.  Prohibited uses. Due to the incompatible nature of certain uses (i.e. ground disturbance, untreated water discharge, hazardous materials, chemical contamination, scale of use, traffic, etc.) and the potential negative impacts on the perennial stream and adjoining critical stream zone buffer area, all new construction and development uses not listed in either the allowed or permitted section of this Section 18.08.404(c) shall not be established in the critical stream zone buffer area. 
1.  Residential, civic, commercial, industrial and agricultural use types. All new residential, civic, commercial, industrial and agricultural use types not listed as allowed or permitted uses are prohibited in the critical stream zone buffer area. Specifically prohibited industrial uses include:

2.  Parking and ornamental landscaping. All new parking and ornamental landscaping areas to fulfill the minimum requirements for new residential, civic, commercial, industrial or agricultural use types shall be prohibited in the critical stream zone buffer area. 
3.  Fences. In order to prevent livestock from destroying the stream bank slope, all new perpendicular-oriented fences except as provided in subsection (6)a. below shall be prohibited in the critical stream zone buffer area. Fencing that is parallel to the stream and is designed to keep livestock from access to the water and stream bank may be permitted after review and approval by the community development department. 
(6)  Sensitive stream zone buffer area development standards. Development in the sensitive stream zone area shall be subject to the following standards: 
a.  Allowed uses. All allowed uses within the critical stream zone buffer area are also allowed in the sensitive stream zone buffer area. Additional allowed uses in the sensitive stream zone buffer area include: 
1.  Single-family, detached residential uses and all related accessory uses associated with the single-family residence requiring a building permit. Attached or detached accessory dwellings may also be erected within the sensitive stream zone buffer area. New building structures such as storage sheds and gazebos that, due to their minimum floor area, do not require a building permit may also be erected within the sensitive stream zone buffer area. 
2.  Landscaping area requirements, including ornamental landscape planting, may be satisfied by using the sensitive stream zone buffer area to count towards the required area to be landscaped for new residential, civic, commercial, industrial or agricultural use types. Parking and loading areas on the developed portion of the site shall continue to require landscaping. Open space requirements may be satisfied by using the natural, undisturbed or restored sensitive stream zone buffer area. 
3.  New fencing, constructed in accordance with the Reno Municipal Code. 
b.  Permitted uses requiring a planning commission approved special use permit. Subject to the regulatory zone in effect for the property, all new use types may be permitted in the sensitive stream zone buffer area pursuant to a special use permit being issued by the planning commission. The special use permit requirement is also applicable to construction or enlargement of any public or private roads, driveway, structure or facility including drainage facilities, water conveyance structures, dams, trails, and any public or private utility facility used to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telecommunication or other services. New residential, commercial and industrial subdivisions shall not require the concurrent processing of a special use permit, as long as the "special review considerations" of this Section 18.08.404(c) are addressed in the tentative subdivision map review. Any construction in the sensitive stream zone buffer area will require submission of a grading plan showing compliance with applicable best management practices. The grading plan shall also be designed to prevent construction drainage and materials from increasing sedimentation impacts to the stream environment and to minimize impervious surfaces. 
c.  Prohibited uses. Due to the incompatible nature of certain uses (i.e. ground disturbance, untreated water discharge, hazardous materials, chemical contamination, scale of use, traffic, etc.) and the potential negative impacts on the perennial stream and adjoining sensitive stream zone buffer area, the following uses shall not be established in the sensitive steam zone buffer area: 
1.  Aggregate facilities-Permanent. 
2.  Aggregate facilities-Temporary. 
3.  Energy production. 
4.  General industrial-Heavy. 
5.  Inoperable vehicle storage.

a.  Appeals for errors. Appeals shall be processed in accordance with Section 18.06.208 (Appeals). 
b.  Special exceptions. The planning commission shall hear and decide requests for special exceptions from the requirements of this Section 18.08.404(c). In approving such applications, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations and all relevant requirements, factors and standards specified in this subsection and shall also consider the provisions of this subsection: 
1.  The potential degradation of the stream environment. 
2.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 
3.  The loss of critical habitat. 
c.  Issuance of special exception. Special exceptions shall only be issued when in compliance with the provisions of this subsection and the planning commission finds: 
1.  A showing of good and sufficient cause such as renovation, rehabilitation or reconstruction of the stream environment; or 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the special exception would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, such as deprivation of a substantial use of property and that the granting of a special exception will not result in degradation of the stream environment. 
d.  Extent of special exception. Special exceptions shall only be issued upon a determination that the special exception is the minimum necessary to afford relief. 
e.  Conditions of special exceptions. Upon consideration of the factors set forth in this Section 18.08.404(c) and the purpose of this section, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of special exceptions as it deems necessary to further the purpose of Section 18.08.404(c).

c.  Architectural Character. Due to the wide range of architectural styles found in the neighborhood's residential areas (Figure 18.08-26), the use of one or more specific architectural styles is not mandated. However, infill development and major renovations to existing structures shall be designed to complement the established framework of the neighborhood in terms of its streetscape quality, block pattern, and overall urban neighborhood character (Figure 18.08-27). These general residential standards are not intended to promote the replication of historic styles found in the neighborhood, but rather to encourage a range of architectural styles that reflect the diversity of the neighborhood. 

Figure 18.08-27: Examples of Infill Development - These examples (Denver, CO) demonstrate respect for the established neighborhood framework while still incorporating a range of architectural styles. This is accomplished through the use of similar setbacks, continuation of established streetscape character and compatible height and building massing.

(5)  Hillside Development.   
a.  Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to regulate hillsides in a manner different from regulation of flat terrain. This subsection establishes provisions for developing, preserving and protecting hillsides and ridgelines with the intent of protecting the public health, safety and welfare by: 
1.  Minimizing use of slopes subject to instability, erosion, landslide, flood hazards or drainage problems; 
2.  Minimizing the careless alteration of and disruption to the natural topography and landscape; 
3.  Providing safe and adequate vehicular and pedestrian access to and within hillside areas, including emergency access; 
4.  Establishing stormwater runoff and erosion control techniques to minimize adverse water quality impacts resulting from non-point runoff; 
5.  Encouraging innovative grading techniques and building design which respond to the hillside terrain and natural contours of the land; 
6.  Minimizing impacts on existing trees and vegetation which reduce erosion, stabilize steep hillsides, enhance visual quality, protect water quality and preserve critical water-shed recharge areas; 
7.  Encouraging the transfer of density to avoid hazardous areas and to protect environmentally sensitive and open space areas; and 
8.  Minimizing impacts on prominent ridgelines, significant viewsheds, canyons and visually prominent rock outcroppings which reflect the visual value and scenic character of hillside areas. 
b.  Applicability. The provisions set forth in this subsection shall apply as follows: 
1.  Hillside and Ridgeline Development. This article applies to all new development that requires tentative maps or special use permits by the City of Reno and containing slopes in excess of 15 percent or greater on 20 percent or more of the site. 
c.  Application requirements and procedures. In place of the application requirements found in the Hillside Development article of Reno Development Code, the following submittals shall be required for all hillside development: 
1.  Site analysis. A site analysis, prepared by a qualified engineer, planner, landscape architect or architect shall be submitted. This analysis shall provide the basis for assessing the opportunities and constraints of the site for development and shall be in the form of a design standards handbook incorporating both textual and graphical representations of the requested action. At a minimum, a site analysis shall indicate: 
i.  Major topographic conditions including ridgelines, ravines canyons and knolls; 
ii.  Preliminary geological conditions including major rock outcroppings, slide areas and areas underlain with faults that have been active during the Holocene epoch of geological time; 
iii.  Preliminary soil conditions including soil type, expansiveness, slumping, erodibility and permeability; 
iv.  Significant surface hydrological conditions including natural drainage courses, perennial streams, floodplains, wetlands and ponding area;

4.  Detailed contour analysis. A topographic map with more or less detailed contour intervals may be required by the zoning administrator for design purposes. 
d.  Determination of developable area. To determine the location and amount of land suitable to support development, a developable area analysis is required on a hillside property. 
1.  Purpose. The purpose of identifying the developable area of a hillside is to designate those areas suited for development and construction as evidenced by soils, geotechnical, biological and hydrological investigations and studies. A developable area analysis is required to ensure that the proposed project complies with the intent, standards and requirements of the MGOD. 
2.  Developable area map. The developable area analysis shall be in the form of a developable area map; shall be drawn at a scale appropriate to the project; shall identify the location and amount of total land area suitable for development pursuant to the standards outlined in "Determination of Developable Area" (below); and shall be prepared by a qualified engineer, planner, landscape architect or architect. 
3.  Determination of developable area. Areas considered less suitable for development include: 
i.  Slopes greater than 30 percent, based on a slope analysis; 
ii.  Areas of landslides or landslide potential; 
iii.  Areas underlain with faults that have been active during the Holocene epoch of geological time; 
iv.  Habitat area of known rare or endangered plant or animal species; and 
v.  Significant streams, ravines and drainageways. 
4.  Exceptions. Development shall be permitted within areas of a hillside property considered less suitable for development by the zoning administrator due to extenuating circumstances, provided the applicant can demonstrate that:

The restriction shall include provisions for the management and maintenance of the property. Where appropriate, open space shall be dedicated to a public agency. 
f.  Site development standards. This subsection sets forth development standards to address the physical and technical conditions unique to hillside and ridgeline property within the MGOD. In case of conflict between the provisions of this subsection and those of any other portion of Reno Municipal Code, the provisions of this subsection shall prevail unless otherwise determined by the director of community development, city engineer, or designated staff from the appropriate fire protection agency. 
1.  Building location. The following standards are intended to encourage compatibility between development and the existing hillside and vegetation character: 
i.  Structures should be located on the natural slope of the land rather than on man-made pads and terraces; 
ii.  Structures should be located in such a manner so as to retain or enhance views, particularly views from public places as identified in the required viewshed analysis and individual residential dwelling units; 
iii.  Development clusters shall be permitted, where appropriate, to preserve natural features, reduce grading and impervious surface area, increase usable open space areas, and preserve views of the hillsides; 
iv.  The character and profile of the hillside should be preserved by using existing disturbed areas for building envelopes rather than undisturbed areas; and 
v.  For projects with multiple buildings, structures should be sited in staggered arrangements and height variation to minimize a "walled" effect. 
2.  Building design. The following standards are intended to encourage building design that is compatible to the character of hillsides and ridgelines and minimize alteration of the natural landforms: 
i.  Split-pad and stepped foundations will be used where appropriate; 
ii.  The use of decks and small patios shall be encouraged to reduce the amount of grading; 
iii.  Structures shall be designed to blend into the natural character of the hillside by reducing the visual bulk through landscaping, terraced building forms and height variations; and 
iv.  A series of smaller, visually distinct roofs, specifically pitched, gabled and hipped roofs, shall be encouraged to reflect the visual diversity of the natural hillsides. 
3.  Building height. Buildings shall not exceed the maximum allowable height standards established for the zoning district in which the structure is located. 
4.  Yards. The following standards are intended to ensure sloped yards are adequately maintained by the dwelling unit physically and visually accessing them: 
i.  Cut or fill slopes should be designed such that they are visible from the residence on the property in which they are located. This will encourage property owners to stabilize, maintain and treat slopes to prevent erosion. 
ii.  Slopes adjacent to a roadway should be designed and maintained in a uniform manner. 
iii.  To promote creative site planning design, residential yard requirements and building placement standards may be reduced by the zoning administrator with a tentative map or special use permit provided the applicant can demonstrate that the reduction: 
• Does not diminish solar access to the primary living space or yard area of an adjoining residence; 
• Does not block views from adjoining lots and streets beyond that which would have occurred without the reduced yard allowance; and 
• Is consistent with the natural hillside character. 
5.  Parking and sidewalks. The following standards are intended to ensure safe and adequate access to residential hillside development areas and to minimize the width of hillside roadways where feasible and as appropriate: 
i.  On lots fronting a street with on-street parking prohibited on both sides of the street, one additional off-street parking space shall be provided per unit; 
ii.  The width of a driveway at curb cut shall not exceed 24 feet, and the distance between two or more curb cuts on the same property shall be at least 20 feet; 
iii.  To reduce the number of curb cuts, amount of grading impervious surface area, and site disturbance, use of common driveways shall be encouraged by the zoning administrator, provided that a common easement maintenance agreement is secured; and 
iv.  Tandem parking may be permitted by the zoning administrator provided that the applicant can demonstrate that such configuration will reduce the amount of grading. 
6.  Lot configuration. The following standards are intended to ensure platting of new lots which reflect the natural character of hillside properties: 
i.  Stable and sufficiently usable areas of land for development shall be provided for each lot; 
ii.  Building envelopes, disturbed areas and areas to remain undisturbed for each created lot shall be shown on the tentative and final maps; 
iii.  Reasonably safe and adequate access from public streets without requiring massive grading or substantial vegetation removal shall be required for each created lot; and 
iv.  Lot patterns which offer a variety of configurations shall be encouraged. 
7.  Fences and walls. The following standards are intended to minimize the visual effect of excessive fencing and retaining walls in hillside and ridgeline development: 
i.  Multiple retaining walls shall be separated horizontally by a distance equal to at least the height of the lower retaining wall and include appropriate landscaping between walls (see also the Community Design subsection standards below), and; 
ii.  A series of smaller retaining walls shall be encouraged rather than one large, uninterrupted wall. 
8.  Significant natural features. Significant natural features shall be protected and preserved where appropriate and feasible including, but not limited to, ridgelines, canyons, ravines, streams and creeks, natural drainages and rock outcroppings. 
9.  Open space and recreational trails. Open space areas and recreational trails provided as part of a hillside development shall be consistent with Figure 18.08-48. 
g.  Grading and drainage standards. This section sets forth development standards for grading of hillside and ridgeline properties. 
1.  Grading. These grading standards are applicable to hillside and ridgeline development only if a special use permit for grading is required pursuant to Reno Municipal Code. The following standards are intended to preserve natural topographic features, foster resource preservation and minimize degradation of the visual character of hillsides: 
i.  Grading shall relate to the natural topography with the natural topography maintained to the greatest extent possible. Mass grading in areas of 30 percent or greater slope shall be avoided unless associated with necessary access, utilities or is in an isolated area not a part of a larger hillside, or significant ridgeline; 
ii.  Where alteration to the natural topography is necessary, graded slopes shall be contoured to provide a smooth and gradual transition of grading and natural slopes, while maintaining the basic character of the terrain; 
iii.  Standard pad grading or terracing which results in grading outside the building footprint and access area shall be discouraged; 
iv.  Grading of knolls, ridgelines or toes of slopes shall be rounded to conform with the natural grades and to provide a smooth transition to the natural slope; 
v.  Grading shall create varying gradients in order to avoid a "manufactured" appearance; 
vi.  Grading in environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall occur only when necessary to protect, maintain, enhance or restore the habitat; and 
vii.  A slope stability and scarring mitigation plan, certificated by the project engineer, shall be reviewed and approved by the zoning administrator prior to initiation of grading. 
2.  Drainage and erosion control. All hillside development shall satisfy current Reno Municipal Code for drainage and erosion control. 
h.  Vegetation preservation and restoration standards. This section sets forth development standards to ensure maximum preservation and restoration of existing trees and vegetation on hillsides and ridgelines, reduce damage from sediment and runoff, improve wildlife habitat, and retain the desirable qualities of hillsides. 
1.  Existing native trees and vegetation. Existing native trees and vegetation shall be retained and integrated into the site development plan to the maximum extent feasible so as to maintain the natural surface drainage system, protect and preserve ecological communities, and enhance the natural scenic and visual quality. 
2.  Disturbed areas. Where existing trees or plants have been removed from hillside or ridgeline properties, the following standards shall apply; 
i.  Existing vegetation shall not be destroyed, removed or disturbed more than 15 days before grading is scheduled to begin; and 
ii.  All graded or disturbed area, exposed slopes and areas of soil or land form disturbance not designated for development shall be revegetated and replanted immediately after grading in order to mitigate adverse visual impacts, improve soil conditions, minimize erosion and stabilize necessary cut and fill slopes with plant roots. 
i.  Street standards. This subsection sets forth development standards to ensure streets and roadways are adequate for serving the unique conditions of hillside areas. 
1.  Applicability. Street standards for hillside and ridgeline properties shall be subject to the provisions of Reno Municipal Code, and be in accordance with a detailed geotechnical engineering investigation that provides recommendations for the following: 
i.  Design of cut and fill slopes; 
ii.  Design of roadway drainage systems; 
iii.  Protection of slopes from erosion; 
iv.  Pavement and structural design; and 
v.  Construction procedures and methods to be used during site grading and roadway construction. 
2.  Standards waiver. The street standards in Reno Municipal Code, Street Design Standards, may be modified for hillside development if the geotechnical investigation indicates that other roadway cross sections are more suitable for the proposed development. Any modifications to the standards must be designed in accordance with Reno Municipal Codes and to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator, city engineer and staff from the appropriate fire protection agency. 
j.  Fire safety standards. This section sets forth development standards to minimize the potential of fire spread and ensure fire safety to hillside areas through the provision of adequate water supply and sources, fuel breaks and fire-resistant landscaping. 
1.  Water provisions. The applicant shall demonstrate that adequate fire line water supply, flow and pressure are available and consistent with standards established by the appropriate fire protection agency, and that all applicable fire hydrant requirements have been fulfilled. 
2.  Building materials. Fire retardant roofing and decking shall be required. 
3.  Fuel breaks. Fuel breaks shall be provided to reduce the risk of spread of wildfire and the opportunity of ignition, and to assure emergency access to the hillside development. The fuel breaks shall be established around all buildings and community facilities, and at appropriate intervals and locations within a hillside development in order to provide safer access for fire fighting and to reduce the rate of fire spread, as follows: 
i.  The perimeter of all buildings shall be cleared of underbrush and excess vegetation; 
ii.  Lot size and building placement shall allow adequate clearance of hazardous flammable vegetation; and 
iii.  Fuel breaks shall allow safe access for fire-fighting personnel and equipment. 
4.  Fire-resistant planting. In high-risk fire areas, the following standards shall apply: 
i.  Existing fire-resistant and fire-retardant plants shall be retained where feasible; 
ii.  The use of fire-resistant and fire-retardant plants shall be encouraged, and the use of highly flammable plants shall be prohibited; 
iii.  New trees shall be planted at least 15 feet from existing and proposed structures. Where this setback is infeasible due to yard requirements or other physical constraints, the use of fire-resistant trees shall be required; 
iv.  Trees shall be pruned such that no dead branches or foliage extend lower than six feet above finished grade within ten feet of a chimney; and 
v.  Yard areas shall be regularly maintained to remove excessive dry wood, debris, weeds and other highly flammable materials. 
(6)  Significant hydrologic resources.   
a.  Purpose. The purpose of this subsection, Significant Hydrologic Resources, is to regulate development activity within and adjacent to perennial streams to ensure that these resources are protected and enhanced. This subsection establishes standards for use of land in "critical stream zone buffer areas" and "sensitive stream zone buffer areas" preserving and protecting perennial streams to implement a policy of "no net loss" of significant hydrological resource size, function and value. The purpose of requiring perennial stream buffer areas is to recognize that many uses directly adjacent to a hydrologic resource may compromise the integrity of the resource through various negative features endemic to the specific use. Negative activities in the buffer areas may impact the quality or quantity of the existing hydrology, soil characteristics, vegetation communities or topography thereby jeopardizing the resource's functions. The intent of these regulations is to protect the public health, safety and welfare by: 
1.  Preserving, protecting and restoring the natural functions of existing perennial streams in Washoe County; 
2.  Reducing the need for the expenditure of public funds to remedy or avoid flood hazards, erosion, or other situations caused by inappropriate alterations of streams; 
3.  Ensuring the natural flood control functions of perennial streams including, but not limited to, stormwater retention and slow-release detention capabilities are maintained; 
4.  Ensuring stormwater runoff and erosion control techniques are utilized to stabilize existing stream banks, reduce downstream sediment loading, and ensure the safety of people and property; 
5.  Ensuring the natural water quality functions of perennial streams including, but not limited to, pollution filtering, groundwater recharge, nutrient storage, nutrient recycling capabilities, and sediment filtering capabilities are not impacted by existing and proposed developments; 
6.  Encouraging common open space to avail hazardous or environmentally sensitive areas, protect important habitat and open space areas, and minimize impacts on groundwater recharge areas; 
7.  Establishing buffer areas around all significant hydrological resource areas to ensure the resource is not jeopardized or degraded by adjacent offsite development activity; 
8.  Ensuring a no net loss of value, acreage and function of each different significant hydrological resources is adhered to; and 
9.  Identifying, establishing and managing perennial streams as mitigation sites for destroyed or degraded hydrological resources. 
b.  Applicability. The provisions set forth in this subsection shall apply as follows: 
1.  Area of applicability: The provisions of this subsection shall apply to the properties identified on Figure 18.08-45, Significant Hydrologic Resources. All new development that requires permitting or review by the city shall be reviewed for compliance with the significant hydrologic resource standards contained herein. 
FIGURE 18.08-45 SIGNIFICANT HYDROLOGIC RESOURCES

2.  Relationship to other restrictions. The requirements established in this subsection are not intended to repeal, abrogate, supersede or impair any existing federal, state or local law, easement, covenant or deed restriction. However, if this article imposes greater or more stringent restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail. Specifically, if an applicant also acquires authorization under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act from the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the applicant shall meet any greater or more stringent restriction set forth in this article in addition to and independent of the restrictions of such permit. 
3.  Application of this article to the Truckee River. The provisions of this article do not apply for development along the Truckee River. 
4.  Impact on land use designations. The provisions of this subsection shall neither be used as justification for changing a land use designation nor be used to reduce the development density or intensity otherwise allowed by the land use designation of the property, subject to the provisions and limitations of the section. 
c.  Perennial streams buffer areas. Perennial stream buffer areas are established to provide adequate setbacks and land use controls to ensure water quality functions of each perennial stream are not jeopardized through development activity. To limit significant impacts adjacent to hydrological resources, two buffer areas are hereby established - the "critical stream zone buffer area" and the "sensitive stream zone buffer area". All proposals to develop uses within the critical stream zone buffer area and/or the sensitive stream zone buffer area shall submit a site plan with precise dimensions depicting the boundary line for the buffer areas. 
1.  Critical stream zone buffer area. The critical stream zone buffer area shall be all land and water surface within 30 feet from the centerline of the perennial stream. The centerline of the stream shall be determined by either survey from a licensed surveyor or by determination of the thalweg (i.e. the line connecting points of maximum water depth) from a topographic survey, or appropriate USGS 7.5 minute topographic map covering the site. 
2.  Sensitive stream zone buffer area. The sensitive stream zone buffer area shall be all land and water surface between the critical stream zone buffer area boundary of 30 and 150 feet from centerline or thalweg of the perennial stream. 
d.  Critical stream zone buffer area development standards. All development in the critical stream zone buffer area shall be subject to the following standards: 
1.  Allowed uses. Uses allowed within the critical stream zone buffer area are limited to those uses necessary for providing community services such as managing and conserving natural resources, and providing recreational and educational opportunities, including: 
i.  Weed control consistent with state and local laws. 
ii.  Mosquito abatement consistent with state and local laws. 
iii.  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife habitats. 
iv.  Outdoor recreation activities such as fishing, bird watching, hiking and swimming. 
v.  Education and scientific research including, but not limited to, water quality monitoring and stream flow gauging. 
vi.  Maintenance of an existing public or private road, driveway, structure or facility, including drainage facilities, water conveyance structures, dams, fences, trails, and any public or private utility facility used to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telecommunication, or other including individual service connections. Written notice shall be provided to the zoning administrator at least 15 days prior to the commencement of work, and all impacts to the critical stream zone buffer area are minimized and disturbed areas are immediately restored to their natural state. 
vii.  Landscape improvements and maintenance of native vegetation is allowed within an established critical stream zone buffer area including the pruning of trees and the removal of dead vegetation and debris. Ornamental landscaping that would require fertilizer of pesticide applications for growth and maintenance is not permitted within the critical stream buffer zone area. 
viii.  Landscaping area requirements in accordance with Reno Municipal Code may be satisfied by using the natural, undisturbed or restored critical stream zone buffer area to county towards the required area to be landscaped for new residential, civic, commercial, industrial or agricultural use types. Parking and loading areas on the developed portion of the site shall continue to require landscaping. 
ix.  Continuation of existing agricultural operations such as the cultivation and harvesting of hay or pasturing of livestock, or change of agricultural practices such as the relocation of an existing pasture fence, which has no greater impact on perennial stream water quality. 
x.  Perimeter fencing on a property boundary with a valid building permit pursuant to approval by the zoning administrator to ensure that obstruction to stream flows has been avoided. 
2.  Permitted uses requiring a planning commission approved special use permit. Subject to the regulatory zone in effect for the property establishing the uses, the following use types may be permitted in the critical stream zone buffer area pursuant to a special use permit being issued by the City of Reno according to the provisions of the Reno Municipal Code, Special Use Permits, and this subsection. Any construction in the critical stream buffer zone area will require submission of a grading plan showing compliance with applicable best management practices as defined by the City of Reno to minimize stream bank and stream bed erosion. The grading plan shall also be designed to prevent construction drainage and materials from increasing sedimentation impacts to the stream environment and to minimize impervious surfaces. 
i.  Construction or enlargement of any public or private roads, driveway, structure or facility including drainage facilities, water conveyance structures, dams, trails and any public or private utility facility used to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telecommunication or other services. 
ii.  Civic Use Types. Civic uses such as a nature center, active recreation, passive recreation and safety services use types may be permitted in the critical stream zone buffer area. 
3.  Prohibited uses. Due to the incompatible nature of certain uses (i.e. ground disturbance, untreated water discharge, hazardous materials, chemical contamination, scale of use, traffic, etc.) and the potential negative impacts on the perennial stream and adjoining critical stream zone buffer area, all new construction and development uses not listed in either the allowed or permitted portions of this subsection shall not be established in the critical stream zone buffer area. 
i.  Residential, civic, commercial, industrial and agricultural use types. All new residential, civic, commercial, industrial, and agricultural use types not listed as allowed or permitted uses are prohibited in the critical stream zone buffer area. Specifically prohibited industrial uses include:

ii.  Parking and ornamental landscaping. All new parking and ornamental landscaping areas to fulfill the minimum requirements for new residential, civic, commercial, industrial or agricultural use types shall be prohibited in the critical stream zone buffer area. 
iii.  Fences. In order to prevent livestock from destroying the stream bank slope, all new perpendicular-oriented fences shall be prohibited in the critical stream zone buffer area. Fencing that is parallel to the stream and is designed to keep livestock from access to the water and stream bank may be permitted after review and approval by the zoning administrator. 
e.  Sensitive stream zone buffer area development standards. All development in the sensitive stream zone area shall be subject to the following standards: 
1.  Allowed uses. All allowed uses within the critical stream zone buffer area are also allowed in the sensitive stream zone buffer area. Additional allowed uses in the sensitive stream zone buffer area include: 
i.  Single-family, detached residential uses with the approval of a tentative map. All related accessory uses associated with the single-family residence requiring a building permit. Attached or detached accessory dwelling may also be erected within the sensitive stream zone buffer area with the approval of a tentative map. New building structures such as storage sheds and gazebos that, due to their minimum floor area, do not require a building permit may also be erected within the sensitive stream buffer area. 
ii.  Landscaping area requirements in accordance with Reno Municipal Code, including ornamental landscape planting, may be satisfied by using the sensitive stream zone buffer area to count towards the required area to be landscaped for new residential, civic, commercial, industrial or agricultural use types. Parking and loading areas on the developed portion of the site shall continue to require landscaping. 
iii.  New fencing, constructed in accordance with Reno Municipal Code. 
2.  Permitted uses requiring a planning commission approved special use permit. Subject to the regulatory zone in effect for the property establishing the uses, all new use types may be permitted in the sensitive stream zone buffer area pursuant to a special use permit being issued by the City of Reno. The special use permit requirement is also applicable to construction or enlargement of any public or private roads, driveway, structure or facility including drainage facilities, water conveyance structures, dams, trails, and any public or private utility facility used to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telecommunication or other services. New residential, commercial and industrial subdivisions processed with a tentative subdivision map, shall not require the concurrent processing of a special use permit, as long as the "Special Review Considerations" of this subsection (below) are addressed in the tentative subdivision map review. Any construction in the sensitive stream zone buffer area will require submission of a grading plan showing compliance with applicable best management practices as defined by the City of Reno to minimize stream bank and streambed erosion. The grading plan shall also be designed to prevent construction drainage and materials from increasing sedimentation impacts to the stream environment and to minimize impervious surfaces. 
3.  Prohibited uses. Due to the incompatible nature of certain uses (i.e. ground disturbance, untreated water discharge, hazardous materials, chemical contamination, scale of use, traffic, etc.) and the potential negative impacts on the perennial stream and adjoining sensitive stream zone buffer area, the following uses shall not be established in the sensitive stream zone buffer area; 
i.  Aggregate facilities-Permanent. 
ii.  Aggregate facilities-Temporary. 
iii.  Energy production. 
iv.  General industrial-Heavy. 
v.  Inoperable vehicle storage.

2.  Special exceptions. The city council shall hear and decide requests for special exceptions from the requirements of this subsection. In passing upon such applications, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations and all relevant requirements, factors and standards specified in the MGOD and shall also consider the following provisions: 
i.  The potential degradation of the stream environment. 
ii.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 
iii.  The loss of critical habitat. 
3.  Issuance of special exception. Special exceptions shall only be issued when in compliance with the provisions of this section and the city council finds: 
i.  A showing of good and sufficient cause such as renovation, rehabilitation or reconstruction of the stream environment; or 
ii.  A determination that failure to grant the special exception would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, such as deprivation of a substantial use of property and that the granting of a special exception will not result in degradation of the stream environment. 
4.  Extent of special exception. Special exceptions shall only be issued upon a determination that the special exception is the minimum necessary to afford relief. 
5.  Conditions of special exceptions. Upon consideration of the factors set forth in this section and the purpose of this subsection, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of special exceptions as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this article. 
h.  Wetlands. Preliminary wetland delineations for the properties included in the MGOD have been prepared by JBR Environmental Consultants, Inc., and Huffman and Associates, Inc. These studies have been included in Supporting Studies Book 2, associated with the Mortensen-Garson Development Standards Handbook. Figure 18.08-46 depicts the general location and extent of potential wetlands and potential Waters of the U.S. within the project boundaries. 
Each tentative map, parcel map and special use permit must show the wetlands and waters of the U.S. Wetlands within the project will be protected and mitigated according to Reno Municipal Code, Wetlands and Stream Environments. Wetlands will be avoided and retained as open space unless the location of the wetland and or the physical characteristics of the site necessitate modification of a wetland. In this instance, the wetland must be replaced at a minimum 2:1 ratio of as required by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, whichever is more restrictive. 
FIGURE 18.08-46: WETLANDS MAP 

(7)  Ridgelines. Figure 18.08-47 defines the significant ridgelines that are found within the MGOD. Development immediately adjacent to these ridgelines shall provide the following treatments to minimize visual impact to I-80: 
a.  Minimum structure setback of 45 feet from the ridgeline; or 
b.  Single story building height limitation and landscape treatments consisting of the use of existing or additional evergreen trees and shrubs for screening of structures. Landscaping shall consist of plant material that is either identical or similar to existing plant material; or 
c.  Structures stepped into the hillside and landscape treatments consisting of the use of existing or additional evergreen trees and shrubs for screening of structures. Landscaping shall consist of plant material that is either identical or similar to existing plant material. 
FIGURE 18.08-47: RIDGELINES 

(8)  Edge matching. New development adjacent to the existing developments of Blue Heron, Verdi Bluffs and Canyon Ranch Estates subdivisions shall provide an edge density and lot size for edge lots equal to or less dense than the above-referenced subdivisions, or shall provide an open space buffer equal to at least one lot depth of the above-referenced subdivisions. This standard in no event requires an edge lot size of buffer in excess of one acre in size. 
(9)  Exterior lighting. The purpose of this section is to provide outdoor lighting standards that will improve safety, minimize glare and light trespass, and conserve energy for businesses and the residents of the Verdi area. Lighting will vary from larger scale roadway lighting to more intimate pedestrian scale lighting. Lighting will be used to create mood and reinforce the character of distinct areas within the project. Lighting will also be designed to be minimal, from the perspective of nurturing "dark sky" in most project areas. Lighting will be designed according to City of Reno standards and modified for the nurturing of "dark skies", to the approval of the city. 
a.  Light. All exterior light sources shall be located and installed in such a way as to prevent spillover lighting onto adjoining properties. All light fixtures shall be located, aimed or shielded so as to minimize light trespass across property boundaries. Where applicable, all commercial installations shall utilize house-side shielding to minimize light trespass on residential properties. The following provisions shall apply to all existing and proposed development: 
1.  Any lighting facilities shall be so installed as to reflect away from adjoining properties. Covers must be installed on all lighting fixtures and lamps must not extend below the bottom of the cover. 
2.  Light standard in or within 100 feet of residential zones shall not exceed 12 feet in height. Additional standard height may be permitted by the City of Reno Zoning Administrator provided such lights are a sharp cutoff lighting system. 
3.  No permanent rotating searchlights shall be permitted in any regulatory zone, except that an administrative permit may be issued by the Reno Zoning Administrator for a period not to exceed three days for a temporary search light. The administrative permit shall be limited to a maximum of three times in any one calendar year. 
b.  Shielding. Full Cutoff lighting is strongly recommended. Where Full Cutoff fixtures are not utilized, acceptable outdoor light fixtures shall include those which: 
1.  Are provided with internal and/or external glare control louvers and installed so as to minimize uplight and offsite light trespass, and 
2.  Are installed and maintained with aiming angles that permit no greater than five percent of the light emitted by each fixture to project above the horizontal. 
c.  Lighting design. The style and intensity of lighting shall consider not only function and appearance, but shall reflect the existing character of surrounding areas and shall replicate natural light as much as possible. 
d.  Glare. Reflected glare on nearby buildings, streets or pedestrian areas shall be avoided by incorporating overhangs and awnings, using non-reflective building materials for exterior walls and roof surfaces, controlling angles or reflection, and placing landscaping and screening in appropriate locations. 
e.  Reduced lighting levels. Lighting levels shall be reduced to security levels within 60 minutes after the close of business or the end of the business activity. 
f.  General lighting standards.   
1.  Lighting levels should be limited to effect "dark skies"; 
2.  Fixture scale and illumination levels will be consistent with the specific use; 
3.  Fixtures will employ cutoff features, refractors, or housing shields to eliminate lighting spillover onto adjoining uses where the light would be a nuisance; and 
4.  Use energy efficient lighting design. 
g.  Streetlighting.   
1.  Locate streetlights to provide safe illumination of roadways and to minimize glare. At a minimum, streetlights will be located at all intersections, pedestrian crossings, bus stops, and traffic circles; 
2.  The scale and spacing of streetlights will reflect the street hierarchy; 
3.  Care will be taken to ensure the project's street lighting is unobtrusive and optimized to afford views of the night sky; 
4.  Streetlights will be submitted for approval and inclusion in the Sierra Pacific Power Company streetlight program prior to approval of the applicable Final Map; and 
5.  Streetlights will have individual photocontrol units. 
h.  Pedestrian lighting. Pedestrian lighting will reflect the level of activity intended for the specific area. Higher light levels are appropriate in intensive use areas such as hotel casino, shopping districts or plazas. Low light levels are appropriate in more natural areas. Where little or not light will be provided in adjacent areas, low lighting levels will be used to prevent "blind spots" at the interface between lit and unlit areas. 
i.  Residential lighting standards.   
1.  Exterior fixtures mounted on buildings will be no higher than the line of the first story eave or, where no eave exists, no higher than 12 feet above finished grade and shall be shielded to reduce spillover on adjacent properties. 
j.  Commercial lighting standards.   
1.  Commercial area lighting will coordinate with the associated building architecture; 
2.  Building lighting will clarify pedestrian routes and highlight building entries; 
3.  At a minimum, commercial areas will provide parking lot lighting and lighting at all pedestrian routes; 
4.  Building lighting will be integrated with the architectural design of the building with no exposed bulbs; 
5.  Building illumination and architectural lighting will be indirect in character. Overhead down lighting or interior illumination, which spills outside is encouraged. Architectural lighting will accent and animate the building in addition to providing functional lighting for safety; 
6.  Service area lighting will be contained within the service area boundaries and enclosure walls; 
7.  Locate lighting fixtures to reduce shadow or interference from trees and other objects in the landscape; 
8.  Parking lot lights will clarify vehicular and pedestrian circulation routes; and 
9.  Parking lot light standards will not exceed 25 feet in height unless the zoning administrator determines that a higher light standard will result in an overall reduction in lighting impact. 
(10)  Parks and trails. Figure 18.08.48 depicts the parks and trails plan of the MGOD and shall be implemented with tentative maps and special use permits. Trails in addition to those shown in Figure 18.08-48 may be required with tentative maps. The MGOD shall include: 
a.  Public access through the MGOD to connect with U.S. Forest Service lands to the south and north of the Overlay District;

c.  Five Trailheads to be generally located as follows: 
1.  At the southern edge of Planning Area 1 to access the trail network through the Planning Area 1 and provide access to the Bull Ranch Road trailhead proposed within the Somersett PUD; 
2.  At the north end of Planning Area 2, providing pedestrian access to a trail that currently extends to the Truckee River; 
3.  At the northern edge of Planning Area 3 adjacent to Steamboat Ditch; 
4.  At the southeast edge of Planning Area 3 adjacent to USFS land; and 
5.  At the southwest edge of Planning Area 3 adjacent to Steamboat Ditch and an existing trail. 
d.  Trails will be designed to address their physical setting, intensity of use and proposed interconnection to offsite trails. 
e.  Minimum of six parking spaces will be provided at each trailhead. Trailhead parking lots shall be designed such that no home will lie within 75 feet of any parking lot. 
f.  Pedestrian and bicycle access will be provided within the Business Park (IC) area located along the southwest portion of Planning Area 3. 
g.  Three parcels in Planning Area 2 (APN's 038-100-10, 11 & 12) will be dedicated to the City of Reno with the first Final Map associated with Planning Area 1. 
FIGURE 18.08-48: PARKS & TRAILS PLAN 

h.  Three new parks shall be constructed and shall be open to the public. Parks shown are approximately three to five acres in size, for a minimum total of 15 acres. Exact park details including size, timing, location and amenities/features to be included in each park will be subject to the approval of the director of parks, recreation and community services and the community development director. Specific size and location of parks will be shown with individual tentative maps. Smaller pocket parks maintained by a Homeowner's Association may be built to supplement the parks shown on Figure 18.08-48. Timing of construction and details of park tax crediting may be addressed in parks agreements between the property owner and the city. Unless an alternate timeframe is approved by the director of parks, recreation and community services and the community development director, park land shall be dedicated as follows: 
1.  Park 1-With the first final map for residential development in Planning Area 1. 
2.  Park 2-With the first final map for any development adjacent to the park site. 
3.  Park 3-With the first final map for any development adjacent to the park site.

Groundwater shall supplement the surface water supply in peak times and as approved by the State Water Engineer. The city shall require the water supplier to follow the plan above. 
Community water systems will be extended to the property lines in those areas adjacent to the existing subdivisions of Blue Heron and Verdi Bluff. 
(14)  Fire services. The 2.9 acre public facility site located in Planning Area 3 will be dedicated to the City of Reno with the first final map in Planning Area 3. 
(15)  Administration/amendments.   
a.  Amendments. The base zoning for each parcel in the MGOD will be consistent with the designations and standards of the Reno Municipal Code Title 18.06. The maximum density for each property may only exceed or change from those shown in and Table 18.08-47 and 48 and implemented through adopted base zoning, consistent with the following: 
1.  The total amount of development resulting from any change in density shall not exceed 3,000 dwelling units and 300 commercial acres cumulatively for all the properties in the MGOD. 
2.  No density increases are permitted along the exterior of the property for the areas immediately adjacent to Verdi Bluff, Blue Heron and the Canyon Ranch Estates unless the zoning/land use designations on these abutting properties are increased. 
3.  Density increases by a maximum of ten percent may be approved by the zoning administrator or through the tentative map and/or special use permit process. 
4.  Density increases of up to 25 percent may be allowed subject to a public hearing process with a tentative map or special use permit provided the planning process includes a review of any such application by the Verdi Township CAB and Northwest NAB. 
5.  Density increases beyond 25 percent will require a zoning map amendment application and be processed in the same manner as the original overlay district or development standards handbook (i.e. procedures established in the Settlement Agreement). 
6.  Properties owned by Boomtown and zoned HC may be converted to AC and still be considered consistent with this overlay provided such rezoning occurs through the City of Reno zoning amendment public hearing process. 
b.  Archaeological studies. Tentative maps will include archaeological surveys. 
c.  Verdi Township Citizens Advisory & Northwest Neighborhood Advisory Board Review. All tentative maps, special use permits or zone change applications shall be presented to the Verdi Township Citizen's Advisory Board and the Northwest Neighborhood Advisory Board for comment prior to City of Reno public hearing.

ARTICLE V: - NONCONFORMITIES 

Section 18.08.501. - General Provisions. 
(a)  Intent. Within the zoning districts established by this chapter, there may exist lots, structures, and uses of land which were lawful before the adoption of this title or chapter and any other previous chapter and which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this title or chapter. It is the intent of this article to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed or abandoned, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this article that nonconforming lots, buildings, or uses shall not be enlarged, expanded or extended, except as specifically provided in this article. In addition, nonconforming lots, site improvements, or uses may not be used as justification for adding other lots, buildings or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zoning district. Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the same zoning districts. 
(Ord. No. 5189, § 1, 9-26-00) 
(b)  Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to the following types of situations, all of which are collectively referred to as "nonconformities": 
(1)  Nonconforming uses.   
a.  General rule. A "nonconforming use" is use of land or a building that was legally established but which, as of the effective date of this Title 18 or subsequent amendments thereto, no longer complies with this Chapter 18.08's use regulations that apply within the zoning district (base and/or overlay district) in which the use is located. For purposes of this provision, "use regulations" mean any standard that allows or limits principal or accessory land uses as stated in Articles II, III, and IV of this Chapter 18.08. 
b.  Exception for conforming uses without required use permit. Except as otherwise limited by this Article V, a use legally established without a special use permit is deemed to have a special use permit, and shall not be nonconforming solely because this chapter now requires a special use permit for the subject use. 
(2)  Nonconforming lots. A "nonconforming lot" is a lot of record legally established but which, as of the effective date of this Title 18 or subsequent amendments thereto, no longer complies with the dimensional standards of the applicable base and/or overlay zoning district(s). For purposes of this provision, "dimensional standards" mean any standard stated in this Chapter 18.08 or in Chapter 18.12 regulating lot area, lot width (or frontage), or lot depth. 
(3)  Nonconforming signs. See Chapter 18.16 (Signs) for specific provisions related to nonconforming signs. 
(4)  Nonconforming site improvements. A nonconforming site improvement is a site improvement, other than a sign, that does not comply with current requirements of this title. 
(c)  Authority to Continue. Nonconformities may be continued only according to the provisions of this Article V and other provisions of this title. 
(Ord. No. 5189, § 1, 9-26-00) 
Section 18.08.502. - Nonconforming Uses. 
Nonconforming uses shall be subject to the following standards. 
(a)  Continuance of a Nonconforming Use of Land or Building. A lawful nonconforming use of land or buildings may be continued, except as provided in this article. 
(b)  Changing a Use to be in Conformance.   
(1)  Any nonconforming use of land or building may be changed to bring such use into conformity with this chapter and title. 
(2)  The administrator may permit nonconforming uses to be modified if: 
a.  A nonconforming use is being brought into closer conformity with the code; and 
b.  The administrator makes a determination that the public is better served. 
(c)  Abandonment of a Nonconforming Use or Building. A lawful use of nonconforming land or buildings which are abandoned or discontinued for a period of six consecutive months or more may only be resumed with a special use permit reviewed by the planning commission and approved by the city council. A special use permit for nonconforming gaming in the HC District shall meet the findings in Section 18.08.502(d)(2) below. 
(d)  Expansion of Nonconforming Uses.   
(1)  Special use permit required. Except as provided in this section, within an overlay district, or as permitted in Section 18.08.301 "Nonresidential and Mixed Use Base Zoning Districts," no nonconforming use of land or building shall be enlarged, extended, or changed to a different nonconforming use, unless an application for a special use permit for the enlargement, extension, or change has first been approved in accordance with Section 18.06.405 (Special Use Permits). A special use permit may be approved subject to the findings in Section 18.06.405(e). 
(2)  Nonconforming gaming use or hotel casino.   
a.  If the application for a special use permit is in conjunction with the proposed resumption or expansion of a nonconforming gaming use or nonconforming hotel casino, then the planning commission and city council shall make the following finding in addition to the findings required in Subsection (d)(1) above: 
1.  The expansion of the nonconforming gaming use or nonconforming hotel casino is proposed in a manner which will bring the use into closer conformance with the purpose, operational characteristics, and site development standards of the HC (Hotel Casino) District, or the MU/DRRC (Downtown Reno Regional Center Overlay District), as applicable. 
b.  A legally established nonconforming gaming use or hotel casino displaced (forced to relocate or close) as a result of a redevelopment project may relocate pursuant to NRS 463.1605 within the MU/DRRC, subject to the following conditions: 
1.  The property on which the business will relocate is located in the Entertainment District of the Downtown Reno Regional Center Overlay District; 
2.  No nonconforming aspect of the business is increased; 
3.  Business square footage is not increased more than ten percent; and 
4.  Where site conditions allow, the use shall be brought into closer conformity with other sections of the title (parking, landscaping, public space). 
5.  The property/business shall be considered conforming under current codes when 1.-4. above are met. 
6.  Any rights perceived to accrue by virtue of 1.-5. above, above and beyond rights generally held by nonconforming properties terminate after one relocation. 
(3)  Nonconforming property or business displaced by ReTRAC. A legally established nonconforming use of land or a building displaced (forced to relocate temporarily or permanently) as a result of ReTRAC may relocate subject to the following conditions: 
a.  The use is allowed by the property's zoning; 
b.  No nonconforming aspect of the business or property's site conditions is increased; 
c.  A binding agreement is entered into with the city which:

4.  Guarantees performance; and 
5.  Is binding on all future successors and assigns. 
(4)  Properties temporarily impacted by ReTRAC.   
a.  Property/business owners wishing to make improvements to their property or business which are expected to be damaged/impacted by ReTRAC (e.g., landscaping placed under the shoofly) may bond those improvements. 
b.  Improvements required by Code or operation of the redevelopment agency shall be installed within one year of completion of ReTRAC or official determination by the city that ReTRAC will not proceed. 
(e)  Restoration After Damage.   
(1)  Restoration prohibited. Except as allowed by subsection (2) below, no building devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use that is damaged or partially destroyed by natural calamity to an extent greater than 50 percent of its assessed value, shall be repaired, reconstructed, moved, or altered except in conformity with the provisions of this Title 18. 
(2)  Exceptions. A building that is devoted in whole or in part to nonconforming school, church/house of worship, or single-family use, or a historic structure devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, may be restored and the nonconforming use re-established after damage to an extent greater than 50 percent of the building's assessed value, provided the following conditions are met:

CHAPTER 18.10 - DIVISIONS OF LAND 
OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER 
Chapter 18.10 of Title 18 is the city's subdivision ordinance, setting forth general and specific provisions regulating the division of land in Reno. Chapter 18.10's subdivision standards work together with the general development and design standards in Chapter 18.12, the zoning district and use standards in Chapter 18.08, the improvement standards in Chapter 18.14, the sign standards in Chapter 18.16, and the historic preservation standards in Chapter 18.18 to comprise the substantive standards governing new development in the City of Reno. 
This chapter first presents general provisions in Article I , such as purpose, applicability, and parcel map requirements for the creation of four or fewer new lots. Article II then provides the specific plan/plat application and submittal requirements for all land division applications reviewed under the procedures set forth in Chapter 18.06 of this title. Article III states the development and design standards applicable to all divisions of land in Reno; in particular, consistency with the City of Reno Master Plan and compliance with general development and design standards found in other parts of Title 18. Finally, Article IV of this chapter sets forth the standards and requirements for a unique kind of subdivision-the creation of residential condominiums, including special standards when existing rental residential developments are converted to condominiums. 
ARTICLE I: - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Section 18.10.101. - Purpose, Scope, and Authority. 
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Reno subdivision ordinance." Its purpose is to safeguard the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare and to bring about an orderly, coordinated development of the area by establishing minimum requirements for any subdivision hereafter platted in the incorporated area of the city. The regulations herein set forth are authorized by NRS Chapter 278. 
(Ord. No. 3074, § 2, 4-11-83; Ord. No. 3125, § 1, 9-12-83; Ord. No. 3359, § 1, 2-10-86) 
Section 18.10.102. - Applicability. 
This chapter shall apply to all divisions, subdivisions, and re-subdivisions of land in the City of Reno, and all other lands the city may have control over under NRS Chapter 278, except as may be exempted according to Nevada law, this chapter, or this title. The term "subdivision" has the meaning ascribed to it in Chapter 18.24 (Rules of Measurement and Definitions) of this title. Development in a Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zoning District or Specific Plan (SPD) Zoning District is also subject to the subdivision standards in this Chapter 18.10 unless otherwise modified or varied through the PUD or SPD approval process. 
Section 18.10.103. - Compliance Prior to Sale. 
It is unlawful for any individual, firm, association, corporation or partnership as principal or agent, to sell, or cause or permit to be sold any portion of any subdivision of land within the meaning of this chapter prior to the recording of the final plat in the office of the county recorder. 
Section 18.10.104. - Minimum Requirements. 
The provisions of these regulations shall be held to be minimum requirements only, and are not intended to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any manner interfere with any existing covenants or rules; however, where these regulations impose a greater restriction than is required by such existing covenants or rules, the provisions of these regulations shall govern. 
Section 18.10.105. - Exceptions. 
In conjunction with the approval of a land division, the planning commission may recommend and the city council may approve exceptions to strict conformance with the requirements of this Chapter 18.10 or with the street and utility development standards in Chapter 18.12, and substitute specific requirements as outlined in the plans and specifications submitted by the applicant. Exceptions may be granted upon the applicant's showing that strict compliance is impractical or impossible and when, taking into consideration the overall environmental impact or aesthetic values of public or private improvements, the city council finds that the public interest will be served thereby. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to authorize departure from construction specifications contained in this title applicable to improvements actually constructed or installed. 
Section 18.10.106. - Reserved. 
Section 18.10.107. - Industrial and Commercial Records of Survey. 
Maps for industrial or commercial development, in accordance with NRS 278.325, shall be required to process all records of survey and pay all fees per this Chapter 18.10. 
(Ord. No. 3075, § 2, 4-11-83; Ord. No. 3361, § 1, 2-10-86) 
ARTICLE II: - APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR LAND DIVISION OR BOUNDARY LINE ADJUSTMENTS 
[1] 
(a)  This Article II states the application requirements for review of land division and boundary line adjustment applications. Additional requirements and procedures for the review and approval of these applications may be found in Nevada Revised Statutes, Chapter 278, Nevada Administrative Code Chapter 278, and Chapter 18.06. 
(b)  The purpose of Article II is to promote the public interest in careful land use planning before a land division or boundary line adjustment is approved. 
(c)  No individual, firm, association, corporation, or partnership, as principal or agent may, sell, or cause or permit to be sold any portion of any parcel of land subject to the requirements of this chapter prior to the recording of the final subdivision or parcel map in the office of the county recorder.

Section 18.10.401. - Purpose and Intent. 
(a)  In order to provide for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community, the city council establishes this article to regulate condominium housing, as follows: 
(1)  To ensure a reasonable balance of rental and ownership housing in the city and a variety of individual choices of tenure, type, price and location of housing; 
(2)  To maintain the adequate supply of rental housing for low and moderate-income persons and families; 
(3)  To reduce and ease the impact of displacement of long term residents, senior citizens, families with children, and those citizens who may be forced to move due to condominium conversion; 
(4)  To encourage the goal of owner occupied housing; 
(5)  To protect the great financial investment of citizens who purchase condominiums by requiring developers to disclose the necessary information upon which prospective condominium purchasers can base their decisions; 
(6)  To protect the lives, health, safety and possession of citizens who purchase condominiums. 
(b)  The city council recognizes that condominiums are a unique form of high population density property ownership and have their own attendant problems and advantages. Therefore, pursuant to NRS 117.110, it is the express purpose and intent of the city council to address and provide for the uniqueness of condominiums, and treat them differently from similar structures.

CHAPTER 18.12 - GENERAL DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN STANDARDS 
OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER 
Chapter 18.12 of Title 18 contains general development and design standards applicable to all development in the City of Reno, including subdivisions, regardless of the property's zoning district designation. The standards in this chapter cover a wide variety of subject areas, including bulk and dimensional standards (e.g., setbacks, lot area, lot width, building coverage, building height); protection of hillsides, wetlands, streams, drainageways, and mature trees; streets and vehicle access and circulation; off-street parking and loading; landscaping and screening; outdoor lighting; residential neighborhood protection; residential and nonresidential site and building design standards; utilities and services. 
Chapter 18.12's general development and design standards work together with the zoning district and use standards in Chapter 18.08, the subdivision standards in Chapter 18.10, the public improvement standards in Chapter 18.14, the sign standards in Chapter 18.16, and the historic preservation standards in Chapter 18.18 to comprise the substantive standards governing new development in the City of Reno. These standards are applied at all stages of the development review process, from subdivision, through zoning map amendment requests, and through review of special use permits and project site plans. Development in a Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zoning District or Specific Plan (SPD) Zoning District (Section 18.08.303) is also subject to the standards in this Chapter 18.12 unless otherwise modified through the PUD or SPD approval process. 
ARTICLE I: - BULK/DIMENSIONAL, DENSITY AND INTENSITY STANDARDS 

Section 18.12.101. - General Provisions. 
(a)  Related Zoning District or Use-Specific Regulations. Applicants for development should refer to Chapter 18.08 (Zoning) of this title for any applicable bulk/dimensional, density or intensity regulations specific to a particular base or overlay zoning district, or specific to a particular use. In case of conflict with the general development standards in this Article I, the more specific zoning district or use standard in Chapter 18.08 shall apply unless otherwise expressly stated. 
(b)  Dimensional Standards for Attached Single-Family, Condominiums, and Townhouse Units. Reduced lot sizes, reduced lot widths, and zero foot setbacks may be provided for attached single family, condominium, and townhouse units if: (1) common areas are maintained in a consistent manner by an association, master developer, or similar mechanism; (2) reciprocal parking and access agreements are recorded for use of the common areas; and (3) all other development standards are addressed and met by the larger project. This subsection may be utilized for residential and non-residential developments. 
(c)  Lot or Site Area Requirements-General Provisions.   
(1)  Minimum Standards/Calculation. No lot or parcel shall be so reduced in area as to be less in any dimension than is required by the zoning district in which the lot is located, unless a special use permit for cluster development has been approved. Calculation of minimum area requirements shall not include area devoted to access or roadway easements. 
(2)  Cluster Development. Cluster development may result in an increase of overall development density of no more than 15 percent over that which is otherwise permitted by the zoning district in which the lot or parcel is located, provided that the standards of Section 18.08.202(a)(1) are met. Clustering driven by the hillside slope density requirements in Article XVI (Hillside Development) of this chapter shall not qualify for a density bonus. 
(3)  Split Parcels. No portion of any parcel of land that is a part of the required area for an existing building shall be used as a part of the required area of any other parcel or proposed building. When a portion of any parcel is sold or transferred and the area of that portion or the portion remaining no longer conforms to the required area as defined in the zoning district in which the parcel is located, the portion sold or transferred and the portion remaining shall be considered as one parcel only in determining the permissible number and location of buildings allowed to be placed on both parcels. 
(4)  Reduction in Size.   
a.  No lot or parcel shall be reduced in area so as to be less in any dimension than is required by the requirements of the zoning district in which the lot or parcel is located. 
b.  Parcels created for public agencies and for utilities regulated by the Public Utilities Commission are exempt from this requirement. Upon cessation of the use, the parcel created for the public agency or utility shall be reverted to acreage or abandoned in accordance with Nevada law. Parcels previously created for this purpose shall be recognized under and subject to the provisions of this subsection. 
(Ord. No. 5189, § 1, 9-26-00; Ord. No. 5242, § 5, 5-22-01) 
(d)  Property Line Setbacks/Yards-General Provisions.   
(1)  Measurement. Required yard setbacks shall be measured from parcel boundaries. Where the parcel includes a private roadway that is not separately mapped, setbacks shall be measured from the edge of that roadway. 
a.  Exception for transit system and school bus shelters. The setback requirements of each zoning district shall not apply to public transit system, post office, or school bus shelters provided these shelters have first been approved by the administrator. Public transit system or school bus shelters may be placed within the public right-of-way if approved by the public works director. 
(2)  Self-Contained Yards. No required yard or open space around an existing building or any building hereafter erected shall be considered a yard or open space for any other building on an adjoining lot or parcel. 
(3)  Development Restrictions. Where yards are required by this chapter, all structures shall be prohibited, except as specified by this title. 
(4)  Intrusions into Yards. The following intrusions are permitted into a required yard setback: 
a.  Cornices, canopies, chimneys, eaves or other similar architectural features may extend into a required yard not to exceed two feet. 
b.  Outside stairs or landing places, if unroofed or unenclosed, may extend into required yards for a distance not to exceed three feet. 
(5)  Illustration of Required Yards. Figure 18.12-1 below illustrates a variety of lot types and indicates which are the front, rear and side yards. The administrator shall determine which are front, side or rear yards based on yard definitions for lot types not illustrated in Figure 18.12-1. 
  
(e)  Building Height-General Provisions. 
(1)  Exclusions from building height limits. Building height requirements of this chapter shall not apply to: 
a.  Church spires, belfries, cupolas, domes, chimneys, flues or flagpoles, or to water towers, radio towers, and the like, except where such may be deemed a hazard. 
b.  Parapet walls extending four (4) feet or less above the limiting height of the building on which they rest. 
c.  Bulkheads, elevator towers, one-story penthouses, water tanks or similar structures, provided that the aggregate floor area of such structures is not greater than one-half (1/2) of the total roof area. 
(2)  Building height review in vicinity of airports. New construction of, or expansion of existing structures to a height greater than 45 feet above ground level, on properties located within the FAR Part 77 Airspace map for the Reno-Tahoe International Airport (see Figure 18.08-12) or the Reno-Stead Airport (See Figure 18.08-13) shall be required to show documentation their plans have been submitted to the Reno-Tahoe Airport Authority, before plans will be approved or a building permit issued. 
(f)  Open Space. Each owner of a project which includes open space shall deed restrict the use of the property to preclude its future use for anything other than open space or recreational purposes. The deed restriction shall not be amended or the open space reduced or withdrawn from use as open space without the consent of the city council.

(a)  Building Articulation.   
(1)  Applicability. All facades on buildings constructed in a multi-family, office, or commercial zoning district (MF14, MF21, MF30, GO, PO. NC, AC, CC Districts), and any facade that faces an arterial road on a building in an industrial zoning district (I, IC, or IB Districts), shall meet the building articulation standards in this section (See Figure 18.12-3). 
(2)  Purpose. The purpose of these articulation standards is to discourage large blank building facades. 
(3)  Requirements. All facades subject to this subsection shall meet the following minimum standards for articulation, as illustrated in Figure 18.12-3. 
a.  Horizontal articulation. No plane of a building wall shall extend for a horizontal distance greater than two times the height of the wall without having an off-set of 15 percent of the wall's height, and that new wall plane shall extend for a distance equal to at least 25 percent of the maximum length of the first plane. In an industrial district, the wall may not extend greater than three times the height without having the off-set. 
b.  Vertical articulation. No wall shall extend for a horizontal distance greater than two times the height of the wall without changing height by a minimum of 15 percent of the wall's height. In an industrial district, the wall may not extend for a distance greater than three times the height of the wall without changing height by a minimum of 15 percent of the wall's height. 
c.  Exposed columns. Exposed structural support columns shall be constructed of, or clad in, the same material as the principal structure, unless the change in materials adds to the visual interest. 
(b)  Parking Garage Facades. The facades of parking garages shall be compatible with the architecture of buildings within the area in which the garage is located. See Figure 18.12-4. 
(c)  Shading of Parks and Residences.   
(1)  Residential Shading. Structures, which exceed 35 feet in height, shall not cast a shadow on residentially zoned property between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on December 21. 
(2)  Public Parks and Plaza Shading. No structure may cast a shadow on public parks or plazas between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on December 21.

(Ord. No. 5408, § 2, 12-10-02) 
(d)  Building Design Standards for Single-Family Development in Multi-Family Zoning Districts. Single-family development in multi-family zoning districts shall be subject to the single-family site and building design standards stated in this section, including without limitation the street image standards in subsection (e) below. 
(e)  Street Image Standards for New Single-Family Residential Structures.   
(1)  Applicability. This subsection's street image standards shall apply to all new single-family (detached and attached) residential structures in all zoning districts. 
(2)  Standard Street Image Features. Unless alternative street image plans are approved in accordance with subsections (3) or (4) below, new single-family residential structures on lots 70 feet or wider shall utilize a minimum of three of the following techniques, and new single-family residential structures on lots narrower than 70 feet shall utilize a minimum of two of the following techniques to reduce the prominence of garages, promote pedestrian activity, and create visual diversity in single-family neighborhoods: 
a.  House forward. Living areas shall extend a minimum of three feet in front of the garage face. See Figure 18.12-9. 
b.  Front porches. A 60 square foot or larger covered front porch shall be provided and shall extend a minimum of three feet in front of the living area. See Figure 18.12-6. 
c.  Courtyards. A 60 square foot or larger front yard courtyard with a hard finished floor surface (concrete, wood, brick, pavers, etc.) and walls not exceeding three feet in height shall be provided and shall extend a minimum of three feet in front of the garage face. 
  

  
d.  Varied front setbacks. Front setbacks of adjacent homes on the same side of the street shall vary by a minimum of three feet. See Figure 18.12-7. 
e.  Garage orientation. Garage doors shall not face the street (i.e., provide side loaded garages) and front elevations of garages shall be architecturally consistent with the living area front elevation. 
f.  Reduced garage width. Garages shall not exceed 40 percent of the front elevation. 
g.  Hillside adaptive architecture. Within hillside developments and on properties with an average slope exceeding ten percent, homes shall be built on existing grade. This option may be used if the development requires minor grading for driveways, rear yards and other features but may not be used in projects that mass grade sites to provide flat foundations and yards. See Figure 18.12-8. 
  
  
  
  
  
h.  Enhanced landscaping. On lots narrower than 70 feet, a minimum of one additional code size tree shall be provided in the front yard.

l.  Architectural modification. Custom designed homes shall be utilized or a minimum of eight model homes shall be available to customers. Minor facade, material and roof style modifications shall not qualify as separate models. 
(3)  Neotraditional Design. If vehicular access is provided exclusively from rear yard alleys, street image requirements shall be satisfied. To promote neotraditional development and compensate for the otherwise developable land that is used for alleys, minimum lot sizes and dimensions may be reduced by 20 percent, maximum lot coverage may be increased to 50 percent, and garage setbacks from alleys may be reduced to zero feet if access is provided from exclusively from alleys. 
(4)  Custom Street Image Plans. Custom street image plans may be approved by special use permit. In order to approve a special use permit for custom street image plans, the planning commission shall make the standard special use permit findings and an additional finding that the proposed street image plan meets the intent of reducing the prominence of garages, promoting pedestrian activity and creating visual diversity in single-family neighborhoods. 
(Ord. No. 5528, § 1, 12-17-03) 
  
  
Section 18.12.303. - Residential Infill Development Standards. 
(a)  Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to residential site development or redevelopment where the original subdivision is over 30 years old, and where a majority of property within 600 feet has been developed. 
(b)  Purpose. It is the general intent to have new structures placed on the site so as to recreate and/or maintain the typical setback pattern and architecture established in the neighborhood. 
(c)  Front Yard Setbacks. The front yard setback of any principal structure for new construction should be equal to that front yard setback of the existing structures on either side of the proposed building site. If the principal structures on each of the abutting sites have two different front yard setbacks, then the new principal structure shall be preferably set back at the same setback as the abutting principal structure that is closest to the street; and the maximum setback for the new principal structure shall not exceed the setback of the largest setback of the abutting existing structure. See Figure 18.12-10. 
  
(d)  Compatibility Findings. In reviewing a building permit, the following findings must be made: 
(1)  The proposed development fits within the established pattern of building height and setback for the area. 
(2)  At least one of the following: 
a.  The building and roof style conform to the established style in the area; or 
b.  There is no particular established building and roof style in the area; or 
c.  The proposed development represents a creative opportunity to improve or contribute to the quality of the neighborhood. 
(3)  The proposed development incorporates design features, architectural details, materials and building massing common to the area. 
(e)  Allowed Modifications. Variances shall not be required for modification of principal building setbacks if necessary to achieve compliance with this section. 
(Ord. No. 5189, § 1, 9-26-00; Ord. No. 5924, § 6, 5-9-07) 
Section 18.12.304. - Residential Adjacency Standards. 
(a)  Applicability and Exemptions.   
(1)  This Section 18.12.304 applies to all development in nonresidential, mixed use, and multi-family Zoning Districts that abuts single-family zoned property (including property in the SF4, SF6, SF9, SF15, LLR.5, LLR1, LLR2.5, GFSF, UT5, UT10, and UT40 Zoning Districts), or are separated from the single-family zoned property by only a right-of-way or easement. 
(2)  Section 18.12.304(g) "Noise at Residential Property Lines" shall apply to all development in nonresidential, mixed use and multi-family Zoning Districts that abuts any residentially zoned property (including property in the SF4, SF6, SF9, SF15, LLR.5, LLR1, LLR2.5, GFSF, UT5, UT10, UT40, MF-14, MF-21 and MF-30 Zoning Districts), or are separated from the residentially zoned property by only a right-of-way or easement. 
(3)  Development on sites over two acres that does not comply with subsection (d)(1)(b) below may be allowed by a special use permit. 
(b)  Building Facades. Developments adjacent to single-family zoned property shall be constructed such that the facade design, including roof lines and roof treatments, is consistent on all sides of the building. 
(c)  Signage adjacent to Residential.   
(1)  No advertising signage shall be permitted on the rear of any building when the rear of the building is adjacent to single-family zoned property. 
(2)  Internally illuminated wall signs are prohibited on the rear and sides of a building if the property abuts and the signs are visible from residentially zoned properties. 
(d)  Building Setbacks.   
(1)  Residential Slope. All buildings subject to this section's residential adjacency standards shall be setback from rear or side yard property lines adjoining single-family zoned properties according to the following formula: 
a.  Sites of two acres or less. The minimum side and/or rear yard setbacks shall be determined by utilizing a 1:1 height/setback ratio for that portion of any building which exceeds 15 feet in height. When the site adjoins single-family zoned property, the ten feet adjacent to the property line shall be landscaped. The additional setback shall be measured starting at the side or rear setback line. See Figure 18.12-11. 
b.  Sites over two acres. The minimum side and/or rear yard setbacks shall be determined by utilizing a 1:3 height/setback ratio for that portion of any building which exceeds 15 feet in height. When the site adjoins single-family zoned property, the ten feet adjacent to the property line shall be landscaped. The additional setback shall be measured starting at the side or rear setback line. See Figure 18.12-11. The 1:3 height/setback ratio may be reduced or eliminated subject to approval of a special use permit according to 18.06.405 of this title, as amended. 
c.  Notwithstanding the above, a building up to 15 feet in height may be constructed to the setback line established in (d)(2) below. 
(2)  Building Setback. In addition to the required building setback line, no building setback shall be less than the building setback for the property zoned single-family where they share common boundaries, or where they are separated by an alley or utility easement. 
  
(e)  Spillover Lighting.   
(1)  Lighting Standard. Lighting from a nonresidential property shall not create greater than 0.50 foot candle of spillover light at a single-family zoned residential property line. 
(2)  Redirecting/Screening of Light Sources. All sources of light, including security lighting, illuminated signs, vehicular headlights and other sources, shall be directed away from single-family zoned residential property or screened so that the light level stated in (e)(1) above is not exceeded. 
(3)  Lighting Near Residential Areas. Light fixtures and standards in or within 100 feet of any single-family residential zoning district shall not exceed 20 feet in height. The administrator may permit additional height provided such lights are a sharp cut-off lighting system. 
(f)  Exclusions for Higher Ambient Noise and Light Levels. Where existing ambient noise and light levels already exceed the standards as of the effective date of this section, the subject source may not increase existing levels. 
(g)  Noise at Residential Property Lines.   
(1)  Measurement. Measurement of noise shall be made at the residential property line with a sound level meter and octave band analyzer meeting the standards prescribed by the American Standards Association. 
(2)  Permissible Noise Level.   
a.  Nighttime noise level. Noise levels shall not exceed 49 db leq or 49 db for a single event occurring on a re-occurring basis at a residentially zoned property line between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. 
b.  Daytime noise level. Noise levels shall not exceed 65 db leq or 65 db for a single event on a reoccurring basis at a residentially zoned property line.

(i)  Use of Alleys. Commercial truck and automobile traffic shall be prohibited on alleys that are shared with single-family zoned residential properties between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. This includes, but is not limited to, deliveries, and commercial parking lot access. Garbage collection may occur during these hours. 
(j)  Landscaping and Screening. Landscaping and Screening shall conform to Article XII (Landscape and Screening Standards). 
(Ord. No. 5189, § 1, 9-26-00; Ord. No. 5821, § 1, 4-5-06; Ord. No. 5927, § 1, 5-23-07; Ord. No. 6286, § 1, 3-13-13) 
Section 18.12.305. - Nonresidential and Mixed Use Site and Building Design Standards. 
(a)  Nonresidential Site Design Standards.   
(1)  Play Structures. Exterior play structures associated with commercial activities in all nonresidential and mixed use zoning districts shall not be placed between the primary building and any adjacent road right-of-way. Child care centers/ facilities shall be exempt from this standard. 
(2)  Industrial Sites. The following standards shall apply to all new development in the I, IB and IC Zoning Districts: 
a.  All activities on-site. Buildings and structures shall be designed and placed upon the property so that the loading and unloading of materials or supplies shall be entirely within the property lines of the lot. 
b.  Loading and service areas. Loading docks, truck loading, storage, and refuse areas, platforms, and other such areas shall be located on the side(s) or rear of buildings where possible. Site design considerations should include the location of refuse disposal facilities so that they will be adequately screened from public view. Such facilities should be located to minimize noise and odor impacts on residential properties. Where docks and other service areas face the street, they should be obscured from view with landscape planting, walls, fences, grade changes, or a combination of these techniques. See Sections 18.12.1207 and 18.12.1208 for applicable service area screening requirements. 
c.  Use of public streets. The use of the public street for parking and staging of trucks awaiting loading shall be prohibited. The site must accommodate all maneuvers necessary by trucks (no backing from street). 
d.  Integration of utilities. Pad-mounted transformers and other utility services shall be integrated into the site plan wherever possible. The necessity for utility connections, meter boxes, or other such facilities, should be recognized and integrated within the architectural design of the buildings. 
e.  Integration of architecture, signage and lighting. Buildings shall be considered as an integrated whole, including signage, addressing, and lighting. Exterior interest shall be provided on all street frontage elevations by breaking the architectural plane or by using material textures, colors, shadow elements, or landscaping. The exterior treatment of the building shall integrate the use of these elements on every side of the building, which is visible from a street. See Section 18.12.301 for applicable building articulation standards in the industrial zoning districts. 
f.  Review by administrator. The design standards above are subject to review and modification by the administrator for restrictions imposed upon a site due to physical constraints, or for conditions where existing facilities are being expanded and enforcement of these criteria would impose a hardship upon the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 5189, § 1, 9-26-00; Ord. No. 5242, § 7, 5-22-01; Ord. No. 5473, § 1, 7-16-03) 
(b)  Nonresidential Building Design Standards.   
(1)  Pad Sites. Structures constructed on pad sites within a shopping center development shall be architecturally compatible with the main structures within the shopping center. 
(2)  Architectural Character in the PO and NC Districts. In established areas, new construction shall be consistent in scale and architecturally compatible with other principal structures in the area. 
(3)  Blank Walls in the MU District. To avoid a monotonous pedestrian environment, blank walls at pedestrian level are prohibited. At least 50 percent of the width of a new or reconstructed first story building wall facing a street shall be devoted to pedestrian entrances, display window or windows affording views into retail, office, restaurant, or lobby space. 
(c)  Mixed Use District Site and Building Design Standards. See Chapter 18.08, Section 18.08.302(a), for site and building design standards and other district-specific development standards applicable in the Mixed Use (MU) Zoning District. 
(Ord. No. 5189, § 1, 9-26-00; Ord. No. 5242, § 7, 5-22-01; Ord. No. 5473, § 1, 7-16-03; Ord. No. 5821, § 1, 4-5-06) 
Section 18.12.306. - Design Standards for Large Retail Establishments. 
(a)  Purpose. Large retail establishments depend on high visibility from major public streets, a large physical scale, and a high volume of use by many residents and visitors. As a consequence, design of large retail establishments determines much of the character, function, and image of this community and its streetscapes and commercial areas. The purpose of this section is to encourage large retail establishments and commercial center developments containing large retail establishments, to contribute to Reno as a unique place and to physically integrate with the community in a positive way. The standards of this section supplement existing basic standards for development found elsewhere in this chapter. These large scale retail establishment design standards promote a basic level of architectural variety and interest, a compatible appearance and scale, pedestrian and parking lot access, orientation of buildings and entrances in relation to surrounding streets, and mitigation of negative impacts from development of large retail establishments. 
(b)  Applicability and Exemptions.   
(1)  The standards of this Section 18.12.306 shall apply to the following: 
a.  New construction of a large retail establishment; 
b.  Expansion of or addition to an existing building that creates a large retail establishment; or 
c.  [Reserved.] 
(c)  Relationship to Other Standards. The provisions of this section shall apply in addition to the generally applicable development and design standards found elsewhere in this chapter and title. Where there is a conflict with generally applicable standards in this chapter or title, the more specific standards of this section shall apply. Where there is a conflict with standards stated in an overlay zoning district, such as one of the regional center overlay zone districts found in Section 18.08.405, the standards for large retail establishments stated in this section shall apply and control unless otherwise expressly stated. 
(d)  Minimum Land Use Mix Required. All new large retail establishments shall be located in a commercial center that includes more than four (4) commercial sales and service uses. Such commercial center shall be planned, developed, and owned or managed as a single unit and shall provide off-street parking on the property. 
(e)  Adaptability for Reuse and Prohibition of Restrictive Lease Agreements. This subsection's standards are intended to mitigate some of the adverse community effects when large retail establishments vacate their buildings and commercial centers. Many national retailers often abandon older outlets for new formats in new locations, rather than reuse and redevelop existing buildings and centers. Vacant, large-format buildings tend to remain empty for many years, causing blight and eroding nearby property values. Retailers often hang on to these empty buildings or, in the case of leased sites, continue to pay rent, in order to prevent their competitors from occupying the locations. Accordingly, these standards require new large retail establishment structures to be built with adaptable interior configurations for future reuse by multiple, smaller tenants, and to prevent large retailers from blocking competition after vacating a building through restrictive lease terms or covenants. 
(1)  The design of all buildings housing a large retail establishment shall include specific elements for adaptation for future multi-tenant reuse. Such elements may include but are not limited to compartmentalized construction, including plumbing, electrical service, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. The building design shall also allow for: 
a.  The interior subdivision of the structure into separate tenancies; 
b.  Facades that readily adapt to multiple entrances and adapt to entrances on all but one side of the building; 
c.  Parking lot schemes that are shared by establishments or are linked by safe and functional pedestrian connections; 
d.  Landscaping schemes that compliment the multiple entrance design; and 
e.  Other elements of design that facilitate the multi-tenant reuse of the building. 
(2)  All development applications subject to this subsection (e) shall include a renewal plan that evidences specific compliance with this subsection's adaptability for reuse standards, and otherwise evidences the feasibility of the building's rehabilitation or redevelopment in the event of closure or relocation by the original occupant. 
(3)  When a commercial center development includes a large retail establishment, a landlord shall not enter into a lease agreement or other contract that prevents the landlord from marketing and renting to future lessees after a large retail establishment has vacated the development. After a large retail establishment vacates a commercial center, the landlord shall be free to market to any person or company allowed by City of Reno codes. 
(f)  [Reserved.]   
(g)  Building Design and Architecture. All development subject to this Section shall comply with the following standards: 
(1)  Facade Articulation and Features.   
a.  Intent. Facade articulations and detailed elements should be employed to reduce the apparent bulk, industrial look, and uniform appearances of large buildings, provide visual interest and variety, and respect and reinforce the human scale. 
b.  Minimum wall articulation.   
  


Figure 18.12-11.1: Any building wall greater than 100 feet in length shall include changes in wall plane, changes in texture, windows, trellises with vines, changes in color, or an equivalent element that subdivides the wall into human-scale proportions.
1.  Any building wall greater than one hundred (100) feet in length, measured horizontally, that faces a street or connecting pedestrian walkway shall include at least three (3) of the following features within each successive thirty (30) foot section or part thereof: 
i.  Change in wall plane, such as projections or recesses, having a depth of at least three (3) percent of the length of the facade and extending at least twenty (20) percent of the length of the facade; 
ii.  Change in texture or masonry pattern; 
iii.  Change in color; 
iv.  Windows; 
v.  Trellises with vines; or 
vi.  An equivalent element that subdivides the wall into human scale proportions. 
See Figures 18.12-11.1 and 18.12-11.2. 
2.  Ground floor building facades that face public streets shall have arcades, display windows, entry areas, awnings, or other such features along at least sixty (60) percent of their horizontal length. See Figure 18.12-11.3. 
  


Figure 18.12-11.2: An effective way to articulate the facade of a large retail building is to include a change in wall plane, such as projections or recesses, having a depth of at least three (3) percent of the length of the facade and extending at least twenty (20) percent of the length of the facade.
3.  All sides of the building shall include articulation, materials, and design characteristics consistent with those on the primary front facade in terms of quality and detail, unless the public's view of a rear or side building elevation from a public street or from an adjacent residentially zoned property is blocked by intervening buildings, topography, or other similar feature. See Figure 18.12-11.4. 
4.  If actual doors and windows are not feasible on side or rear walls that face walkways because of the nature of the use of the building facade, then such walls shall include false windows, either glazing or pattern, and defined by frames, sills, and lintels, or similarly-proportioned modulations of the wall. 
(2)  Transparency.   
a.  Intent. The use of transparent building materials (e.g., glass) is intended to provide a pedestrian-friendly environment at the ground floor level, and to enhance pedestrian safety wherever possible by allowing visibility of parking areas and on-site walkways from building interiors. 
b.  Minimum transparency requirements. All buildings subject to this Section shall comply with the following minimum transparency standards: 
  


Figure 18.12-11.3: Ground floor facades facing public streets must be articulated to provide pedestrian interest, including provision of arcades, display windows, awnings, entry areas or other similar features along at least 60% of the facade's horizontal length.
  


Figure 18.12-11.4: Side or rear walls that face walkways may include false windows and door openings defined by frames, sills, and lintels, or similarly proportioned modulations of the wall.
1.  A minimum of sixty (60) percent of any ground floor facade between two (2) feet and ten (10) feet above grade fronting on a public street or containing a principal customer entrance shall be comprised of windows for window shopping, with views into interior areas for merchandise display, shopping, and/or other customer services. A minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of ground floor facades that face parking lots shall also be comprised of windows. 
2.  If actual doors and windows are not feasible on side or rear walls that face walkways because of the nature of the use of the building facade, such walls shall include false windows, either glazing or pattern, and defined by frames, sills, and lintels, or similarly-proportioned modulations of the wall. See Figure 18.12-11.4. 
c.  Small retail stores located inside or attached to large retail establishments. When a building containing a large retail establishment also contains separately owned commercial establishments with separate customer entrances that occupy less than twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet of gross floor area, the following minimum transparency standards shall apply instead of the general standards in subsection (2)b. above: 
1.  The street level facade of stores shall be transparent between the height of three (3) feet and eight (8) feet above walkway grade for no less than sixty (60) percent of the horizontal length of the building facade. 
(3)  Roof Form and Articulation.   
  


Figure 18.12-11.5: Parapet design for concealing flat roofs and roof-top equipment.
a.  Intent. To pronounce and vary roof lines and heights to present a distinctive profile, add interest to and reduce the massive scale of large buildings, and complement the character of adjoining neighborhoods. 
b.  Screening of roof-top equipment. The building parapet shall be the primary means of screening roof-top equipment. All roof-top equipment shall be screened according to Section 18.12.1208. 
c.  Roof design and treatment. Roofs shall have no less than two (2) of the following features: 
1.  Three (3) or more roof slope planes. 
2.  Parapets concealing flat roofs and roof-top equipment such as HVAC units from public view. The average height of such parapets shall not exceed fifteen (15) percent of the height of the supporting wall and such parapets shall not at any point exceed one-third ( 1/3 ) of the height of the supporting wall. Such parapets shall feature three dimensional cornice treatment (See Figure 18.12-11.5); 
3.  Overhanging eaves, extending no less than three (3) feet past the supporting walls; or 
4.  Sloping roofs that do not exceed the average height of the supporting walls, with an average slope greater than or equal to one (1) foot of vertical rise for every three (3) feet of horizontal run and less than or equal to one (1) foot of vertical rise for every one (1) foot of horizontal run. 
d.  Consistent roof treatment. Consistent roof treatment shall be provided on all sides of the building. 
e.  Visible back sides finished. The back sides of all cornices, parapets, and rooflines that are visible from an adjacent residential zone district or from a public street shall be finished. 
(4)  Customer Entrances.   
a.  Intent. To emphasize major entrances into buildings, to ensure that entryway design provides orientation and an attractive appearance to the building, to provide multiple entrances to reduce walking distances, facilitate pedestrian access, and to improve the relationship of the large retail establishments to the surrounding community. 
b.  Number of entrances required.   
1.  Buildings containing large retail establishments with one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of gross floor area or more shall feature customer entrances on at least two (2) sides of the building. The two required sides shall be those planned to have the highest level of public pedestrian activity. 
2.  When additional commercial establishments under separate ownership are located in the same primary building as a large retail establishment, each such establishment shall have an exterior customer entrance that complies with the visually prominent entrance requirement below, except that such entrance shall include a minimum of two (2) visual prominence features listed in subsection (4)d. below. Restaurants containing less than two thousand (2,000) square feet of gross floor area are excluded from this requirement for an exterior customer entrance, except that if such an entrance is provided, the entrance shall comply with the visually prominent entrance requirements below. 
c.  Orientation. The primary entrance to a large retail establishment shall face the primary street adjacent to the site. The primary street will typically be the street with the highest level of vehicular and pedestrian activity. 
  


Figure 18.12-11.6: Buildings shall have clearly-defined, highly-visible customer entrances.
d.  Visual prominence. In order to provide clearly defined and highly visible entrances, all building and store fronts subject to subsection (f)(4)'s building design and architecture standards shall have customer entrances featuring no less than three (3) of the following (See Figure 18.12-11.6): 
1.  Canopies, arcades or porticos that, while satisfying weather protection requirements of subsection (4) f, also lend visual prominence to the entrance; 
2.  Overhangs, recesses or projections; 
3.  Raised corniced parapets over the door; 
4.  Peaked roof forms; 
5.  Tower features integrated with the building design that extend above the building roof line; 
6.  Arches; 
7.  Outdoor patios; 
8.  Display windows; 
9.  Integral planters or wing walls; 
10.  Entrance atriums with visual connections to outside. 
e.  Transparency and light. The principal customer entrance to any building shall feature at least two elements from the following:

4.  Ornamental light fixtures. 
f.  Weather protection. Canopies, arcades, or similar permanent sheltering roof structures shall provide weather protection along facades of buildings to pedestrians at customer entrances, taxi and drop off zones, valet parking, and bicycle parking. Weather protection means, for purposes of this provision, a permanent shelter or covering of sufficient length and width to provide protection to pedestrians from sun, wind, rain, or snow. 
(5)  Building Materials and Colors.   
  


Figure 18.12-11.7: All primary buildings shall be constructed or clad with materials that are durable and of a quality that will retain their appearance over time.
a.  Intent. To specify building materials that are durable, attractive, and have low maintenance requirements; and reduce the use of bright, intense colors. 
b.  Building materials.   
1.  All primary buildings shall be constructed or clad with materials that are durable and of a quality that will retain their appearance over time, including, but not limited to, natural or synthetic stone; brick; stucco; integrally-colored, textured, or glazed concrete masonry units; high-quality prestressed concrete systems; Exterior Installation Finish Systems (EIFS); or glass. See Figure 18.12-11.7. 
2.  The following exterior building materials are prohibited: 
i.  Vinyl siding; 
ii.  Field-painted or pre-finished standard corrugated metal siding; or 
iii.  Smooth-faced gray concrete block, painted or stained concrete block, tilt-up concrete panels. These materials may be used as main framing materials with an exterior treatment or finish that replicates materials specified in subsection 1 above. 
3.  Exterior building material shall be continued down to within nine (9) inches of finished grade on any elevation. 
c.  Building color.   
1.  Color schemes shall aesthetically integrate building elements together, relate separate (free-standing) buildings within the same commercial center development to each other, and shall be used to enhance the architectural form of a building. 
2.  All building projections, including, but not limited to, chimneys, flues, vents, and gutters, shall match or complement in color the permanent color of the surface from which they project. 
3.  Intense, bright, black, or fluorescent colors shall be used sparingly and only as accents; such colors shall not be used as the predominant color on any wall or roof of any building. Permitted signs shall be excluded from this standard. 
4.  Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors, including primary colors; however, neon tubing shall only be an acceptable trim near customer entrances. 
(6)  Architectural Unity.   
a.  Intent. To provide a unified, coherent, and aesthetically pleasing design and theme within a commercial center that contains multiple buildings. 
b.  Architectural unity required. All buildings within the same commercial center shall be architecturally unified. Architectural unity means that buildings shall be related and compatible in style, color scheme, and quality and type of exterior building materials. 
(h)  Site Design and Relationship to Surrounding Community.   
(1)  Location and Design of Parking Lots.   
a.  Intent. Large parking areas should be divided into smaller lots and distributed around buildings in order to provide safe and convenient access, shorten the distance between primary buildings and public streets, and break up the massive scale of large paved surfaces. If buildings containing large retail establishments are located closer to streets, then the scale is reduced, pedestrian traffic is encouraged, and architectural details of the building take on added importance. 
b.  Defining the "front parking quadrant" for large retail establishments.   
1.  These regulations encourage limiting the number of surface off-street parking spaces located between the front door of a large retail establishment and the primary, abutting street. This is achieved by controlling the amount of parking located within a building's "Front Parking Quadrant." The applicant must designate the "Front Parking Quadrant" on all proposed development and site plans. 
2.  The "Front Parking Quadrant" is defined by connecting each of the four corners of the building containing a large retail establishment to the closest property line. This exercise will create four quadrants. The one quadrant located between the building's front door and the primary abutting street is the "Front Parking Quadrant." See Figure 18.12-11.8 below. 
3.  Parking spaces in the Front Parking Quadrant shall be counted to include all parking spaces falling within the boundaries of the Front Parking Quadrant, including all partial parking spaces if the part inside the Front Parking Quadrant boundary lines constitutes more than one-half (1/2) of such parking space. 
  

Figure 18.12-11.8: "Front Parking Quadrant"

c.  Location of parking.   
  

Figure 18.12-11.9: Location of Parking

In order to reduce the scale of the paved surfaces and to shorten the walking distance between parked cars and a building containing a large retail establishment, the Front Parking Quadrant shall contain no more than fifty (50) percent of the off-street surface parking spaces provided for all uses located in the building containing a large retail establishment. See Figures 18.12-11.9 and 18.12-11.10. Note that in instances when the building housing a large retail establishment is sited on a side or rear setback line, it may be impossible to site any off-street parking spaces in the "quadrant" adjoining the side or rear setback line. 
d.  Parking blocks required. In order to reduce the scale of parking areas, all surface parking areas shall be broken up into smaller parking blocks containing no more than forty (40) spaces: 
1.  Parking blocks shall be separated from each other by a minimum five (5) foot wide landscaping strip, access drives or public streets, pedestrian walkways, or buildings. 
  

Figure 18.12-11.10: The intent is to break up massive scale of large paved surfaces into smaller lots, distribute them around large retail buildings, and still provide safe and convenient access.
  

Figure 18.12-11.11: Public Sidewalks

2.  Each parking block shall have consistent design angles for all parking within the block. 
3.  Parking blocks shall be oriented to buildings to allow pedestrian movement down and not across rows (typically with parking drive aisles perpendicular to customer entrances). 
(2)  Pedestrian Connections (Pedestrian Access and Circulation). Applicants shall submit a detailed pedestrian circulation plan with all development applications that shows compliance with the following standards: 
a.  Public sidewalks. Sidewalks at least six (6) feet wide shall be provided along all sides of the parcel or lot that abut a public street. The sidewalk shall be separated from the street curb by a landscaped parkway at least eight (8) feet wide; or the required front yard setback, whichever is greater. The parkway landscaping shall be in addition to the landscaping required around the perimeter of the parking lot (see Section 18.12.1205(e)). See Section 18.12.1205 for applicable street tree requirements. See Figure 18.12-11.11. 
b.  Required pedestrian connections. An on-site system of pedestrian walkways shall be designed to provide direct access and connection to and between the following (See Figure 18.12-11.12): 
  


Figure 18.12-11.12: On-site pedestrian walkways shall connect each primary entrance of a commercial building to the adjacent parking blocks, structures, or site amenities.
1.  The primary entrance or entrances to each building in a commercial center development, including free-standing (pad) buildings; 
2.  Any sidewalks or walkways on adjacent properties that extend to the boundaries shared with the commercial center development; 
3.  Any public sidewalk system along the perimeter streets adjacent to the commercial center development; 
4.  Where practicable and appropriate, adjacent land uses and developments; and 
5.  Where practicable and appropriate, any adjacent public park, greenway, or other public or civic use including but not limited to schools, places of worship, public recreational facilities, or government offices. 
c.  Pedestrian connections from primary entrances to parking areas and site amenities. In addition to the connections required above, on-site pedestrian walkways shall connect each primary entrance of a commercial building to a pedestrian network serving (See Figure 18.12-11.13): 
  


Figure 18.12-11.13: A clear, on-site system of pedestrian walkways shall be provided.
1.  All parking blocks, parking areas, or parking structures that serve such primary building; and 
2.  Site amenities or gathering places provided pursuant to Section 18.12.306(g)(3). 
d.  Pedestrian connection to perimeter public sidewalks. Connections between the on-site (internal) pedestrian walkway network and any public sidewalk system located along adjacent perimeter streets shall be provided at regular intervals along the perimeter street as appropriate to provide easy access from the public sidewalk to the interior walkway network. At a minimum, "regular interval" shall mean mid-block or one connection for every four hundred (400) feet of perimeter public sidewalk length, whichever distance is shorter. See Figure 18.12-11.14. 
  

Figure 18.12-11.14: Continuous Pedestrian Walkways Shall Provide Internal and External Connections, and Shall Provide Safe, Dedicated Pedestrian Travel Ways Separate From Vehicle Traffic
e.  Walkways along primary buildings. Continuous pedestrian walkways shall be provided along the full length of a primary building along any facade featuring a customer entrance and along any facade abutting customer parking areas. Such walkways shall be located at least six (6) feet from the facade of the building to provide planting beds for foundation landscaping, except where features such as arcades or entryways are part of the facade. As an alternative to the six-foot planting bed, tree grates with decorative paving may be utilized along fifty (50) percent of the facade. For all options, a minimum eight (8) foot unobstructed pathway shall be maintained on the pedestrian walkway. 
f.  Minimum walkway width. All site walkways connecting parking areas to buildings shall have a minimum, unobstructed width of six (6) feet. In addition, planting areas, including trees, shrubs, benches, flower beds, ground cover, and other such materials, shall be installed along no less than fifty (50) percent of the entire length of the walkway. Where landscaping is provided along the walkway, the combined minimum width of the walkway plus the landscape area shall be fifteen (15) feet to accommodate car overhangs. See Figure 18.12-11.15. 
  

Figure 18.12-11.15: Internal Walkways

g.  Walkway materials.   
1.  All internal pedestrian walkways shall be distinguished from driving surfaces through the use of durable, low maintenance surface materials such as pavers, bricks, or scored and tinted concrete to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort, as well as the attractiveness of the walkways. At each point that the on-site pedestrian walkway system crosses a parking lot or internal street or driveway, the walkway or crosswalk shall be clearly marked through the use of a change in paving materials distinguished by their color, texture, or height. Surface striping with paint shall not be considered "a change in paving materials." 
2.  The total surface area of all on-site pedestrian walkways that incorporate quality paving materials such as pavers, bricks, or scored and tinted concrete may be credited toward the minimum twenty-five (25) percent hardscape limit for on-site landscaping stated in Section 18.12.1205 of this title. 
(3)  Site Amenities.   
a.  Intent. Site amenities and pedestrian-scale features (e.g., outdoor plazas, street furniture, playgrounds, statuary, sidewalk cafes) in commercial center developments offer attractive spaces for customer and visitor interaction and create an inviting image for both customers and employees. Site amenities and gathering places can vary widely in size, type, and location. The use of site amenities can provide pedestrian spaces at the entry to buildings, can break up expanses of parking, enhance the overall development quality, and contribute to the character of an area. Buildings, trees, walls, topography, and other site features within a commercial center that includes a large retail establishment should be oriented and arranged to enclose such gathering places and lend a human scale. 
b.  Standards for site amenities.   
  


Figure 18.12-11.16: This illustration of a plaza within a commercial development provides a public gathering and a significant site amenity.
1.  Minimum area devoted to site amenities. All development subject to this Section's design standards shall provide a minimum of ten (10) square feet of site amenities, open areas, and public gathering places for each ten (10) parking spaces provided. 
2.  Allowed site amenities. Site amenities shall consist of at least two (2) of the following: 
i.  Patio or plaza with seating area (See Figure 18.12-11.16); 
ii.  Mini-parks, squares, or greens; 
iii.  Bus stops in coordination with the regional transit agency; 
iv.  Customer walkways or pass-throughs containing window displays; 
v.  Water feature; 
vi.  Clock tower; and/or 
vii.  Public art; 
viii.  Any other similar, deliberately-shaped area and/or focal feature that, in the city's judgment, adequately enhances such development and serves as a gathering place. 
3.  Aggregation allowed. In commercial center developments containing more than one building, the required area may be aggregated into one larger space, provided such space is within easy walking distance of the large retail establishment and other major tenants in the center. 
4.  Design requirements. All site amenities within a commercial development shall be an integral part of the overall design and within easy walking distance of major buildings, major tenants, and any transit stops. 
i.  Any such amenity/area shall have direct access to the public sidewalk network. 
ii.  The amenity/area shall be constructed of materials that are similar in quality to the principal materials of the primary buildings and landscape. 
(4)  Side and rear setbacks/screening.   
a.  Intent. The setback and screening standards are intended to mitigate the potential adverse noise, light/glare, and visual impacts associated with large retail establishments and other large scale commercial development. 
b.  Minimum setback and screening standards. The minimum rear or side yard setback for any building containing a large scale retail establishment shall be thirty-five (35) feet from the nearest property line. Where such building facade also faces an abutting residentially zoned property, either a six (6) foot high decorative masonry wall or an earthen berm no less than six (6) feet high shall be provided, in addition to a twenty (20) foot wide landscape buffer containing at a minimum evergreen trees planted at intervals of twenty (20) feet on center or in clusters.

(a)  Enabling Clause. The Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP) has issued a discharge permit to Reno, Sparks, Washoe County, and Nevada Department of Transportation requiring the development, implementation and enforcement of a regional storm water quality management program. The storm water discharge permit is a component of a national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) established by the Clean Water Act Amendments of 1987. An element of the storm water quality management program is the reduction of pollution from construction sites to the maximum extent practicable in accordance with the NPDES permit issued by NDEP. 
(Ord. No. 5466, § 1, 6-25-03) 
(b)  Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to: 
(1)  Promote and protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Reno and enhance and preserve the quality and value of our resources by regulating construction activities. 
(2)  Provide for the protection of storm water, ground water, water bodies, watercourses, and wetlands pursuant to and consistent with the Clean Water Act, and NPDES permit granted to the City of Reno. 
(3)  Manage and control the amount of pollutants in storm water discharges, soil erosion, sediment discharge, mud and dirt deposits on public roadways, and municipal storm sewer systems caused by or a result of construction activities. 
(4)  Ensure adequate drainage, storm water management, and soil conservation measures are utilized at the site of any construction activity. 
(Ord. No. 5466, § 1, 6-25-03) 
(c)  Applicability. Off-site impacts of erosion and sedimentation from a construction site are prohibited and polluting substances such as construction materials and wastes shall be contained on the site where they cannot drain or be transported by storm water into a water body, channel or storm drain. Best Management Practices shall be implemented for all construction sites and are mandated for construction sites with a disturbed area of one acre or greater or one acre or less if in a sensitive area or part of a larger planned development according to the performance standards of the "Truckee Meadows Construction Site Best Management Practices Handbook" ("BMP Manual") together with such addendum, all of which are on deposit in the office of the City Clerk, are adopted by reference and incorporated here in and made a part hereof as if set forth in full. 
(Ord. No. 5466, § 1, 6-25-03) 
(d)  Regulatory Consistency. This section shall be construed to assure consistency with state and federal laws, rules and regulations, including the Clean Water Act and all acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto; all NPDES permits issued to the City of Reno; and any other provisions of the Reno Municipal Code. No permit or approval issued pursuant to this section shall relieve a person of the responsibility to secure permits and approvals required for activities regulated by any other applicable rule, code, act, permit or ordinance. Compliance with this section does not exempt any person from complying with other applicable ordinances, rules, codes, acts, or permits. 
(Ord. No. 5466, § 1, 6-25-03) 
(e)  Construction Site Discharge Regulations and Requirements.   
(1)  Construction permit submittal is required on all projects that may require a grading, site development, building, site drainage, or encroachment permits and will disturb one or more acres of land (including public works projects). 
(2)  Prior to the issuance of a construction permit, the following must be submitted:

Section 18.12.405. - Post Construction Storm Water Quality Management. 
(a)  Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to: 
(1)  Prevent threats to public health and safety by regulating storm water runoff discharges from applicable land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, flooding, stream channel erosion, and non-point source pollution associated with storm water runoff. 
(2)  Control and minimize the above impacts through implementation of approved post construction storm water quality management plans that place a strong emphasis on implementing Low Impact Development (LID) principles and techniques that include, but are not limited to disturbing only the smallest area necessary, minimizing soil compaction and imperviousness in drainage and recharge areas, preserving natural drainages, vegetation, and buffer zones, and utilizing on-site storm water treatment techniques to the maximum extent practicable. 
(b)  Applicability.   
(1)  Approved post construction storm water quality management plans and storm water treatment device access and maintenance agreements are required for the following development activities unless waived according to the terms outlined in subsection (e) entitled "Waivers to Applicability": 
a.  Any new development involving the following: 
i.  Building permits. Special use permits and site plan reviews that would create a new industrial, commercial, or civic structures; 
ii.  Any new development that would specifically enable outdoor material storage; outdoor material loading/unloading; fueling areas; outdoor work, maintenance and wash areas; spill prevention, containment and cleanup; waste handling and disposal uses; any industrial use that has been assigned a Federal North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code; and uses defined as industrial within Title 18; 
iii.  Final plat and parcel maps which require improvement plans on one (1) or more acres of land; 
iv.  Grading and site permits involving one or more acres of land except for individual single family homes; 
v.  Development activities defined in subsections (b)(1)a iii and (b)(1)a iv (above) that are smaller than one acre if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules; 
vi.  Development that will include constructed open channels and local or regional detention basins for flood management; 
vii.  Development that will disturb less than one acre of land that will also be located within or directly adjacent to environmentally sensitive areas, as defined in the Truckee Meadows Low Impact Development Manual. 
(2)  Complete applications for applicable development permits and entitlements that have been submitted before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section are exempt from the requirements of this section. 
(3)  Permits and entitlements that were issued before the effective date of this section shall not be subject to this section as long as the accompanying permit is valid. 
(4)  Permits and entitlements for individual single family homes and tenant improvements that do not require expansion of the site shall not be subject to this section. 
(c)  Application Requirements.   
(1)  No applicable permit shall be issued until the post construction storm water quality management plan (as described in subsection (d) "Standards") and storm water treatment device access and maintenance agreement are approved by the community development department. 
(2)  Applications meeting the terms of subsection (b) "Applicability" must be accompanied by the following documents in order for the application to be considered complete: two copies of the post construction storm water quality management plan and two copies of the storm water treatment device access and maintenance agreement.

(3)  Appeals of post construction storm water quality management plan disapprovals for building permits shall follow in accordance with the provisions of Section 18.06.208 and all other appeals shall be filed with the relevant provisions of this Title 18. 
(d)  Standards.   
(1)  Post construction storm water quality management plan required for all applicable developments. A post construction storm water quality management plan shall be prepared by a professional civil engineer, registered in the State of Nevada and prepared using the "Truckee Meadows Structural Controls Design and Low Impact Development Manual" and the "Public Works Design Manual", together with all addendum, as planning and design guidance for the implementation of the post construction storm water quality management requirements described in this section. Storm water quality management plan standards are described in the "Public Works Design Manual." These documents are on deposit with the office of the City Clerk. 
(e)  Waivers to Applicability.   
(1)  Every applicant shall provide for storm water quality management as required by this section, unless a written request to waive the plan requirements is granted by the administrator. 
(2)  Standards for Waivers. Because there may be circumstances when the post construction storm water quality treatment measures described in this section are inappropriate to meet the purpose and intent of this section, the minimum requirements for a post construction storm water quality management plan may be waived provided that at least one of the following conditions applies to the satisfaction of the administrator: 
a.  The proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the purpose and intent of this section, or the site conditions are such that of the purpose and intent of this section are unattainable; or 
b.  Provisions are made to manage storm water quality by an off-site facility, 
i.  An off-site facility is defined as a storm water management measure located outside the subject property boundary described in the permit application for land development activity; and 
ii.  The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of storm water treatment and control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices, and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the storm water practice; 
(f)  Performance Bond/Security.   
(1)  The developer shall submit a performance security or bond prior to issuance of a permit requiring post construction storm water quality management in order to ensure that the storm water practices are installed by the permit holder as required by the approved storm water management plan. The amount of the installation performance security shall be the total estimated construction cost of the storm water management practices approved under the permit, plus 20 percent. The performance bond/security can be a stand alone instrument, or may be combined with other required performance securities. The performance security shall be forfeited for failure to complete work specified in the storm water management plan. 
The performance security shall be released in full upon submission of "as built plans" and written certification by a professional civil engineer, registered in the State of Nevada, that the storm water practice has been installed in accordance with the approved plan and other applicable provisions of this section. The community development department will make a final inspection of the storm water practice to ensure that it is in compliance with the approved plan and the provisions of this section. 
a.  Provisions for a partial pro-rata release of the performance security based on the completion of various development stages can be done provided that each of the following is satisfied: 
i.  At least 50 percent of the secured improvements are completed; 
ii.  The applicant has submitted an estimate of the work remaining that is sealed by a professional civil engineer registered in the State of Nevada; and 
iii.  The applicant has provided evidence in a form acceptable to the community development department of replacement security in the lower amount. 
(2)  A reduction of the security may be considered once each calendar year or upon completion of 25 percent, 50 percent, or 80 percent of the secured items. The dollar amount of no one item, as set forth in the bond estimate as approved by the city, shall be reduced below ten percent of the original item amount, and further the security shall at no time be reduced below 20 percent of the original security amount until all storm water practices have been completed in a manner acceptable to the city. The following procedure is to be followed when requesting a reduction in security: 
a.  The subdivider/developer shall make a formal request in writing to the city that the security be renegotiated. 
b.  The project engineer must provide the city with an estimate of the work remaining in the format as provided by the city. 
c.  The city will determine the total amount of security reduction allowed based on the estimated amount of work remaining as provided by the project engineer and verified by the city, and shall provide the subdivider/developer with a revised bond estimate. 
d.  The subdivider/developer shall submit to the city new security, in the format as provided by the city with a revised bond estimate attached, for the storm water practices remaining. 
e.  Upon approval as to legal form of the new security by the city attorney, the new security will be filed with the city clerk and the old security document returned. 
(3)  In no case shall a reduction in security be construed as constituting a final acceptance of storm water practices by the city, either in whole or in part. 
(g)  Maintenance and Repair of Storm Water Quality Facilities.   
(1)  Access and Maintenance Agreement. Prior to the issuance of any permit requiring post construction storm water quality management, the applicant or owner of the site shall execute a storm water treatment device access and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the storm water quality management facility. The agreement shall be on a form substantially similar to Appendix D of the Truckee Meadows Low Impact Development Manual and shall be approved as to form by the city attorney's office. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the City of Reno, or their contractor or agent, and for assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this article. The applicant shall record the agreement with Washoe County and provide a copy of the recorded document to the City of Reno before permits may be issued. 
(2)  Records of Installation and Maintenance Activities. Applicants and/or owners responsible for the operation and maintenance of a post construction storm water quality management facility shall maintain records of all maintenance and repairs. These records shall be made available during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon request. 
(3)  Requirements for Maintenance. All post construction storm water management facilities shall undergo, at a minimum, an annual inspection by the persons responsible for their operation and maintenance to document and perform maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of this article and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include but are not limited to; removal of silt, litter and other debris from the catch basins, inlets and drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation removal, and necessary replacement of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a timely manner. 
(4)  City Inspection of Storm Water Facilities. Inspections include, but are not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or other pollutants; inspections of businesses or industry of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the NPDES storm water permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws, reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, ground water, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other storm water treatment practices. 
(5)  Right of Entry for Inspection When Connection is Private to Public. When any new connection is made or when any new connection is made between private property and a public drainage control system or sanitary sewer, the property owner shall grant to the City of Reno on a form provided by or acceptable to city the right to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this section is occurring or has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this article. 
(Ord. No. 6088, § 1, 2-11-09; Ord. No. 6385, § 1, 1-13-2016) 
ARTICLE V: - TREE PROTECTION 

Section 18.12.501. - Applicability. 
This article's tree protection standards shall apply to all new construction and land disturbing activity subject to city requirements for a grading or building permit, where the administrator determines the construction or land disturbing activity is expected to adversely affect mature healthy trees on the site. Such determination shall be made prior to or concurrent with an application for a grading or building permit. 
Section 18.12.502. - Preserved Tree Criteria. 
A tree shall be considered to be preserved only if a minimum of 75 percent of the critical root zone is maintained at undisturbed natural grade and no more than 25 percent of the canopy is removed due to building encroachment. 
Section 18.12.503. - Tree Credits. 
Existing mature, healthy trees that are preserved along public rights-of-way or in the front yard may be eligible for a credit toward the total tree requirements stated in Section 18.12.1209's minimum landscaping requirements or in the street tree requirements stated in Section 18.12.1205 of this chapter. Eligibility for tree credits shall be based on size and condition of the existing trees as determined by the urban forester at the time of application for a building permit. The tree credit may not exceed 30 percent of the required number of trees on the lot. The credit must be approved by the administrator. 
Example:  •  One 24-inch caliper tree is saved in the front yard = 9 new tree credits (24 
inches divided by 2.5 inches per required tree = 9.6 trees)  •  20 new trees required on lot  •  6 of the 20 new trees (30 percent of 20) will not have to be installed  
Section 18.12.504. - Replacement of Trees/Penalty for Removal. 
Where existing mature, healthy trees, as determined by the administrator in consultation with the urban forester, are removed along public rights-of-way or in the front yard as a result of any construction, they shall be replaced based on the size of the tree, with deciduous trees of a minimum caliper of two and one-half inches and evergreen trees with a minimum height of ten feet. The maximum tree penalty for this section is 30 percent. Replacement trees required under this section shall count toward the minimum number of trees required elsewhere in this chapter. 
Example:  • One 24-inch caliper tree is removed in the front yard = penalty of 10 two inch caliper trees (24 inches divided by 2.5 inches per required tree = 9.6)  • 20 new trees are required on the lot  • 26 new trees (30 percent of 20 = 6) must be installed  
Section 18.12.505. - Tree Mitigation Plan. 
A tree preservation plan shall be provided by an arborist where construction is expected to adversely impact mature healthy trees. Unless otherwise approved in writing by the urban forester, the following procedures shall be followed on all construction projects: 
(a)  Tree Flagging. All protected trees on the subject property within 50 feet of a construction area or surface improvements, such as driveways and walks, shall be flagged with bright fluorescent orange vinyl tape wrapped around the main trunk at a height of four feet or more, so that the tape is visible to workers operating construction equipment. 
(b)  Open Space Flagging. All trees or groups of trees within areas intended to be saved as open space shall be enclosed with fluorescent orange tape along all areas of possible access or intrusion by construction equipment. Tape shall be supported at a minimum of 25-foot intervals by wrapping trees or utilizing another approved method. Access for the purposes of clearing underbrush is allowed outside of riparian zones. 
(c)  Protective Fencing. In those situations where a protected tree is so close to the construction area that construction equipment will infringe on the root system, a protective fence may be required between the tree and the construction activity. See Figures 18.12-13 and 18.12-14. 
(d)  Bark Protection. In situations where a protected tree remains in the immediate area of intended construction, the tree shall be protected by enclosing the entire circumference of the tree with two-inch by four-inch lumber encircled with wire or other means that do not damage the tree. This will protect the bark of the tree against incidental contact by large construction equipment. 
Section 18.12.506. - Reserved. 
  
  
  
  
  
Section 18.12.507. - Prohibited Activities Adjacent to Trees. 
The following activities shall be prohibited within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree, subject to the requirements of this ordinance: 
(a)  Material Storage. No materials intended for use in construction, or waste materials accumulated due to excavation or demolition, shall be placed within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree. 
(b)  Equipment Cleaning/Liquid Disposal. No equipment shall be cleaned, or other materials or liquids deposited or allowed to flow over land, within the limits of the critical root zone of a protected tree. This includes, without limitation, paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar, or similar materials. 
(c)  Tree Attachments. No signs, wires, or other attachments other than those of a protective nature shall be attached to any protected tree. 
(d)  Vehicular Traffic. No vehicular and/or construction equipment traffic or parking shall take place within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree other than on an existing paved street or parking lot. This restriction does not apply to single incident access within the critical root zone for purposes of clearing underbrush, establishing the building pad and associated lot grading, vehicular traffic necessary for routine utility maintenance or emergency restoration of utility service or routine mowing operations. 
(e)  Grade Changes. No grade changes in excess of two inches (cut or fill) shall be allowed within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree unless adequate construction methods are utilized which have been approved by the Urban Forester. 
Section 18.12.508. - Permitted Construction Methods. 
(a)  Boring. Boring of utilities under protected trees may be required in certain circumstances. When required, the length of the bore shall be at a minimum the width of the critical root zone, and shall be at a minimum depth of 48 inches. 
(b)  Grade Change. Grade changes within the critical root zone of a protected tree should not exceed two inches. If more than 25 percent of the critical root zone is disturbed by trenching or a grade change greater than two inches, the applicant may be required to prune the root zone or tree canopy in accordance with industry standards, or to take some other mitigative measure to help preserve the health of the tree. 
(c)  Trenching. All trenching shall be designed to avoid crossing the critical root zone of any protected tree. 
(d)  Root Pruning. All roots two inches or larger in diameter which are exposed as a result of trenching or other excavation, shall be cut off and covered with pruning compound within two hours of initial exposure.

(a)  Sidewalks, curbs and gutters shall be required on all lots or parcels of land which are hereafter improved or upon which any building or construction shall take place, with the exception that sidewalks, curbs and gutters are not required in the event of addition to existing structures consisting of 500 square feet or less. In new developments, sidewalk requirements shall be determined at time of map or parcel map approval, typically on both sides of all streets, public and private, unless another means of pedestrian access is approved, or if sidewalk is impractical or is unnecessary for pedestrian access purposes as determined by the administrator. 
(b)  Upon application by a property owner and for cause shown, the administrator may waive the requirement for curb, gutter and/or sidewalk whenever the administrator determines that granting the waiver is a feasible way to implement the preferred design of LID objectives or that it is not practical to be installed at the time of building or construction due to negative impacts on future road construction or improvements, undesirable obstruction to drainage patterns or flow paths, or public safety. Also, the administrator may waive the sidewalk requirement only in the event of repair, remodeling or addition to existing improvements on all lots or parcels of land or for new construction of a single-family residence where sidewalks within 300 feet of the immediate area do not presently exist or where topographic constraints, walls, or landscape obstruction prevent continuous extension on this property or others. No requests for sidewalk waivers will be considered on any lots or parcels of land, except in IB and IC zones, which are located within one-quarter mile of any elementary school, or where traffic volumes are below 1,000 ADT, or where a pedestrian circulation plan has been adopted for an area that indicates no sidewalks are planned for a site unless the administrator determines that granting the waiver is a feasible way to implement the preferred design of LID objectives. Sidewalks may not be required in I, IB, or IC zones, if approved by the administrator. 
(c)  In order to have consideration for any provisions as hereinabove stated, the applicant must provide to the city a hold harmless agreement, subject to the approval of the city attorney. The applicant shall also waive any protest or objection pursuant to state statutes to any future assessment district which may be formed to incorporate sidewalk upon all the tracts in the district and such waiver of protest shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder and the provisions thereof complied with by any successor in interest. 
(d)  The decision of the administration denying the applicant a waiver may be appealed in writing to the city council within ten days after notification of such denial.

(6)  No driveway shall be less than 20 feet in length. 
(7)  No driveway may be located closer than 235 feet from an intersection on major arterials, 150 feet from an intersection on minor arterials, or 50 feet from an intersection on commercial collectors (measured from the end of the corner radius of the pavement). However, where such spacing has been precluded in parcels created prior to adoption of this ordinance, curb-cuts shall be placed as far from the intersection as is possible and may be installed without a variance. See Figure 18.12-15. 
(b)  Curb-Cuts. Where parking on any residential lot is accessible from the street, or access for motor vehicles is desired in business, commercial, or industrial use, provisions shall be made for a driveway. All driveway approaches shall enter properties via a standard curb-cut unless otherwise required or approved by the administrator. 
(1)  Shared Curb-Cuts and Driveways. On arterial streets in the mixed use and nonresidential zoning districts, shared driveways or curb-cuts may be required by the administrator along common lot lines as follows:

Section 18.12.1103. - Permitted Adjustments to Required Parking. 
(a)  Adjustments in the Downtown Reno Regional Center Overlay District.   
(1)  Downtown Parking District Defined. The Downtown Parking District consists of those properties shown within the Downtown Reno Regional Center Overlay District as outlined in Section 18.08.101(i)(1). 
(2)  Off-Site Parking Allowed. Off-street parking required by this section in the Downtown Reno Regional Center Overlay District shall be located on-premise or on properties no further than 1,000 feet from the subject premises, as measured by the most direct walking distance. 
(b)  Allowances for On-Street Parking.   
(1)  Required parking may be located on-street, subject to the following standards: 
a.  The required parking is in any of the following districts or areas: 
1.  A General Transit Corridor Overlay District or General Regional Center District as designated in Chapter 18.08: 
2.  An adopted specific regional center or transit corridor overlay zoning district as designated in Chapter 18.08;

(Ord. No. 5821, § 1, 4-5-06) 
Section 18.12.1104. - Parking Lot Design and Construction. 
(a)  Residential Parking at Rear of Lots. In all residential zoning districts, parking shall be provided in the rear of lots, except for single-family development, or unless topography, drainage or other site restrictions require parking on other locations on the lot. Where alley access exists, parking shall have access off of the alley. The administrator may approve alternative parking locations when site restrictions exist. 
(b)  Circulation on Lot. Adequate ingress, egress, on-premises circulation and maneuvering areas shall be provided. Interior circulation in parking lots shall be designed to avoid any vehicular stacking on arterial or collector streets as the result of vehicular movements within such parking lots. 
(c)  Large Parking Lots. Any development which includes 600 or more parking spaces shall either: 
(1)  Place a minimum of 70 percent of the spaces in excess of 600 within a parking garage; or 
(2)  Provide enhanced landscaping as required in Section 18.12.1205(e) (Parking Area Landscaping and Screening Requirements). 
(d)  Excess Parking Requirements. If more than 110 percent of the required parking is provided, additional landscaping is required (See Section 18.12.1205(e) (Parking Area Landscaping and Screening Requirements)). In lieu of providing the required excess landscaping, a contribution may be made to the city parkway and boulevards landscaping fund. The contribution shall be based on the cost of the additional landscaping which is required. 
(e)  Parking Spaces and Aisle Widths. Parking spaces shall be configured according to Figure 18.12-21 (Off-Street Parking Standard). Aisle widths within parking areas shall conform to Figure 18.12-21, except that a one-way aisle shall be no less than 11 feet in width. 
(f)  Alternative Parking Space Sizes. The administrator may approve alternative parking space sizes in parking garages or to protect unique, natural features that are specifically designed to meet a project's expected needs. The administrator may also approve alternative parking space sizes when it is determined that the reduction is a preferred design component in the implementation of LID objectives. Dedicated employee parking in offices or office complexes with a minimum of 100 stalls may utilize the dimensions given for a nine-foot wide stall, except that the stall width may be reduced to eight and one-half feet. 
(g)  Wheel Stops. Wheel stops or other measures which meet the objectives of wheel stops approved by the administrator shall be provided adjacent to landscaped areas. A two-foot vehicle overhang may be permitted where parking abuts a sidewalk or landscaping with a minimum width of six feet.

ARTICLE XII: - LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING 
(Ord. No. 5189, § 1, 9-26-00) 

Section 18.12.1201. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this section is to establish requirements and standards for landscape and screening to: 
(a)  Enhance the aesthetics of the community, including the visual appearance of city streets in all areas of the city; 
(b)  Promote the use of xeriscape design principles utilizing drought-tolerant or native plants and the efficient use of water; 
(c)  Provide for the health and comfort of the public by using landscaping to aid in reducing dust and erosion, promote psychological benefits and natural diversify in the environment, and reduce the effects of heat and cold on buildings, public areas and parking lots; 
(d)  Reduce visual pollution which might otherwise occur within an urbanized area; 
(e)  Encourage groundwater recharge, wetland preservation, and associated environmental benefits from open spaces; 
(f)  Integrate significant natural features of the city into a landscape that fosters their preservation and enjoyment; 
(g)  Promote screening of surface parking lots from public view; and 
(h)  Encourage landscaped parkways on all streets. 
Section 18.12.1202. - Applicability. 
(a)  New Development. The landscaping and screening standards of this article shall apply to all new development except for approved temporary open lot parking or unless otherwise expressly exempted by this article or title. 
(b)  Existing Uses.   
(1)  Expansion of an Existing Use. When an existing site or use that does not comply with this article's landscaping or screening standards section is expanded, landscaping shall be provided in an amount that is proportionate to such expansion. Preference shall be given to placing landscaping along public streets and other high-visibility areas. An example is provided below to illustrate this requirement: 
  
EXAMPLE: 
Existing Building = 10,000 sq. ft. 
Expansion = 1,000 sq. ft. or 10 percent increase: (1) Zoning = GO District; 20 percent of site required to be landscaped. .10 × .20 = .020 or 2.0 percent of the site is to be landscaped. (2)  Zoning = I District; total required front yard must be landscaped; site has a 20 foot required front yard setback and the lot width is 100 feet, providing a total of 20 x 100 = 2000 sq. ft. of required landscaped area. .10 x 2000 sq. ft. = 200 sq. ft. of new landscaped area that must be added.  
(2)  Major Improvements to an Existing Use. When an existing site or use does not comply with this article's landscaping or screening standards, and such site or use is expanded, remodeled, or otherwise improved, and the value of such improvements over a 24-month period is valued at over 40 percent of the assessed value of the structure on the most recent tax roles (before depreciation), the entire site or use shall be brought into compliance with all landscape and screening requirements unless physically impossible. In determining compliance, the combined value of all buildings on the lot shall be used. 
(3)  Improvements to Existing Parking Areas. When more than ten percent of an existing parking area is repaved, reconstructed, or expanded, excluding top seal or restriping, the parking area shall be brought into compliance with this article's landscaping and screening requirements for parking lots to the extent that the required minimum amount of parking spaces can still be provided. The first priority for newly installed landscaping shall be a five-foot minimum planter along street rights-of-way.

(7)  Credit for Preserving Trees. Preservation of existing, mature, healthy trees on a site may be credited toward compliance with the minimum tree planting requirements stated in Section 18.12.1209. Tree credits must be approved by the administrator according to the provisions stated in Article V (Tree Protection) of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 5189, § 1, 9-26-00; Ord. No. 5473, § 1, 7-16-03) 
(e)  Parking Area Landscaping and Screening Requirements.   
(1)  Applicability. This section's parking area landscaping and screening standards shall apply to all off-street parking areas in all zoning districts, except for off-street parking areas accessory to a single-family or duplex dwelling, or unless superseded by the terms and conditions of an approved Planned Unit Development District or Specific Plan District. 
(2)  Surface Parking Lot Landscaping.   
a.  Landscape areas required.   
1.  Defining parking lots. Landscaping should separate parking lots into a maximum of 350 parking spaces in each defined lot. 
2.  Amount of landscape area. 
i.  Surface parking lots shall incorporate a minimum of 25 square feet of landscaped area for each required off-street parking space. 
ii.  The amount of surface parking lot landscaping required by this subsection shall be credited toward the minimum landscape area requirements for the subject zoning district stated in Section 18.12.1205 above. 
iii.  In no event shall the landscaping provided in surface parking lots be less than 15 percent of the total area of the surface parking lot. 
3.  Additional requirements for parking lots with 600 or more spaces. Surface parking lots with 600 or more spaces visible from the public right-of-way shall meet the following additional requirements: 
i.  A 15-foot wide landscape area, which includes a two-foot high berm, wall or hedge shall be placed around the perimeter of the parking area. Where there is a five-foot or greater grade change between the parking area and the site perimeter, the berm may be waived. 
ii.  An additional ten square feet of landscape area for each parking space in excess of 600 shall be placed in the interior of the parking area. 
4.  Additional requirements for excess parking in surface lots. For any surface parking lot with more than 20 parking spaces, and which provides more than 110 percent of the required parking under Section 18.12.1102 (Off-Street Parking Requirements), the following additional landscaping requirements shall apply: 
i.  A 15-foot wide landscape area, which includes a two-foot high berm, wall or hedge shall be placed around the perimeter of the parking area. Where there is a five-foot or greater grade change between the parking area and site perimeter, the berm may be waived. 
ii.  An additional ten square feet of landscape area for each parking space in excess of 110 percent of the required parking shall be placed in the interior of the parking area. One tree per every three parking spaces which are in excess of 110 percent of the required parking shall be provided within the required landscape areas. 
iii.  In lieu of providing the additional landscaping required with excess parking, a contribution may be made to the city parkway and boulevards landscaping fund. The contribution shall be based on the cost of the additional landscaping which is required. 
5.  Parking lot edge. 
i.  A parking lot edge shall surround each parking lot, and be a minimum of five feet wide excluding any curbing, unless a larger parking edge or perimeter buffer is required by this article. The parking lot edge may overlap any parking setback line. When other provisions of this chapter require a fully landscaped front, side, or rear yard/setback, and such setback area is larger than five feet and is located in the same place as a required parking lot edge, this provision for a landscaped parking edge shall not apply where the landscaped yard/setback is provided. 
ii.  When separating two parking lots, the parking lot edge shall be a minimum of ten feet wide (including any curbing) and shall contain an average minimum three-foot high hedge or two-foot berm. Parking lot edges may facilitate the grading and terracing of parking lots on a site or may be used for pedestrian access. 
6.  Location of required parking lot landscape. Required landscape areas shall occur entirely within the parking lot and parking lot edge boundaries. 
b.  Minimum requirements for required landscape areas.   
1.  General requirements. 
Required landscape areas may take the form of "parking lot edges" or interior "islands" depending on site design and the preservation of natural site features. All landscape areas within parking areas shall: 
i.  Be planted with living plant materials according to this article; and 
ii.  Allow for pedestrian walking surfaces across them to provide improved pedestrian circulation across the parking area. Said walking surfaces count towards meeting the landscape area requirement up to a total of 25 percent of the requirement; and 
iii.  Have a minimum of one tree for each island with the remaining area in shrubs, ground cover, grasses or seasonal color; and 
iv.  Have a minimum of one tree planted at a ratio of 30 feet on center along any street frontage. 
2.  Tree placement and density. 
In meeting the requirement for a minimum number of trees per required landscape area stated in Section 18.12.1209 below, there shall be placed a minimum of one tree for each ten parking spaces in all surface parking areas. These trees may be planted in the interior of each parking area (e.g., in an island) or within the parking lot edge area. Placement of these trees shall be accomplished such that no parking space shall be further than 75 feet from a tree. See Figure 18.12-26. 
3.  Tree size. 
There shall be a minimum of 70 percent large trees with the remainder being small trees. Tree sizes and measurements shall otherwise conform to Section 18.12.1209, Materials and Specifications for Required Landscape Areas. 
4.  Islands. 
An island containing at least one tree shall be located within a maximum of 75 feet of each parking space. The distance is measured from the nearest curb line of the island to the nearest point on the edge of the parking stall. Islands shall be a minimum of 126 square feet in area and ten feet wide, with a tree placed at least four and one-half feet from the back face of any curb. The location of parking lot islands shall recognize convenient pedestrian circulation routes and walks within the island shall be planned accordingly. Parking stalls immediately adjacent to a 30-foot wide landscape buffer strip may be located more than 75 feet from a parking lot island. See Figures 18.12-22 and 18.12-23. 
5.  Existing trees and natural features. 
Notwithstanding the above, the location of landscaped islands should be adjusted to accommodate existing trees or other natural features, provided that the total landscape area requirements are met. 
  
EXAMPLE Calculation: • 350 parking spaces with one tree required for each 10 spaces = 35 trees required. • 25 square feet of permeable green space required per space = 8,750 square feet of landscape area.  
  
  
  
  
(3)  Screening of Parking From Public Areas.   
a.  General. All parking areas shall be screened from view of public roadways. The screen shall be a minimum of 36 inches in height, and be achieved with street trees and one of the following methods: 
1.  A berm; 
2.  A planting screen, including shrubs; 
3.  A decorative wall; or 
4.  A combination of the above, or as shown on the approved detailed site plan. 
See Figures 18.12-24, 18.12-25, and 18.12-26. 
b.  Parking lot edge. Screening shall generally be placed within the parking lot edge zone as defined in Section 18.12.1205(e)(2), above. 
c.  Screening waiver. The screening requirement in this subsection shall be waived when the surface of the entire lot is more than 36 inches below the grade of the street. 
  
  
  
  
(4)  Landscaping of Parking Structures. Unless incorporated into a main building, all parking garages shall comply with the following: 
a.  Parking garages that are 35 feet or less in height shall have a minimum five-foot wide landscape area adjacent to all public rights-of-way (excluding alleys) which shall include at least one tree and five shrubs for each 30 feet of length. Required landscaping may occur in a parkway adjacent to the public right-of-way. See Figure 18.12.27. 
b.  Parking garages of more than 35 feet in height shall, in addition to the requirements in a., above, provide a building inset of five feet in width at each additional 35-foot level or provide other setbacks and/or structure treatments as approved by the administrator in accordance with NRS 278.319. This additional inset or other treatment shall be provided adjacent to all public rights-of-ways (excluding alleys). These areas must contain landscaping in accordance with an approved landscape plan. 
(Ord. No. 5189, § 1, 9-26-00) 
  
(f)  Street Tree Requirements.   
(1)  Trees Required.   
a.  Arterials. On arterial and collector streets outside of the Downtown Reno Regional Center Overlay District, tree shall be planted adjacent to the right-of-way at a rate of one tree for every 30 feet of street frontage. 
b.  Residential streets.   
1.  Trees shall be planted for each lot up to 50 feet in width and at a rate of one tree for every 30 feet of frontage over 50 feet. The tree shall be a minimum two and one-half-inch caliper tree from the city's permitted street tree list as stated in this subsection. 
2.  The city prefers that all residential street trees be planted in the parkway, if one exists. However, the administrator may approve the planting of these trees anywhere between the curb line and the building setback line, but all trees not planted in a parkway shall be setback at least two and one-half feet from the curb line and from the building foundation. 
c.  Downtown Reno Regional Center Overlay District requirements.   
1.  Sub-area requirements. 
Street trees shall be planted as follows. See the City of Reno Redevelopment District Streetscape Master Plan for a delineation of the sub-districts. 
i.  Entertainment core. 
Trees shall be planted at a rate of one for every 30 feet of frontage. 
ii.  Major arterials. 
Trees shall be planted at a rate of one for every 30 feet of frontage. A minimum nine-foot wide planted median is required with medians planted with deciduous trees at a rate of one for every 20 linear feet and with evergreen shrubs not exceeding three feet in height and mulched with river cobble. 
iii.  Urban transition standard. 
Trees shall be planted at a rate of one for every 30 feet of frontage. 
iv.  Neighborhood standard. 
Trees shall be planted at a rate of one for every 30 feet of frontage. 
v.  River corridor standard. 
Trees shall be planted at a rate of one for every 40 feet of frontage. 
vi.  Railroad corridor standard. 
A minimum five-foot wide planter between the parking edge treatment or pathway shall be provided. Turf and plantings shall be provided along the pedestrian path. 
2.  Planting standards. 
i.  Tree standard. 
Street trees shall be deciduous and a minimum two and one-half-inch caliper (measured six inches above ground) at the time of planting. 
ii.  Tree quality. 
Trees shall conform to the Reno Urban Forester's standards for acceptable quality. 
iii.  Species list. 
Notwithstanding the list of permitted street tree species in Section 18.12.1205(f)(5) below, the following tree species are the only street trees permitted in the Downtown Reno Regional Center Overlay District: 
• Pyrus calleryana - Flowering pear 
• Quercus robur 'Fastigiata' - Columnar English Oak 
• Acer griseum - Paperbark Maple 
• Zelkova serrata 'Green Vase' - Green Vase Zelkova 
• Platanus acerifolia 'Bloodgood' - London Plane 
iv.  Tree consistency. 
Trees shall be planted consistently in one species type for each particular standard. 
• Entertainment Core Standard - London Plane 
• Major Arterial Standard - Flowering Pear 
• Neighborhood Standard - Green Vase Zelkova 
• Railroad Corridor Standard - Columnar English Oak 
v.  Modification of species list. 
Conditions may vary within each area, necessitating modifications to the species list. However, consistency in the giant palette along the street scene is the goal. To prevent the possibility of death among all trees of a particular species, the urban forester may recommend subtle variety changes. 
(2)  Planting Schedule. Trees shall be planted prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. The administrator may allow the planting to occur within the next growing season if the certificate of occupancy is issued outside of the growing season and the required landscaping is bonded or guaranteed as described in Section 18.12.1204. 
(3)  Modification of Standards. The administrator may approve a modification of the tree species, tree spacing or planting standard according to the procedures and criteria stated in Section 18.06.411 (Minor Deviations), provided that the overall objectives of creating an attractive streetscape are achieved and the approved modification meets the intent of this section. The applicant shall incorporate all modifications approved by the administrator in the a revised landscape plan and submit the revised plan for the administrator's review and approval within 30 days of the administrator's modification decision. 
(4)  Trees in the Public Right-of-Way.   
a.  Work permit required. Trees planted or removed from the public right-of-way are subject to the issuance of a tree work permit. Placement, species, and type of tree well covering are subject to city approval prior to the issuance of the tree work permit (See RMC Chapter 8.32, Trees and Shrubs). 
b.  Maintenance. Trees planted in the parkways shall be maintained by adjacent property owners, neighborhood associations, special assessment district or maintenance district formed under NRS 278.4787. 
(Ord. No. 5189, § 1, 9-26-00) 
(5)  Approved Street Tree Species. Species diversity is encouraged. The use of only one or two species on a street or on the same block greatly increases the likelihood of epidemic disease and/or insect infestations. Table 18.12-16 below provides the list of approved street tree species in the city.

(Ord. No. 6007, § 4, 2-27-08) 
Section 18.12.1209. - Materials and Specifications for Required Landscape Areas. 
(a)  General Materials Requirements. All required landscape areas must be comprised of trees, shrubs, living and/or non-living ground covers, and/or enhanced paving. This area may also include a cover, roof structure or minor structure over a portion of the area, provided that it will enhance the use of the landscape area. Bare dirt shall not be allowed. 
(b)  Minimum Amount of Trees and Shrubs in Required Landscape Areas.   
(1)  All Zoning Districts Except Industrial Districts. One tree and six shrubs shall be provided for every 300 square feet of required landscaped area, plus one tree for every ten off-street parking spaces as required by this article, except in the industrial zoning districts. 
(2)  Industrial Districts. One tree for every 300 square feet of required front yard landscaping plus one tree for every ten parking spaces is required. At least 50 percent of the required trees shall be evergreen. If any additional screening is required because the industrial site is adjoining residentially or public facility zoned property, those requirements are in addition to the minimums stated in this subsection. 
(c)  Minimum Stocking and Materials Standards. All required landscape areas shall comply with the following minimum stocking and materials standards, unless otherwise varied or modified under this title.. 
(1)  General. Generally, acceptable landscape materials shall include: 
a.  Living plant materials. 
b.  Alternate materials may be used for playing fields, skywalks, or similar situations with the administrator's approval. 
(2)  Ground Cover. Ground cover used in required landscape areas may include the following, or alternatives if equivalent approved by the administrator: 
a.  Lawn or turf. 
b.  Living ground covers other than lawn or turf, planted in a manner so the area designed for the ground cover is fully covered within three years. Ground covers must be a minimum of a four-inch pot container in size. 
c.  Decorative paving, rock, or other inert materials, up to 25 percent of the required landscaped area, unless the administrator approves a different amount after consideration of the visual appearance of the site. Choices of non-living ground cover should be made after considering the flammability and toxicity of available types. When rock is used on slopes 3:1 or steeper, it shall be fractured at least three-inch minimum. Shredded bark/wood may not be used on grades in excess of 4:1. Landscape walls and retaining walls do not require fractured rock. 
d.  Calculation of coverage is by means of the following method: 
1.  Grass and ground covers are calculated based on simple area (length × width). 
2.  Shrubs should be calculated using the area of a shrub based on spacing. Spacing should be presented in the plant list for use of the landscaper and plan review purposes. Spacing should reflect what the expected average size of the shrub should be in three years. 
3.  Calculate the area of shrub coverage based on ;pi; 2 (area of a circle) times the number of shrubs from plant list (;pi; = 3.14, r = radius of shrub spacing). 
  
Example: 20 shrubs with a spacing of 5':3.14 (2.5x2.5)= 19.6 sq. ft. 

19.6x20 = 392 sq. ft. of vegetative cover.  
4.  Total vegetative cover is grass + ground covers + shrub coverages. 
5.  Trees do not count toward vegetative cover unless their branches come down to the ground (evergreen). 
(3)  Trees. In satisfying the landscaping requirements of this section, the use of high-quality, hardy, and drought-tolerant trees is required.

Cross reference- Trailer parks, Chapter 4.54; civil emergencies, Chapter 8.34; health and sanitation, Title 10; buildings and construction, Title 14. 

Section 18.12.1701. - General Provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and Authority. The purpose of this article is to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare by establishing guidelines and requirements for development of property within areas determined to be subject to flood damage. The requirements set forth herein are authorized by NRS Ch. 278 in general and more specifically by NRS 278.020 and NRS 278.250. 
(b)  Applicability. This article shall apply to all flood hazard areas as set forth in the flood insurance rate maps ("FIRMs") and limited flooding areas (shaded X) within the jurisdiction of the city. 
(c)  Basis for Establishing Flood Hazard Areas and Limited Flooding Areas. The flood hazard areas and limited flooding areas (shaded "X") identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the flood insurance study (FIS) dated September 30, 1994 and accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) dated September 30, 1994 and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this article and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this article and which are recommended to the City of Reno by the floodplain administrator. The FIS, and FIRMs are on file at Reno City Hall, 1 East First Street, Reno, NV 89505 in the Department of Public Works. 
(d)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. 
(e)  Abrogation and Greater Requirements. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another chapter, article, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent requirements shall prevail. 
(f)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the city, and shall be deemed to neither limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(g)  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulator purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. This article does not imply that land outside flood hazard areas or limited flooding areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result reliant on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(h)  Letter of Map Amendment.   
(1)  If an owner or developer believes his or her property to be inappropriately designated as being in a flood hazard areas (zone A, A1-30, AH, AE, and AO) or an area of limited flooding (shaded X) on the FIRM, he or she may appeal to FEMA. A successful appeal will show either that the property is higher in elevation than the base flood, or that the elevation of the base flood is incorrect. If the appeal is successful, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide the owner or developer with a letter of map amendment, which will exempt him or her from the requirements of this article and from the mandatory purchase of flood insurance. 
(2)  All appeals should be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. For purposes of this Article, the Floodplain Administrator is the Director of Public Works or designee. The Floodplain Administrator will transmit the appeals to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for its consideration. Appeals should include the following: 
a.  An actual stamped copy of the recorded plat of the property showing official recordation and proper citation, or a photocopy of the property's legal description (e.g., lot, block, and plot number, etc.), or a photocopy of the appropriate page of the county assessor's parcel map. 
b.  A copy of the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with the location of the property identified. 
c.  Certification by a land surveyor. A "land surveyor" means a land surveyor registered in the State of Nevada. The certification shall state: 
1.  The type of structure. 
2.  The elevation of the lowest finished grade adjacent to the structure. 
3.  The elevation of the bottom of the lowest floor beam. 
d.  When appealing the elevation of the base flood, a thorough technical hydrological study of the contributing area which will substantiate the appeal must be submitted and shall be certified by an engineer. 
1.  When base flood elevations in the city either increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, city will submit the technical or scientific data to FEMA. Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of the physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and flood plain management requirements will be based upon current data.

d.  For all new construction and substantial improvements, fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(3)  Elevation and floodproofing.   
a.  In zones A, A1-30, AH, and AE, new construction and substantial improvement of any structure shall have the bottom of the lowest floor beam or basement floor elevated to one foot or more above the base flood elevation. Nonresidential structures will meet the standards in paragraph d, below. 
b.  New construction and substantial improvement to any structure in a zone AO shall have the bottom of the lowest floor beam or basement floor elevated from finish grade adjacent to the building at least one foot above the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). If there is no depth number on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), the bottom of the lowest floor beam or basement floor shall be elevated to a depth of at least two feet above the finished grade adjacent to the building. Nonresidential structures will meet standards in paragraph d, below. 
c.  New construction and substantial improvement to any structure in a "shaded X" shall have the bottom of the lowest floor beam or basement floor elevated to at least one foot above the highest existing grade adjacent to the building, or one foot above the highest top of curb on the street adjacent to the property, as approved by the Floodplain Administrator. Nonresidential structures will meet standards in paragraph d, below. 
d.  Nonresidential construction shall either be elevated in conformance with paragraphs a., b., or c., or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed as follows: 
1.  Zone A: At least one foot above the base flood elevation.

An acceptable option requires that the recreational vehicle be elevated on a permanent foundation so that the lowest portion of the floor will be elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(b)  Standards for Alluvial Fans. Areas subject to alluvial fan flooding have irregular flow paths that result in erosion of existing channels and the undermining of fill material. Those areas are identified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) as AO and AH zones with velocities. 
(1)  All structures must be securely anchored to minimize the impact of the flood and sediment damage. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements must be elevated on pilings, columns, or armored fill so that the bottom lowest floor beam is elevated at least one foot above the depth number. 
(3)  All fill materials must be armored to protect the material from the velocity of the flood flow. 
(4)  Provide adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(5)  All proposals for subdivision development must provide a mitigation plan that identifies the engineering methods used to: 
a.  Protect structures from erosion and scour caused by the velocity of the flood flow. 
b.  Capture or transport flood and sediment flow through the subdivision to a point of deposition that will not create a health or safety hazard. 
(6)  All manufactured homes shall be prohibited within the identified hazard area except within existing manufactured home parks or existing manufactured home subdivisions. 
(c)  Standards for Utilities.

(3)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
(4)  All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters or discharge from the systems into flood waters. Sanitary sewer and storm drainage systems for buildings that have openings below the base flood elevation shall be provided with automatic backflow valves or other automatic backflow devices that are installed in each discharge line passing through a building's exterior wall. 
(d)  Standards for Subdivisions.   
(1)  In addition to the requirements for subdivisions set forth in NRS Chapter 278 and Chapter 18.10 of this Title, the following requirements apply: 
a.  All tentative subdivision maps shall identify the flood hazard area, the limited flooding area, and the elevation of the base flood. 
b.  All subdivision improvement plans shall identify the flood hazard area, the limited flooding area, the elevation of the base flood, the elevation of proposed structure(s), pads, and adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood, the final pad elevation shall be certified by an engineer or surveyor and provided to the city. 
c.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
d.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage to these utilities. 
e.  All subdivision proposals shall demonstrate that adequate drainage will be provided to reduce exposure to flood damage as set forth in this section.

c.  By bolting the frame or undercarriage to a reinforced, permanent foundation such as a retaining wall or storm wall used to set the unit. 
(2)  Adequate surface drainage and access for a hauler shall be provided. 
(3)  All manufactured homes shall be placed on pads or lots elevated on compacted fill or on pilings so that the lowest floor of the mobile home is at least one foot above the base flood level. If elevated on pilings: 
a.  The lots shall be large enough to permit steps; 
b.  The pilings shall be placed in stable soil no more than ten feet apart; and 
c.  A lateral reinforcement shall be provided for pilings taller than six feet above ground level. 
(4)  No manufactured home shall be placed in a floodway. 
(5)  Neither an existing manufactured home park nor an existing manufactured home subdivision shall be allowed to expand into a floodway. 
(f)  Floodways.   
(1)  Located within flood hazard areas are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, any encroachment, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development is prohibited in the floodway. 
(2)  If no floodway is identified, the permit applicant shall provide an engineering study for the project area that establishes a setback from the stream bank within which no encroachment of any new development will be allowed. Development occurring beyond the setback will be allowed only to the extent that the elevation of the base flood is not increased more than one foot at any point. The area reserved for conveyance between the stream channel and the setback shall be capable of discharging the base floodwaters without causing increased flood levels or velocities upstream or downstream. 
(g)  Closed Intermittent Lakes, Restrictions. Development within watersheds contributing to closed basins and intermittent lakes shall not raise the base flood water surface elevation. Any development that would cause an expansion of the limits of the area designated as A, A1-30, AH, AE, and AO zones as shown on the FEMA maps shall require prior map amendment pursuant to Section 18.12.1701(h).

Section 18.12.1704. - Remedies. 
(a)  In addition to the provisions of Chapter 18.22, "Enforcement, Violations, and Penalties," the city has the following remedies: 
(1)  Declaration of public nuisance. Every new structure, building, fill, excavation or development located or maintained within any area of special flood hazard must comply with the FIRM in effect at the time the structure, building, fill, excavation or development is permitted. Any new structure, building, fill, excavation or development within any area of special flood hazard which is not in compliance with the governing FIRM is a public nuisance per se and may be abated, prevented, or restrained by action of the city. 
(2)  Abatement of violations. Within 30 days of discovery of a violation of this ordinance, the floodplain administrator may: 
a.  Request the property owner of the property upon which the violation exists to provide whatever additional information may required for their determination. Such information must be provided to the city within five days; and/or 
b.  Consider whether any application for a variance on file by the property owner is sufficient mitigation to withhold any further remedial action until the city makes a decision to grant or deny the variance. The duty to consider the effects of an application for a variance shall be a continuing duty of the Floodplain Administrator. At any time during the time that the variance application is being considered, the Floodplain Administrator may take any remedial action allowable under the law, he or she deems appropriate; and/or 
c.  Take any action to effect the abatement of such violations allowable under the law; and/or 
d.  Submit to the administrator of Federal Insurance Administration a declaration for denial of insurance, stating the property is in violation of a cited statute or ordinance pursuant to section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended. 
(Ord. No. 3153 § 1, 1-9-84; Ord. No. 3529, § 1, 6-22-87; Ord. No. 4418, § 1, 8-23-94; Ord. No. 5978, § 1, 10-24-07) 
Section 18.12.1705. - Variances. 
(a)  Nature of Variances   
(1)  A variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by ordinance. 
(2)  The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
(3)  The need to protect the public from flooding is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance regulations provided in this ordinance are more detained and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternative other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(b)  In deciding whether to grant variances, the city shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and 
(1)  The danger of materials being swept onto other lands and injuring others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
(11)  The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
(c)  Procedure.   
(1)  The procedure for obtaining a variance shall be in accordance with Title 18, "Annexation and Land Development," Chapter 18.06, "Administration and Procedures," Article II: Common Procedural Requirement, and Article IV: Zoning Review and Approval Procedures, where applicable. 
(d)  Conditions.   
(1)  In addition to the considerations set forth in subsection b, the city shall consider that: 
a.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvements, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of on-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures, considerations, conditions, and findings set forth in this ordinance have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing a the variance increases. 
b.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
c.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood level during the based flood discharge would result. 
d.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this ordinance. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City of Reno need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposed, but only to that elevation which the City of Reno believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
e.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that subsection a-d are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. With respect to nuisances in this article, the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of the entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of person, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
(e)  Findings.   
(1)  After consideration of the factors set forth in subsection (b) and the conditions set forth in subsection (d) to approve an application for a variance, the city shall grant a variance upon a: 
a.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in hardship to the applicant. The hardship shall be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbor likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as a hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
c.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, conflict with existing local laws or ordinances, or commit fraud/victimization on the public. With respect to fraud/victimization, the city will consider the fact and that every newly constructed building adds to government building responsibilities, and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increase risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. Additionally future owners may be unaware of the risk potential to the property due to flood damage and the extremely high rates for flood insurance, and 
d.  Making of the findings set forth in Section 18.06.408, as amended from time to time. 
(f)  Upon consideration of all the factors and considerations and the purposes of this article, the city may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

ARTICLE XIX: - DRAINAGE WAY PROTECTION STANDARDS 

Section 18.12.1901. - Findings. 
The city finds that the protection of drainage ways in the City of Reno is important to the public health, safety, and welfare and that their protection under this article implements the city's mandated policies to preserve major drainage ways as open and recreational space, and to save and improve these public resource areas for future generations. 
(Ord. No. 5978, § 3, 10-24-07) 
Section 18.12.1902. - Purpose. 
The specific purposes of this article are to carry out the provisions of the City of Reno Major Drainageways Plan, an element of the City of Reno Master Plan and to establish standards for the review of development proposals within major drainage ways to: 
(a)  Ensure the safety of people and property by providing for drainage of storm waters; 
(b)  Maintain, preserve, or enhance the quality of the water in both the Truckee River and Stead basins; 
(c)  Maintain or improve wildlife habitats, native vegetation, and natural terrain; 
(d)  Reduce the need for the expenditure of public funds to remedy or avoid flood hazards, erosion, or other situations caused by inappropriate alterations of natural watercourses; 
(e)  Provide open space land, especially in environmentally sensitive areas, with development where high densities require new approaches and attention to open space needs; 
(f)  Improve or enhance wildlife corridors in urban areas to maintain the quality of life and the ecological balance of the community; and 
(g)  Assure that drainageways are used for public access and recreational facilities, where determined appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 5978, § 3, 10-24-07) 
Section 18.12.1903. - Applicability. 
(a)  The drainageway protection standards in this Article XIX shall apply to all new development that is located within a major drainageway. For purposes of this article, a "major drainageway" is a drainageway that drains a land area of 100 acres or more. Some of these are shown on the Major Drainageways Plan Map, as amended from time to time. Other major drainageways may exist that are not shown on this map (i.e. in recently annexed areas). 
(Ord. No. 5978, § 3, 10-24-07) 
Section 18.12.1904. - Generally Applicable Protection Standards. 
(a)  Unless otherwise specified though the approval of a "major" special use permit in accordance with Section 18.06.405, all drainageways shall be the width of the 100-year floodplain with a minimum 15-foot wide area on each side. 
(b)  Maintenance of the drainage ways shall be performed by the property owner including but not limited to, removal of trash, clearing of sediments and debris, and clearing of weeds. 
(c)  Soils, grading spoils, rubbish, abandoned autos and auto bodies, etc., which impair the usefulness or capacity of the drainage way as a water storage and transport area, shall not be introduced into the drainage way. In cases of severe destruction (cannot be remedied by general maintenance) of the drainage way's vegetation and capacity as a water storage and transport area, the property owner or the person determined to have disrupted the channel will be required to rehabilitate the drainage way to a stable condition comparable to pre-disturbance capacity. 
(d)  There shall be no net loss of wetlands, stream environments, playas, stream fed riparian and non-404 wetlands in terms of both acreage and value. See Article XVIII above for applicable wetland and stream environment protection standards. 
(e)  Drainage ways will not be piped and/or filled in unless there are no alternatives (i.e. re-route or bridge). 
(f)  Engineered improvements to the drainage way shall emphasize reducing erosion, improving water quality, and controlling velocities. 
(Ord. No. 5978, § 3, 10-24-07; Ord. No. 6000, § 19, 1-30-08) 
Section 18.12.1905. - Additional Standards for Natural Drainage Ways. 
(a)  All natural drainage courses within project sites that are shown on the major drainage way plan or the wetland and stream environment policy must be preserved as open space. 
(b)  All natural drainage ways shall remain undisturbed except for enhancements to existing vegetation. 
(c)  No grading shall occur within a natural drainage way except for that which is required for the construction of bicycle/pedestrian paths or necessary roadway or utility crossings. 
(d)  Whenever development comes in contact with a natural drainage way, the drainageway shall be marked and restricted as a non-construction area during construction (i.e. no stock piling of materials, no parking of equipment, no dumping of refuse, soils, or rocks, and no construction roads). Sediment fencing or other suitable treatment shall be employed to protect the channel from sediment loaded runoff into the drainageway. 
(e)  The fencing of properties adjacent to the natural drainage way shall be no more than six feet in height and shall be black, green, or brown chain link, wooden split-rail, ornamental iron or an acceptable alternative. Such alterative treatment shall be described in detail at the time the project is presented to the planning staff. Slats will not be allowed in the chain link fence; however vegetative screening is permissible. Solid wooden fences are strongly discouraged adjacent to drainage ways. Any development adjacent to a drainage way shall submit a detailed fencing plan for approval by the administrator or decision-making body. 
(f)  Native and drought-tolerant or riparian vegetation, whichever is deemed most appropriate, shall be used in the natural drainage way. 
(g)  If channelization of a natural drainage course is deemed necessary by the city, natural materials must be utilized.

Section 18.12.1906. - Reserved. 
Section 18.12.1907. - Additional Standards for Disturbed Drainage Ways. 
(a)  Native and drought-tolerant or riparian vegetation, whichever is deemed most appropriate, shall be used in the disturbed drainageway. 
(b)  In the event that a drainageway is disturbed during development activity, (e.g. stripping of natural vegetation), the developer will be required to: 
(1)  Perform analysis of soils including pH texture, depth, type, and compaction; 
(2)  Identify the direction of exposure (i.e. southern) of all surfaces and slopes of the drainage way; 
(3)  Prepare discussion of the characteristic behavior of water and moisture in the drainage way; 
(4)  Except for drainage ways designated to be "landscaped", prepare listing of diversified plant communities, with an emphasis on shrubs and forbs and consideration of wildlife needs, proposed for planting in the drainage way and the methods for irrigation; 
(5)  Submit above with any other information explaining process by which the drainage way will be enhanced or the natural condition reestablished for review and approval by planning staff; 
(6)  If the rehabilitation or modification is deemed acceptable, the owner/developer shall deposit a bond or letter of credit in the amount determined by the city to assure that plantings within the natural drainage way will be permanently established. The security shall remain in effect until the city determines that plantings have been permanently established, or for a period of not more than four years; and 
(7)  In the event the city determines that rehabilitation and plantings have not been permanently established within the four-year period following construction, the city will determine the cost to replace and permanently establish such plantings. Such costs shall be deducted from the security and retained by the city for rehabilitating the drainage way. Any remaining security will be returned to the owner/developer.

ARTICLE XX: - SKYWAYS AND SKYWAY DESIGN GUIDELINES 

Section 18.12.2001. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this section is to establish a process for the review of development proposals which include skyways, as defined in Chapter 18.24 (Definitions), to ensure that proposed skyways: 
(a)  Are consistent with the orderly development of the project; 
(b)  Are architecturally compatible with the supporting buildings and the surrounding environment; 
(c)  Will not have a significant detrimental effect on the volume of street level activity; 
(d)  Have been designed to enhance the aesthetics of the community and to lessen the "tunnel effect" of elevated structures and include appropriate aesthetic treatment above and along the covered roadway; and 
(e)  Preserve "view corridors" in Reno, as they may be established from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 5189, § 1, 9-26-00) 
Section 18.12.2002. - Applicability. 
No building permit shall be issued to erect or construct any development proposal which includes a skyway unless the requirements of this section are met and a "major" special use permit is obtained, subject to the requirements of Section 18.06.405 (Special Use Permit), except that all proposals under this section shall require a hearing by the City Council. 
(Ord. No. 5189, § 1, 9-26-00; Ord. No. 6000, § 20, 1-30-08) 
Section 18.12.2003. - Prohibited Skyway Locations. 
No skyway shall be permitted to bridge: 
(a)  Virginia Street between the north ramp of the freeway (I-80) on the north and Liberty Street on the south. Virginia Street has been identified as the signature pedestrian street of Reno and as such should not be obstructed; 
(b)  The Truckee River, within the Reno City limits as further depicted on Figure 18.12-40 below. The Truckee River has been identified as a Scenic View Corridor; 
(c)  Second Street between Evans Avenue on the east and West Fourth Street on the west. Second Street provides one of the few remaining unobstructed pedestrian corridors in Downtown Reno with views to the mountains. Additionally, the Virginia Street and Second Street intersection, originally the center of Downtown Reno, is also a pedestrian corridor; 
(d)  Fourth Street between Evans Avenue on the west and Wells Avenue on the east. Fourth Street is an important historic corridor between Reno and Sparks and as such should not be covered unless an area plan has been completed which recommends skyways; 
(e)  Sierra Street between the north ramp of the Freeway (I-80) on the north and Elm Street on the south, which is a portion of the North Gateway; 
(f)  Center Street between the north ramp of the Freeway (I-80) and Seventh Street, which is a portion of the North Gateway; 
(g)  The south ramp of the Freeway (I-80), within the North Gateway; and 
(h)  First Street between West Street and Ralston Street, and Arlington Avenue between the River Corridor at First Street and Second Street. These street segments help provide an unobstructed view of the River Corridor. 
(Ord. No. 5189 § 1, 9-26-00) 
  
Section 18.12.2004. - Special Use Permit Required. 
(a)  Skywalks and Skytrams. Pedestrian skywalks and skytrams are permitted throughout Reno, subject to the issuance of a "major" special use permit, except where skyways of any type are prohibited. (See Figure 18.12-37 Skyway Prohibition Area). 
(b)  Skybuildings. Skybuildings are only permitted in a regional center planning area overlay zoning district (Section 18.08.405), except where skyways of any type are prohibited. (See Figure 18.12-37 Skyway Prohibition Area). Skybuildings shall require a "major" special use permit. 
(c)  Consent Required. If the owners of at least 75 percent of the frontage on both sides of the affected block of any street proposed for a skybuilding consent in writing to the application, then finding "d." in Section 18.06.405(e)(10) is assumed to have been met.

Section 18.12.2005. - Design-General Provisions. 
(a)  Skyway Design Guidelines. Skyway design guidelines are hereby adopted in order to provide design standards for skyways. The skyway design guidelines are set forth in Appendix B to Title 18, and are hereby incorporated by reference. These guidelines may be amended only after a public hearing by the planning commission and adoption of a resolution by the city council. 
(b)  Compliance With Design Guidelines. Skyways shall conform to the skyways design guidelines stated in Appendix B to this title. To demonstrate that proposed skyways are in substantial conformance with the skyway design manual, photo renderings shall be required with a development application that includes a skyway. Photo renderings shall include all of the following: 
(1)  80 inches by 11 inches color photographs of the existing street views in each direction, at the pedestrian and vehicular level, showing the views that exist for that roadway, including the structures abutting the street for a distance of not less than 100 feet, and including any other skyways within 660 feet of the proposed skyway in the Downtown Reno Regional Center Overlay District or 1,320 feet of the proposed skyway outside the Downtown Reno Regional Center Overlay District; and 
(2)  80 inches by 11 inches color renderings, which are an accurate representation of the proposed skyway added to the photographs; and 
(3)  Photographs and photo renderings that are at least 24 inches by 36 inches in size for display purposes; and 
(4)  35 mm slides of the photographs/photo renderings; and 
(5)  At the city's discretion, the applicant may be required to provide a scale model depicting the accurate colors and materials of the proposed skyway and terminus buildings.

(a)  In the event that all improvements shown on Exhibit "A" to the improvement agreement cannot be completed and the public improvements accepted by the city within the time period of the improvement agreement, the developer may make application to the city for an improvement agreement extension, not to exceed two years, which requires new security for the public improvements in an amount determined by the city. Granting of such extension will require approval by the administrator. In the event that the administrator denies a request for an extension, or an extension is granted by the city manager or his designee and at the end of a two-year period following such extension, substantial improvements as shown on Exhibit "A" to the improvement agreement have not been completed, the city council may cause any or all lands within the recorded plat to be reverted to acreage. 
(b)  The subdivider/developer shall file with the city at least 30 days prior to the date for which approval of an improvement agreement extension is sought, the following, including the service charge:

Issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy will be terminated immediately upon default of the subdivision improvement agreement, and the security for public improvements may be called on as set forth in Section 18.14.303. "Stop-work" orders will be immediately issued and remain in effect until a subdivision improvement agreement extension has been granted by the city; or the city resorts to the security and causes completion of the public subdivision improvements, or causes reversion to acreage. In the event of the reversion of the land to acreage, the land must be restored to a condition that does not pose a threat to the health, safety and welfare of the community, and any public improvements which are determined by the city to be necessary for the well being of the community shall be provided. The city council may determine and cause some or all of the public improvements to be installed by the city and expenses thereof assessed against the lots or parcels within the subdivision in accordance with the charter provisions of the city.

(a)  Recognizing that the City of Reno is a unique city in which public safety, maintenance, and enhancement of the city's esthetic qualities are important and effective in promoting quality of life for its inhabitants and the City of Reno's 24-hour gaming/ entertainment/ recreation/ tourism economy; recognizing that the promotion of tourism generates a commercial interest in the environmental attractiveness of the community; and recognizing that the visual landscape is more than a passive backdrop in that it shapes the character of our city, community, and region, the purpose of this article is to establish a comprehensive system for the regulation of the commercial use of off-premises advertising displays. It is intended that these regulations impose reasonable standards on the number, size, height, and location of off-premises advertising displays to prevent and alleviate needless distraction and clutter resulting from excessive and confusing off-premises advertising displays; to safeguard and enhance property values; and to promote the general welfare and public safety of the city's inhabitants and to promote the maintenance and enhancement of the city's esthetic qualities and improve the character of our city. It is further intended that these regulations provide one of the tools essential to the preservation and enhancement of the environment, thereby protecting an important aspect of the economy of the city which is instrumental in attracting those who come to visit, vacation, live, and trade and to permit noncommercial speech on any otherwise permissible sign.

From and after the designation of the placement of a resource or district on the City of Reno Historic Register, no exterior portion of any building or other exterior feature including masonry walls, fences, light fixtures, steps, pavement, advertising signs or other appurtenant features on the parcel shall be erected, altered, restored, moved or partially demolished until after an application for a certificate of appropriateness as to exterior features has been submitted to and approved by the historical resources commission except as provided in Section18.18.301(b) above. Design guidelines or standards may be adopted by the city council for the area surrounding historic resources or historic districts. In an historic district, street widening, utility, street lighting, and bridge replacement projects, which involve undergrounding or relocation of aboveground facilities, or sidewalk projects, which involve relocation or widening, shall require a certificate of appropriateness. Such a certificate shall be obtained prior to the issuance of a building permit for the purpose of constructing, altering, moving or partially demolishing historic resources, but shall be required whether or not a building permit is required. Any permit not issued in conformity with this section shall be invalid. 
(c)  Application Procedure.   
(1)  Pre-application meeting. It shall be the policy of the historical resources commission, in regard to applications involving new structures or extensive alterations and additions to existing structures, that a committee of the historical resources commission shall be available to meet informality with the applicant or his/her agent at an early stage in the design process to advise them concerning the historical resources commission guidelines, the nature of the area where the proposed work is to take place and other relevant factors. The committee, collectively and individually, shall refrain from any indication of approval or disapproval of the proposal, but shall not be barred from a reasonable discussion of the applicant's proposals. No advice or opinion given, or reported as having been given, by any member of the committee at such informal meeting shall be in any way official or binding upon the historical resources commission. A meeting of the committee shall be called at the request of an applicant. 
(2)  Application. An application accompanied by sketches, drawings, photographs, specifications, descriptions, and any other necessary information regarding the proposed project, must be submitted at least 15 working days prior to the meeting of the historical resources commission. 
(3)  Notice. All property owners of property within 300 feet of the subject property shall be notified by mail at least ten days prior to the meeting at which the matter is to be heard using stamped, addressed envelopes supplied by the applicant. 
(4)  Public hearing. The historical resources commission shall hold a public hearing concerning the application. 
(5)  Findings. In reviewing a certificate of appropriateness, the historical resources commission shall take into account the historic or architectural significance of the structure under consideration, the exterior form and appearance of any proposed additions or modifications to that structure, as well as the effect of such change or additions upon other structures in the vicinity and shall make findings related to the following standards: 
a.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property that requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or site and its environment, or to use a property for its original purpose. 
b.  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural feature should be avoided, when possible. 
c.  All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and that seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged. 
d.  Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right. This significance shall be recognized and respected. 
e.  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship that characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
f.  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of features, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence, rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
g.  The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken. 
h.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project. 
i.  Contemporary design or alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and when such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the property, neighborhood or environment. 
(6)  Economic finding. In the event that the historical resources commission denies a certificate of appropriateness, then the historical resources commission must review the economic effects on the owner of the property and make a finding as to whether or not an economic hardship has been created as outlined within this chapter. 
(7)  Decision. The historical resources commission must approve or deny a certificate of appropriateness within 45 days after acceptance of a complete application, except when the time limit has been extended by mutual agreement between the applicant and the historical resources commission. The certificates may be issued subject to reasonable conditions necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter, it is necessary for the historical resources commission to prepare a plan to alleviate anticipated economic hardship, then the above time limit is automatically extended by 60 days, during which time the city council shall not consider any action regarding the subject property. 
(8)  Notification of decision. The decision of the historical resources commission shall be sent by regular mail to the applicant within seven days following the historical resources commission's action. A copy of the decision shall also be forwarded to those departments or divisions responsible for the issuance of permits. 
(9)  Appeal. A decision by the historical resources commission to approve shall be a final decision. A decision by the historical resources commission to approve with conditions or to deny a certificate of appropriateness may be appealed to the city council by completing an appeal form and filing it with the city clerk within ten days of the date of the meeting at which the decision was made. Upon receipt of an appeal on the appropriate form accompanied by the service charge approved by the city council for appeals, the city clerk shall give notice by regular mail to the applicant and all property owners within 300 feet of the subject property at least ten days prior to the date of the public hearing. Said notice shall contain the date, time, place and purpose of the public hearing and the street address or approximate location of the subject property. 
(d)  Repeat Applications. If the historical resources commission denies an application for a certificate of appropriateness, a new application affecting the same property may be submitted within one year of the denial only if either a substantial change is made in the plans for the proposed alteration, construction, restoration, reconstruction, moving or demolition or other conditions related to the register or surrounding uses have changed substantially. 
(e)  Concurrent Approvals. The historical resources commission shall use all reasonable efforts to expedite any concurrent process with the State Historic Preservation Officer, if such a process is desired by the applicant for the purpose of securing both a certificate of appropriateness and a federal historic preservation tax credit. 
(f)  Expiration of Certificate of Appropriateness. If a permit has not been issued, when required, and construction commenced within 18 months of issuance of the certificate of appropriateness by the historical resources commission, the certificate shall expire, unless a time extension has been granted by the historical resources commission prior to the expiration date. If work on an approved project is begun and then suspended for more than one year, the certificate of appropriateness shall expire unless the applicant applies for and receives approval of a time extension from the historical resources commission. 
(Ord. No. 4313, § 1, 6-8-93) 
Section 18.18.306. - Reserved. 
Section 18.18.307. - Economic Effect. 
(a)  If a property or district is nominated for designation or application is made for a certificate of appropriateness, the historical resources commission shall consider the economic effects of approving the proposed designation or denying the certificate of appropriateness. 
(b)  In order to demonstrate economic hardship, the owner shall provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that: 
(1)  The cost of renovating the existing structure, so that it can be used for the intended purpose, exceeds the cost of new construction; or 
(2)  The existing structure cannot be used, even with alterations, for the intended purpose; or 
(3)  The alterations needed to create a structure that will be sufficient to meet the needs of the intended use will destroy the historic or architectural integrity of the property; or 
(4)  Through no fault of the property owner, the area surrounding the historic resource has been significantly altered so as to destroy the integrity of the historic area surrounding the resource; or 
(5)  That designation or denial of a certificate of appropriateness will deny the owner reasonable use or return from the property. 
(c)  If the historical resources commission finds that an economic hardship may occur by designation as a historic resource or historic district or denial of a certificate of appropriateness, the historical resources commission shall submit to the city council for its approval a mutually acceptable plan intended to alleviate the anticipated economic hardship with its recommendation for designation or, in the event of the denial of a certificate of appropriateness, prior to the city council hearing on the appeal. The plan may include incentives such as: 
(1)  Partial or complete tax exemption. 
(2)  Alternative alterations, construction or rehabilitation consistent with preservation standards. 
(3)  City issued revenue or general obligation bonds using the proceeds to make loans for rehabilitation and reuse consistent with preservation standards. 
(4)  Using city funds to make low interest loans for rehabilitation and reuse consistent with preservation standards. 
(5)  Building code modifications or exemptions. 
(6)  Changes in zoning requirements. 
(d)  If the historical resources commission fails to timely submit a plan, or if a mutually acceptable plan cannot be developed, or if the city council fails to approve a plan submitted by the historical resources commission, the city council shall: 
(1)  Acquire the property; or 
(2)  Acquire a historic easement over the property; or 
(3)  Reject the proposed designation; or 
(4)  Grant the certificate of appropriateness.

The deviation of a surface from the horizontal, usually expressed in percent, degree, or as a ratio of horizontal distance (run) to vertical distance (rise or drop) of a slope. 
Slope percent is computed by dividing the vertical distance (V) by the horizontal distance (H), times 100 (= V/H x 100). For example, a parcel of land that is 40 feet in length (H) that rises 10 feet in height (V) has a slope of 25 percent: 10 ;div; 40 x 100 = 25. See Figure 18.24-1. 
Degree of slope is the tangent of the vertical distance divided by the horizontal distance ( = tangent of V/H). See Figure 18.24-1. 
The ratio horizontal distance (run) to vertical distance (rise) can be expressed, for example, as a 4:1 slope where the land has one foot of rise for every four horizontal feet. See Figure 18.24-1.

APPENDIX A: DOWNTOWN RIVERFRONT DESIGN GUIDELINES 

1. - Purpose. 
(a)  These design guidelines provide guidance in terms of more subjective considerations, such as district character, design details, or architectural style. They are intended to assist the public, developers, and design professionals in determining the appearance of new development. The design guidelines also serve as criteria for design review by the city staff, advisory boards, the planning commission and city council. The major sections are as follows: Building form, site improvements and landscaping, signs, and lighting. 
(b)  Standards and guidelines for the Riverfront District promote new buildings and renovations that create a gracious, historical, urban riverfront character, services, and entertainment market niche. Among other things, the standards and guidelines require buildings to define the Truckee Rive Esplanade and adjacent streets as attractive pedestrian spaces, they prohibit blank building walls and parking areas from disrupting frontages, and they require active, ground-floor commercial uses in the district's core blocks. Aspects of the city's impressive architectural heritage-The Riverside Hotel, the historic Main Post Office, the Virginia Street Bridge, the Courthouse, and others - should be used as contextual reference points for all new construction. 
(Ord. No. 5431, § 2, 2-25-03) 
2. - Organization. 
The guidelines are organized in order of increasing level of detail. Diagrams and other graphics are provided to illustrate application of the standards and guidelines. These do not illustrate "required" buildings or other improvements. However, they do illustrate building and improvements that meet the standards and guidelines. 
(Ord. No. 5431, § 2, 2-25-03) 
3. - Applicability of Other Law. 
The City of Reno Master Plan, Zoning Ordinance, Redevelopment Plan, Revitalization Strategy for the Downtown River Corridor, Historic Resources Ordinance, and other policies and regulations also apply within the Riverfront District. All development shall adhere to the building code in effect in the city and the Federal Americans with Disabilities Acts. 
(Ord. No. 5431, § 2, 2-25-03) 
4. - Description of Riverfront District. 
The Riverfront District is one of the City of Reno's most unique and important areas. It is a showcase for the Truckee River, and it is the meeting ground that links the gaming and entertainment core to the north with the governmental and offices core to the south. The Riverfront District combines qualities of both adjacent areas to create a district that is lively yet civic in character. 
(Ord. No. 5431, § 2, 2-25-03) 
FIGURE A-1: DESCRIPTION OF RIVERFRONT DISTRICT 
5. - Building Design Guidelines. 
(a)  Form.   
(1)  The overall form of a building is a function of its three-dimensional characteristics or massing. Discrete building masses should be defined and combined in different ways to create an interesting, attractive composition. For example, a tall, singular mass in the center of a building may be used to define the main entrance; recessed or projecting masses may be used to define building corners or to express interior building functions. 
(2)  In addition, less dramatic forms of surface relief are recommended to add scale to building surfaces. Changes in roof line, window groupings, projected or recessed wall surfaces materials, and/or 
(b)  Storefronts and/or Building Bays. Storefronts and/or building bays should be a maximum of 30 feet and preferably 25 feet in width. Buildings with longer frontages should have a vertical architectural feature - column, pier, etc. - every 25 to 30 feet to reflect the structural bay spacing. 
(c)  Architectural Features. Special architectural features, such as turrets, towers, and loggias should be used to accent buildings at major street comers, at the terminus of a street corridor, lane, or pedestrian way, and at other highly visible district locations. 
(d)  Other Requirements. Every building should have a defined base, a clear pattern of openings and surface features, a recognizable entrance, and an attractive roof line. 
(1)  Building base. This may be as subtle as a small projection of the wall surface combined with different material colors, or as dramatic as a completely different composition and detailing of windows and doorways, combined with different wall surface materials. In general, the building base should be approximately one-third the height of the building. As indicated by the stepback standards under the height and setbacks standards in Section 18.08.303(d) (TRD Truckee River Corridor, Downtown Riverfront Special Purpose District), the base for buildings in the Riverfront District can be designed to incorporate only ground level storefronts, or up to three floors of space. 
FIGURE A-2: BUILDING FACADE DESIGN 
(2)  Openings and surface features. Windows, wall panels, pilasters, and the building's structural bay spacing features should be carried across windowless walls to relieve blank, uninteresting surfaces. 
(3)  Building entrances. Building entrances should be prominent and easy to identify: 
a.  Main building entrances and lobbies should be easily identifiable and distinguishable from first floor storefronts. At least two of the following treatments are recommended: 
1.  Marked by a taller mass above, such as a tower, or within a volume that protrudes or is notched or recessed within the building surface; 
2.  Located in the center of the facade, as part of a symmetrical overall composition; 
3.  Accented by architectural elements, such as columns, overhanging roofs, awnings, and ornamental light fixtures; 
4.  Marked or accented by a change in the roof line or change in the roof type. 
b.  Along "active ground level commercial" frontages entries to businesses, shops or b. lobbies should be located a maximum of 50 feet apart. 
c.  Corner buildings should provide prominent corner entrances for shops, lobbies, and other activity-generating uses. 
FIGURE A-3: BUILDING DESIGN GUIDELINES 
(4)  Roofs and roof lines. Roofs and roof lines should provide visual interest and should complement the overall facade composition. Roofs of historic commercial buildings should be used as an inspiration for new designs. Flat roofs are acceptable if a strong, attractively detailed cornice and/or parapet wall is provided. 
a.  Parapet walls should have a distinct shape or profile, e.g., a gable, arc, or raised center. 
b.  "Commercial mansards" i.e., wraparound roofing panels that do not enclose a habitable floor, should not be used. 
c.  Accent elements such as cutout openings, grilles and latticework, reliefs, or ornamental medallions are recommended. 
d.  Mechanical equipment on rooftops should be screened, preferably behind a parapet roof latticework, louvered panels, and other treatments that are compatible with the building's architecture may also be appropriate. 
(e)  Storefronts. Storefronts are like small buildings with their own base, roof line, and pattern of window and door openings. 
FIGURE A-4: STOREFRONT DESIGN 
(1)  Base. A face panel of stone, precast concrete, tile or other special material is recommended below display windows. Materials recommended for walls are generally suitable. Base materials should be the same or "heavier" materials visually than walls. Ceramic tile is frequently used as a storefront base. 
(2)  Display windows. Large pane windows encompassing a minimum of 60 percent of the storefront surface area are recommended. Where privacy is desired for restaurants, professional services, etc., windows should be divided into smaller panes. 
(3)  Clerestory windows. Clerestory windows are horizontal panels of glass between the storefront and the second floor. They are a traditional element of "main street" buildings, and are recommended for all new or renovated commercial storefronts. Clerestory windows can be good locations for neon, painted-window, and/or other relatively non-obtrusive types of signs. 
(4)  Recessed entries. Recessed entries are recommended as another traditional element of the main street storefront. Recommended treatments include: 
a.  Special paving materials such as ceramic tile; 
b.  Ornamental ceilings such as coffering; 
c.  Decorative light fixtures. 
(5)  Doors. Doors should be substantial and well detailed. They are the one part of the storefront that patrons will invariably touch and feel. They should match the materials, design and character of the display window framing. Narrow line aluminum frame doors must not be used. 
(f)  Side and Rear Building Facades. Side and rear building facades should have a level of trim and finish compatible with the front facade, particularly if they are visible from streets, adjacent parking areas or residential buildings. 
(g)  Blank Wall Areas. Blank wall areas without windows or doors are only permitted on internal block side-property line walls. Such blank walls should reflect the ground level building increment, building massing and organization, and facade compositions guidelines, (e)(1) through (e)(5) above. Surface reliefs, decorative vines, and/or architectural murals, public art, and other surface enhancements should also be considered. 
(h)  Wall Surface Materials.   
(1)  If the building mass and pattern of windows and doors is complex, simple wall surfaces are preferable (e.g., stucco); if the building volume and the pattern of wall openings is simple, additional wall texture and articulation should be employed (e.g. bricks or blocks, rusticated stucco, ornamental reliefs). In both cases, pilasters, columns, and cornices should be used to add visual interest and pedestrian scale. 
(2)  The palette of wall materials should be kept to a minimum, preferably two (e.g. brick and granite), or three at the most. Using the same wall materials as adjacent or nearby buildings helps strengthen the district character. 
a.  Brick - reds, red-browns, or yellow-browns are recommended. 
b.  Stone and stone veneers - are appropriate as a basic building material or as a special material for walls, sills, or base concrete. 
c.  Precast concrete - options in terms of form work, pigments, and aggregates should be explored to create rich surfaces. Accents such as ceramic tile or stone are recommended for decorative effect. 
d.  Ceramic tile - is recommended as an accent material. 
e.  Note on parapet and cornice cap flashings: Sheet metal parapet cap flashings should be painted to match wall or trim color. Select a minimum to avoid "oil canning" distortion in the metal as follows: 24 gauge (galvanized steel); 26 gauge (stainless steel); 0.232-inch (aluminum); 16 ounce (copper). 
f.  Not appropriate: 
1.  Simulated finishes - such as artificial stone. 
2.  Wood - shingles, shakes, clapboard, or plywood siding. 
3.  Concrete or split-face block - unless used on far sides or rear elevations. Concrete or split-face block is not appropriate on adjoining street frontages. 
(i)  Windows. Windows are an important element of building composition and an indicator of overall building quality: 
(1)  Window-to-wall proportion. In general, upper stories should have a window to wall area proportion (typically 30 to 50 percent) that is smaller than that of ground floor storefronts. 
(2)  Window openings. Window openings should generally be vertical or square in shape; if openings are horizontal, windows and/or windowpanes should be square or vertical in shape. 
(3)  Window inset. Window inset glass should be inset a minimum of three inches from the exterior wall surface to add relief to the wall surface; this is especially important for stucco buildings. 
(4)  Shaped frames and sills. Shaped frames and sills should be used to enhance openings and add additional relief. They should be proportional to the glass area framed; e.g. a larger window should have thicker framing members. 
(5)  Muntins. "True divided light" windows or sectional windows are recommended where a divided window design is desired; "snap-in" grilles or muntins are discouraged. 
(6)  Glazing. Clear glazing is strongly recommended. Reflective glazing should not be used. If tinted glazing is used, the tint should be kept as light as possible; green, grey, and blue are recommended. 
(7)  Replacement/renovation. Replacement/renovation - Wood windows should be replaced with wood windows of the same operating type (e.g. double-hung, casement, etc.; vinyl-covered wood windows are available for lower maintenance). If aluminum replacement windows or doors are used, they should be: 
a.  Same operating type and orientation as the original windows (e.g. do not replace a double hung window with a horizontal sliding window). 
b.  Factory painted or fluorocoated to match the original; color anodized is also acceptable. 
c.  Similar in size and thickness to the original frame and mullions. 
FIGURE A-5: WINDOW DESIGN 
(j)  Roof Design and Materials. Roofs should match the principal building in terms of style, detailing and materials. They should also contribute expressive and interesting forms that add to the overall character of the district and are attractive when viewed from surrounding areas. Experimental, severe, and/or non-traditional roof lines or materials should not be used. 
Recommended roof materials are: 
(1)  Clay, ceramic, or concrete tile. Clay, ceramic or concrete tile - Colorful glazed ceramic tiles are recommended for decorative roof shapes, such as parapets, domes, and turrets. 
(2)  Metal seam roofing. Metal seam roofing should be anodized, fluorocoated or painted. Copper and lead roofs should be natural or oxidized. 
(3)  Flat tar and gravel, composition, or elastomeric roofs. Flat tar and gravel, composition, or elastomeric roofs should be screened by built-up cornices, parapets or false-front sections of sloping roof. 
FIGURE A-6: ROOF DESIGN 
(k)  Awnings, Trellises, Canopies, and Accessories.   
(1)  Awnings. Awnings are recommended and subject to redevelopment agency staff review and approval. They should be a colorful fabric that complements and does not detract from the building design. Awnings should be mounted over a metal structural that is framed and attractive in design. Fabric awnings are generally preferable to permanent canopies. Backlit awnings are prohibited. 
(2)  Trellises and canopies. Materials, colors, and form should be derived from the building architecture. 
(3)  Height and projection. Trellises, canopies and awnings valances should be a minimum of seven feet above the sidewalk, and project no more than seven feet out from the building wall. 
(4)  Placement. Placement of trellises, canopies and awnings should be above the display windows and below the storefront cornice or sign panel. They should not cover piers, pilasters, clerestory windows or other architectural features. An individual awning or canopy for each storefront or building bay complements the building more effectively than one continuous awning does. 
(5)  Accessories. Ornamental brackets and poles add interest. Hanging flower or plant baskets suspended from ornamental brackets of metal or wood are recommended for storefronts. 
(l)  Color. In keeping with the formal yet lively character desired for the Riverfront District, color for trim, awnings, and other accessories should accent and contrast wall color; for example, neutral or light wall colors with darker, saturated hues for trim, or warm brick colors with light trim. 
(1)  Secondary color. Secondary color can be used to give additional emphasis to architectural features such as building bases, columns, cornices, capitals, and bands. 
(2)  Bright colors. Bright colors should be used sparingly to allow display windows and merchandise to catch the eye and stand out in the visual field. Typical applications are fabric awnings, banners, window frames, and/or special architectural details. 
(Ord. No. 5431, § 2, 2-25-03) 
6. - Site Improvement Design Guidelines. 
(a)  Paving Materials. Paving materials recommended for pedestrian surfaces are listed below. In general, a maximum of two materials should be combined in a single application: 
(1)  Stone such as slate or granite. 
(2)  Brick. 
(3)  Concrete unit pavers. 
(4)  Poured-in-place concrete with any of the following treatments: integral pigment color; special aggregate; special scoring pattern; ornamental insets, such as tile. All concrete walks should be tinted to reduce glare. 
(b)  Walls, Fences, and Piers. Walls, fences, and piers should be used to define public and private spaces and screen parking areas. 
(1)  Design. Walls, fences, and piers should be designed to reflect the architectural style and materials of the principal building(s). 
a.  Along streets and walks walls and fences should be low and open to maintain an open character and retain visibility. Maximum height for wall and fence panels should be 42 inches. Maximum height for columns and piers should be 54 inches, excluding luminaires, signs, and other appurtenances. 
b.  Fences and wall panels should be divided into regular modules that relate to the architectural module of the principal building(s). 
c.  A combination of thick and thin structural elements - should be used, with thicker elements for supports and/or panel divisions. Fence posts and/or support columns may be built up with additional trim, cornices, and/or moldings for this purpose. 
d.  Walls and piers should have a base and coping. See wall and fence composition diagram. 
e.  Piers - A row of freestanding piers can be effective as an open screen between parking areas and streets or walks. A continuous chain or open metal fence attached between piers can be an attractive device for creating a stronger separation. 
1.  Spacing: no more than ten feet on center. 
2.  Thickness: at least 18 inches per side or diameter. 
3.  Height: at least 36 inches and no taller than 54 inches. 
f.  Riverfront flood walls and retaining walls are highly visible from the Esplanade, Truckee River Bridges, and adjacent buildings. They should be designed as attractive architectural elements. Traditional approaches to detailing should be employed to reflect the design of the Riverfront's attractive older buildings and flood walls; e.g. wall segments should be divided into panels by regularly spaced pilasters and base and top/cornice panels. 
(2)  Materials. Materials should be the same as or compatible with those of the principal building(s). Support post or pier materials may differ from fence materials; e.g. metal fence panels combined with masonry piers. 
a.  Fences should be made of wrought iron, cast iron, and welded steel for commercial applications. Metal fences may be mounted on a low masonry wall, and/or spanning masonry piers. Wood fences should not be used. Metal fences should generally be painted either black or dark green. 
b.  Walls and piers should be made of precast concrete and/or stucco-faced concrete or concrete block, brick, or stone. 
c.  Not recommended: 
1.  Chain link - If used, chain link should be coated with nylon, preferably of a dark color, and used in combination with heavy masonry piers or ornamental metal posts. 
2.  Unfinished or unsurfaced concrete block walls - should not be used. 
3.  Rustic wood fences. 
FIGURE A-7: WALKS, WALLS, AND PIERS 
(c)  Surface Grading. Surface grading should be minimized to maintain a formal and traditional character of development. The following guidelines are recommended: 
(1)  Sheet drainage from building to parking areas and perimeter roadways; 
(2)  No cross slopes in excess of two percent for landscaped or walk areas. Optimum slope for paved areas is one and one-half percent, depending on roughness of paving surface. 
(3)  Mounting earth to elevate buildings, or "berming" earth against the side of buildings is not recommended. 
(d)  The Esplanade.   
(1)  The Esplanade must service a variety of different purposes - shopping, strolling, outdoor dining, low speed bicycling, and just sitting in the sum. It must be a publicly owned and accessible setting that showcases the Truckee River and adjacent buildings to best effect while placing emphasis on the rich historical components found along the river corridor. And accommodate special events and/or emergency access vehicles as needed. A design that is simple, flexible, and elegant is needed to reflect the Riverfront District's rich architectural heritage and history. 
(2)  The elements listed below are recommended as part of the Esplanade design, whether the Esplanade is developed by the City of Reno directly, or through agreements with developers as part of new private development projects. The sketch plan, Figure A-8 (Esplanade Furnishings), illustrates the recommended design concept. 
a.  Cross-section. 
A minimum width of 25 feet as measured from the face of the riverfront retaining wall is recommended, as noted elsewhere. This 25-foot area should be organized according to functions listed below and illustrated by the "concept plan" below. 
1.  Storefront display/dining zone. 
A public area a minimum of six feet in width should be established adjacent to the building frontage. This area would be used for window-shopping, and subject to the redevelopment agency's review and approval, outdoor dining, merchandise displays and "sidewalk sales." 
2.  Central promenade. 
An area a minimum of 12 feet in width shall be reserved in the center of the Esplanade for strolling, low-speed bicycling, special events, and emergency vehicle access. 
3.  Furnishings zone. 
An area a minimum of six feet in width adjacent to the river edge should be reserved for shade tree, benches, trash, receptacles, and/or other furnishings as set forth below. 
4.  River edge fence/wall. 
An area approximately one foot in width should be reserved for an attractive fence/wall with integral pedestrian lighting. 
b.  Paving pattern and materials. 
Patterns should be form and materials simple; a maximum of three materials should be used in combination. Patterns and materials should reflect the three major functional areas described above. A large-scale yet subtle pattern is recommended for the Central Promenade; material should be scored, tinted, concrete. A smaller-scale pattern and/or material is recommended as a border for use in the display/dining and furnishings zones; material should be concrete or granite pavers, brick, or scored concrete. 
c.  Furnishings. 
Furnishings should be civil in appearance, heavy-duty in construction, and arranged to reflect the formal qualities desired for the Esplanade. It is recommended that benches, trash receptacles, lighting and trees, be arranged to create a series of defined sitting areas. Open, unfurnished areas should be created at regular intervals to allow for groups to stand adjacent to the fence/wall, for set of special exhibits and displays, and for additional maneuvering room for vehicles. Recommended furnishings are show on the graphic. It is also recommended that public art be incorporated into furnishings whenever possible. 
d.  Trees and lighting. 
Deciduous shade trees and pedestrian-scale lighting should be installed at regular intervals to create a formal Esplanade edge. Lights should be installed at a relatively narrow spacing to create a well-illuminated nighttime environment. It is recommended that trees and lights alternate every 20 feet; i.e. trees would be located at 40 feet on the center and lights would be located at 40 feet on center. 
e.  River edge fence/wall. 
The Virginia Street Bridge should serve as the model for design of the fence/wall along the river edge. Regularly spaced concrete pilasters and a continuous base should frame ornamental metal fence panels. Pilasters should be detailed and serve as basis for the Esplanade lighting. The railing design employed for the Virginia Street Bridge should be used throughout the Esplanade. 
(Ord. No. 5431, § 2, 2-25-03) 
FIGURE A-8: ESPLANADE FURNISHINGS 
7. - Landscaping Design Guidelines. 
(a)  Because the Riverfront District is one of the city's most visible and highly-developed areas, plant materials should be colorful and sized for immediate effect; e.g. trees should be installed at a minimum 36-inch box and/or three-inch caliper size. 
(b)  Plant materials along streets should create an attractive and harmonious character, in keeping with the Downtown location. 
(1)  Street trees should be planted between sidewalks and roadways to create a buffer between pedestrians and automobiles. Consistency in tree species, tree size, and spacing should be used to reinforce a strong street identity and character. 
(2)  Trees with open branching structures should be used. Deciduous trees are recommended. 
(3)  Planting/landscapes areas should have a simple palette of plant species. 
(4)  Complex planting scheme should not be used in front yard areas. 
(5)  Plant materials that exhibit annual or seasonal color are recommended to highlight special locations, such as main building entrances and entrance walks. 
(c)  Plant materials in other urban locations should be selected and placed to reflect both ornamental and functional characteristics. 
(1)  Deciduous trees should be the predominant large plant material used. They should be located adjacent to buildings and within parking areas to provide shade in summer and allow sun in winter. Species should be selected to provide fall color, and to minimize litter and other maintenance problems. 
(2)  Evergreen shrubs and trees should be used as a screening device along rear property lines (not directly adjacent to residences), around mechanical appurtenances, and to obscure grillwork and fencing associated with subsurface parking garages. 
(3)  Flowering shrubs and trees should be used where they can be most appreciated, adjacent to walks and recreational areas, or as a frame for building entrances, stairs, and walks. 
(4)  Flowers with annual or seasonal color are recommended to highlight special locations, such as courtyards, building entrances, or access drives. 
(d)  Native riparian species and arrangements should be used in river-edge areas where earthen banks rather than flood walls define the river channel. Species should be informal in appearance and open in form to maintain views to the river. 
(e)  Surface parking lots utilize a significant amount of site area and should be designed as an integral feature of the overall site development plan. 
(1)  Space-defining elements such as trellises, columns, walls, arbors, and hedges should be provided to enhance the appearance of lots. These elements should be consistent in design and materials with the principal building(s) and other site features. 
(2)  "Orchard parking" should be employed in all surface lots. Trees shall be planted toward the rear of parking stalls to create a grid rather than rows, at a ratio of one tree per three cars. The "orchard" tree placement provides better shade on the passenger compartment and more even shade and vegetation throughout the parking area. 
(Ord. No. 5431, § 2, 2-25-03) 
8. - Sign Design Guidelines. 
(a)  Location and Size. Location and size are subject to redevelopment agency review and approval. 
(1)  Signs should be mounted on parapets, towers, turrets, recessed wall areas, and other architectural features specifically designed for them. Flush-mounted and painted wall signs should align with major architectural elements, such as doors and windows. Ornamental elements, such as moldings, pilasters, arches, clerestory windows, roof eaves, or cornice lines should be used as a frame. 
(2)  Signs should not span cornice or eave lines. However, signs designed as an extension of the architectural form of the building may be appropriate. For example, projecting signs, signboards or neon signs may be designed to look like a marquee, parapet, or accent to a parapet or sloped roof. 
(3)  Signs should be in proportion to the size of building they identify. The sum total of building-mounted signs (excluding window signs) used to identify an individual use should not exceed one square foot of area for each linear foot of the building frontage occupied by that use. 
(b)  Architectural Design.   
(1)  Sign shapes, type styles, and color combinations should complement building styles. In the Riverfront District it is recommended that buildings have a formal character and signs project a complementary look; the large-scale neon and flashing lights associated with signs in the gaming core would detract from the character desired for the Riverfront District. 
(2)  Structural supports should complement the overall design of the sign and/or building. Ornamental metal is strongly recommended. Guy wires shall be avoided. 
(3)  Awning signs should appear and function primarily as awnings, however. Awnings should reflect the buildings module and should not extend for more than 25 linear feet without a break. Signs on canopies should be integrated with the canopy fascia, or be in the form of freestanding letters mounted on top and extending above the fascia. 
(4)  Projecting signs are recommended if designed as architectural features (see above) and/or located primarily for pedestrian visibility; minimum sidewalk clearance should be seven feet. 
(5)  Internally illuminated "canned" signs should not be used. Canned signs look and often are mass-produced, making businesses look generic. 
(6)  Materials should be long-lasting. Recommended materials are: 
a.  Signboards should be dimensional in nature and of wood or metal, with painted, engraved or routed letters, or mounted letters of wood or metal. 
b.  Silhouette or figurative signs three-dimensional letters, symbols, and/or ornamental figures made of wood or metal. 
c.  Custom neon exterior-mounted on a signboard or metal support frame or enclosure, or interior-mounted behind clerestory or display windows. 
d.  Fabric awnings such as canvas or nylon, with painted or applied lettering; plastic awnings that have high gloss or a reflective appearance shall not be used. Undersides of awnings should have a finished appearance with no exposed lighting or framework visible from the underside. 
(7)  Lighting. 
Lighting should be used to enhance both signs and buildings. When possible, sign illumination should be coordinated with an overall building lighting scheme. Recommended lighting approaches are: 
a.  Backlit - with lighting inside and behind projecting lettering and/or awnings. 
b.  Floodlit - with single or multiple spotlights, provided light sources are shielded to protect motorists, pedestrians, and adjacent properties. 
c.  Color and lamp type - Light sources providing the most pleasing and accurate color rendering are metal halide, incandescent, and color-corrected fluorescent. Other lamp types, such as cool white fluorescent, mercury vapor, and high and low pressure sodium may distort sign colors and should be used according to advice from a lighting professional; these lamp types are not appropriate for area lighting. 
(Ord. No. 5431, § 2, 2-25-03) 
9. - Lighting Design Guidelines 
(a)  Area Lighting. Light sources for illuminating sidewalks, passageways, parking areas, rear and side yard areas, and common areas shall be maintained in operable condition and remain illuminated during the evening and nighttime hours; and: 
(1)  Shall be shielded - from casting light higher than 15 degrees below the horizontal plane, as measured from the light source. They shall not cast light directly into adjacent residential windows; a translucent or optical lens diffuser globe or shield is recommended. (The Esplanade is a special condition; see below.) 
(2)  Maximum mounting height - of light sources for ground level illumination shall be 14 feet, measured from the finished grade of the area to be lit. 
(3)  Low pressure sodium lighting - should not be used. 
(b)  Ornamental Fixtures. Ornamental fixtures are fixtures not used as primary area lighting and mounted with visible light sources: 
(1)  With clear or no diffuser. Individual lamp wattage should not exceed 60 watts incandescent, 20 watts fluorescent, or 40 watts high intensity discharge (H.I.D., such as metal halide, high pressure sodium, or mercury vapor lamps). 
(2)  With frosted or optical (fresnel type) diffuser. Individual lamp wattage may not exceed 100 watts incandescent, 40 watts fluorescent, or 70 watts H.I.D. 
(3)  Replacement fixtures. Replacement fixtures - should be readily available. 
(c)  Special Condition: The Esplanade. The following recommendations are intended to promote an attractive nighttime pedestrian environment. They apply to lighting installations by either the private or public sector. 
(1)  Recommended lamp color/types. Metal halide (3,000 degrees K.), color-corrected ("white") high pressure sodium (HPS), color-corrected fluorescent (2,700 3,000 degrees K), incandescent. 
(2)  Lamps not appropriate. Tandard ("peach") high pressure sodium, low pressure sodium, standard mercury vapor, cool white fluorescent. 
(3)  Metalwork. Metalwork portions of lighting should be architecturally related to the building architecture. Color and finish of lighting metalwork should harmonize with the building's metalwork, if any. 
(4)  Recommended lens. Clear borosilicate glass globes, clear acrylic or polycarbonate globes with optical diffusing (fresnel) patterns, translucent clear (frosted) or white acrylic or polycarbonate globes. 
(5)  Lens types not appropriate. Clear or tinted, smooth finish acrylic or polycarbonate globes (they tend to show scratches and wear after several years). 
(6)  Fence/wall lighting. Recommended lamps, fixtures, and location are: 100 W/3,000 K metal halide lamps; traditional white globe lens, approx. 18-inch diameter; 12-foot to 13-foot mounting height; spacing at 40 feet on center. Lights are recommended to be mounted on wall pilasters; however if this is not feasible, light standards should be installed with the same spacing and specifications listed above.

APPENDIX B - SKYWAY DESIGN GUIDELINES 
Contents

APPENDIX B: SKYWAY DESIGN GUIDELINES 
The following skyway design guidelines are adopted in order to provide design standards for skyways. These guidelines may be amended only after a public hearing by the planning commission and adoption of a resolution by the city council. 

1. - Purpose and Intent. 
Skyways provide an opportunity to increase the economic viability of a project. The short block lengths that exist in downtown Reno make it difficult to provide large-scale projects to strengthen Reno's economy. In addition, properly designed skyways may provide for improved traffic flow, increased pedestrian safety and increased pedestrian comfort. Finally, skyways provide an additional revenue source for the City of Reno. 
These skyway design guidelines are intended to cover "normal" situations encountered in design. It is expected that architectural and engineering considerations will arise which are not completely covered. Therefore, any items or situations not anticipated in the Guidelines will be designed in accordance with accepted architectural and engineering practices and appropriate codes and ordinances. It is anticipated that unusual or extraordinary situations will arise given the complexities involved. In such cases, the administrator may authorize alternative standards, provided that any alternative standard meets the intent or are the equivalent of the skyway design guidelines and are in accordance with accepted architectural and engineering practices. Meeting the requirements of this section does not guarantee approval of a skyway. The burden of proof is on the applicant to demonstrate that a skyway is essential for the project and meets or exceeds the Design Guidelines. 
The purpose of the following document is to provide the technical basis for the review of skyways provided for under Article XX of Chapter 18.12 of this title, and to provide design professionals with criteria intended to promote orderly development and integration of skyway structures into new or existing built environments. Where specific quantitative standards are presented, they shall be treated as minimums that can only be proposed for change with explicit justification in the project's special use permit application. Skyways offer innovative solutions for creating new space in the high-density downtown urban core, or offering safe access to land separated by rights-of-way in other suburban areas. These guidelines recognize that bridging over rights-of-way can be problematic. The criteria here represent a foundation of what is to be expected from the design professional in maintaining continuity of quality of skyway projects. These guidelines serve as a baseline for the thoughtful evolvement of skyways. 
2. - Participation Property Frontage Percentage for Skybuildings. 
If a property is located in an area identified as appropriate for skybuildings, a property owner(s) who has gained control over an entire block or the majority of a block and still needs more land for expansion, may need to link two or more blocks to achieve economic benefit. If 75 percent of the street frontage property owners of a block proposed for a skyway agree to the proposal, then it can be assumed that the applicant has met finding (10)d. of Section 18.06.405(e). A total of 75 percent participation is defined as a minimum of 75 percent of the total street frontage counting both sides of the street. 
Example: If the street frontage of the block is 300 feet long, then the participating property frontage percentage requirement would be 300 feet plus 300 feet for a total of 600 feet x 75%, or 450 feet of street frontage.  
3. - Railroad Corridor. 
For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: 
(a)  Downtown Railroad Corridor. The area adjacent to and including the Southern Pacific Railroad right-of-way and the air space above it, with a width equal to the distance from the north boundary of the right-of-way for Third Street (between Sierra Street and Arlington Avenue) and the south boundary of the right-of-way for Commercial Row (between Virginia Street and Sierra Street), and bounded on the east and west by the boundaries of the Redevelopment Area. 
(b)  Interior Railroad Tunnel. The area within which the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks are entirely enclosed on both sides and above, and not visible from adjacent public areas including streets, sidewalks or other properties. The terminus of the tunnel at each end for a minimum depth of 20 feet (visible from adjacent streets and sidewalks) shall be excluded from this provision to ensure that an aesthetic treatment compatible with the exterior is provided. 
4. - Architectural Compatibility. 
Architectural compatibility is the most important element of the design guidelines. Healthy, growing cities are constantly evolving and architectural creativity should not be restricted if the city is to experience orderly development. Encouragement of design compatibility with adjacent land based structures will help to ensure diversity and interest in the structures that are built. Restricting design to rigid criteria could lead to "cookie cutter" structures where one corner or area looks much like the one two blocks away. 
Each skyway setting will undoubtedly be unique in character and scale. In a tourist-oriented market where creative competition for patron interest is important, many architectural styles will develop. Contemporary/futuristic, historical, classical, as well as whimsical and fantasy styles may need to co-exist. 
5. - Street Level Activity Opportunity and Public Space. 
(a)  Human activity at street level is vital to the atmosphere of a city. In order to encourage this activity, facade improvements beneath skybuildings are required. Specifically, an architectural facade change, that includes recessed sections, is required every 25 lineal feet of building frontage on a block that includes a skybuilding. Additionally, transparent openings into a public commercial space are also required every 75 lineal feet, adjacent to the right-of-way or a public space. This is considered a minimum standard unless the skyway design includes both a functional basis for the deviation and the applicant demonstrates that the proposed design is "pedestrian friendly", given the particular context. This area should provide opportunity for commercial and public activity such as street vendors, project entrances, street furniture and focal points for architectural features or public art. 
(b)  In order to encourage street level activity and maintain open space at the intersections which will provide more light and air, a public space requirement for skybuildings attached to new terminus building(s) is established, outside at ground level. Skybuildings attached to new terminus building(s) require a 4:1 ratio of skybuilding square footage area to additional ground level public space, outside the right-of-way, within the same block and located at the corners of the building in order to provide open space that helps replace the admittance of light and air that may be eliminated by the skybuilding. If the property owner can demonstrate that it is impossible to provide additional public space at the corner, then the public space setback may be used to provide wider sidewalks under the skybuilding or some other design solution such as a Porte cohere private driveway. The additional public space applies to that portion of the terminus building that is a minimum of 20 feet, or below the skybuilding, whichever is higher. The portion of the terminus building that is below the skybuilding, at a minimum 20 feet, may cantilever back out to its permitted setback. (Figure B-1). 
FIGURE B-1: PUBLIC SPACE REQUIREMENT 
(c)  Within the Downtown Railroad Corridor, the design review committee shall determine the appropriate requirement of ground level public space in relation to skybuilding square footage area in lieu of the 4:1 public space to skybuilding area requirement. 
(d)  When a skyway is proposed to be located closer than 25 feet from the nearest right-of-way, excluding alleys, then in addition to the landscaping and screening provisions stated in Article XII of Chapter 18.12, additional landscaping shall be provided on the roof, cantilevered over the facade or a combination of both. The additional landscaping should be designed to soften the effect of the structure that will be located next to the open space provided at the intersections. 
6. - Design. 
(a)  A primary objective of the recommendations given throughout this text is to achieve continuity in the design of new skybuildings constructed between existing or new building facades. Often, the skyway will infill between two parallel building frontages. These buildings may have been designed during different architectural or historical periods and thus when compared are unique and distinctly different. The degree of difference which exists between any given building will require an equal degree of effort to design a skyway which will visually connect the supporting buildings' exterior facades. Effort should be made to incorporate facade improvements on both buildings that will receive a connecting skyway so that they will have complementary facades before the skyway is constructed. 
(b)  Skyway design must meet ADA, building code, and Fire Code requirements. Additionally, skyway design shall meet NFPA 502 (1992, as amended). 
(c)  Steps to achieve continuity include a careful analysis of the architectural components that comprise the facades under consideration. Within any building elevation there will be design elements that predominate and visually suggest the overall character of the building. These elements should be considered as the fundamental, design components. Design components include the following: 
(1)  Building massing. 
(2)  Roof lines/cornices. 
(3)  Facade-breakup/rhythm. 
(4)  Wall surface materials, texture and decorative elements. 
(5)  Fenestration (windows). 
(6)  Door openings. 
(7)  Color. 
(8)  Lighting. 
(9)  Bridge support structures and services. 
(d)  When designing the exterior facade for skyways, include design components found on the exterior of the adjacent supporting buildings. In most cases, these architectural components will not exist on both buildings. Because of this, it is important to select design components for the skyway and connecting buildings which will be the most effective in creating a cohesive project with an overall appearance of integrity. Skyways should also be designed to be compatible with the historical architectural patterns and elements of the block in which they are to reside. Whatever design components are used to bridge two buildings, it is imperative that the designer uses the best visual sensibility and continuity. For example, if both buildings contain vertical columns, then the skyway design should also include vertical columns, or if one building contains vertical columns, vertical columns might be added to both the existing building and the proposed skyway. 
7. - Building Massing. 
(a)  The overall massing of the skyway shall be harmonious with the buildings that form terminals at each end. Skyway design must reduce the "tunnel effect" which gives the impression of entering a tunnel. In an effort to reduce or eliminate the "tunnel effect", unless explicit justification is presented in the applicant's special use permit application to deviate from this standard, all skyways shall maintain a 20-foot minimum clearance above the right-of-way. Where only new structures are involved, the 20-foot clearance is viewed as a true minimum, unless particularly unique circumstances are present. This clearance will reduce the narrow separation between the street and the bottom of the skyway that is typical of the existing skyways which may appear to have a "tunnel effect". In order to encourage greater clearances, skyway design shall include a 1:1 ratio of clear height between the right-of-way and the skyway, to overall height of the skyway structure. For example, if a skyway is 20 feet above the right-of-way, then the skyway structure height shall be limited to 20 feet overall height. If, however, a 22-foot tall skyway structure is desired, then the minimum height above the right-of-way shall be 22 feet (Figure B-2). 
FIGURE B-2: SKYWAY CLEARANCE GUIDELINES 
(b)  Within the Downtown Railroad Corridor, the design review committee shall determine the appropriate proportion of skybuilding height to clear height above the Interior Railroad Tunnel in lieu of the maximum ratio of 1:1 of required skybuilding to street opening or clearance below. 
(c)  The width of a skyway is another contributing factor of "tunnel effect'. In order to reduce the impact that width has on this phenomenon, a skybuilding's underside, facades and lighting shall receive particular attention to details. Where permitted, skybuildings may not cover more than 80 percent of the area between two streets, with particular attention being given to conserving open space at the intersections. The Downtown Railroad Corridor is exempted from the 80 percent maximum coverage. No skybuildings may be placed over the intersection of two streets. Skybuildings may require setbacks from intersecting streets to address Reno Fire Department requirements and/or air and light needs for pedestrians and the streetscape. Applicants should meet with the fire department early in the design process to establish its needs. 
(d)  The 30-foot maximum width for pedestrian skywalks should reduce the appearance of a massive bulk above the right-of-way, which is typical of wider skybuildings. The use of roof top or cantilevered landscaping is encouraged to soften the effect of the skyway, especially if the proposed skyway will be closer than 25 feet from the right-of-way. 
(e)  Lighting is a key factor to reduce the "tunnel effect". To this end, the lighting beneath a skybuilding should be brighter during daylight hours and softer during hours of darkness. Additionally, the ceiling should be illuminated to reduce the contrast between the recessed lights and the dark ceiling. Ideally, the ceiling will be illuminated indirectly, with uplighting, for a strong architectural effect. Specific recommendations are given in the lighting section. 
8. - Roof Line/Cornices. 
For the most part, roof lines on commercial building structures are flat with parapets. On the other hand, cornice elements can be diverse and occur at tops of buildings or midpoints. Cornices can be very dominant elements that create strong definitions of the beginning and end portions of a building and as such must be used thoughtfully. When using cornices, overall design must create an artful blending of the two buildings with the skyway. For instance if a unique roof line or cornice found on supporting building "A" is incorporated onto the facade of the connecting skyway, it will be necessary to develop a portion of this same component on supporting building "B". Continuation of architectural components on both buildings provides smooth transition between structures. 
9. - Facade-Breakup/Rhythm. 
In order to break up the monotony of the facade, the design must incorporate architectural features of the supporting buildings to the skyway facades. The skyway should be consistent from one side of the structure to the other to ensure a continuity of look, feel and balance. Continuity of style should also include a combination of motifs, using horizontal as well as vertical elements, color, texture, lighting, etc. 
10. - Wall Surface Materials and Texture. 
Reno has many examples of traditional uses of brick materials. Should this material be incorporated onto a skyway, it must appear to be structural masonry. A designer should also consider how natural and artificial light plays upon the wall and ceiling surfaces of the structure. If depth of surface is desired, this may be achieved with color contrasts, material contrasts, applied or structural elements that create shadow, vertical or horizontal reveals, and any other design element that will eliminate a "blank wall" effect. The existing surface materials and textures of the terminus buildings must be incorporated onto the skyway facades. If the existing materials or textures on the existing buildings are dissimilar and visually conflicting, then the use of a neutral existing material or texture found on either terminus building should help ease the transition. The finish materials on the exterior should complement the character of the connecting buildings. 
11. - Windows. 
(a)  This component has many elements that define its appearance. It includes, but is not be limited to, frame type, directional orientation (whether it is more vertical or horizontal or otherwise), glass type, spacing and trim. The complexity of this component together with the possibility that the supporting buildings may have dissimilar fenestration necessitates considering a number of schemes to create continuity. 
(b)  In order to allow pedestrians and drivers to see into the skyways, a minimum transparency is required, 25 percent minimum transparency is required for skybuildings (Figure B-3). In order to ensure "see through" windows or transparent sections, these transparent windows or sections shall be made of material that has a minimum of 52 percent visual light transmittance with a six percent maximum visual light reflectance. Pedestrian skywalks and skytrams shall maintain at least 70 percent (for all skytrams and for skywalks greater than 20 feet in width) or 50 percent (for skywalks less than or equal to 20 feet in width) transparent windows or sections depending on the width of the skywalk or skytram. In any case, the transparent windows or sections shall maintain the same minimum 52 percent visual light transmittance and maximum six percent visual light reflectance as skybuildings. Transparency for skytrams takes into consideration the overall height of structure with the skytram in place. If it is not an enclosed structure, credit will be given for the open portion of the overall height. 
(c)  If there is extreme diversity in the two buildings' windows, a fenestration system for the skyway may be a composite of both buildings' window types. Skyway fenestration may be a simplified interpretation, suggesting rather than replicating the supporting buildings fenestration. 
12. - Door Openings. 
Street/sidewalk access and exit to and from skybuildings and pedestrian skyways must be apparent and inviting to the public. Two way access to skyways, located within a building, should not exceed 50 feet of travel from the exterior face of the building to the point of entry to the skyway vertical access where practical. The sidewalk access should be transparent so that the skyway access point is clearly visible from the sidewalk and is identified by signage that is also clearly visible and readable from the sidewalk. Skyway access must meet ADA, building code, and Fire Code requirements. If a skyway is closed for any reason, a sign displaying the hours of the closure must be located at the ground floor level entrance to the skyway. 
13. - Color. 
In order to lessen the effect of being in a tunnel, pale off-whites or light colors should comprise the majority of solid surfaces. Colors used closer to the street level should be lighter in color because this will appear to "lift" the structure. Corporate colors should be limited and used as an accent color. 
14. - Lighting. 
(a)  Interior lighting seen through pedestrian skywalk and skytram fenestration shall be inconspicuous, non-glare, non-animated and cannot pose a traffic hazard. Interior lighting seen through skybuilding fenestration, in the Downtown Area Overlay District, shall be inconspicuous, non-glare, and may be animated provided it is not deemed to be a traffic hazard. Access corridor lighting, to the skyway, shall be brighter than the skyway lighting to provide better visibility. When lighting is used as a design element, it should be used consistently throughout the project, including the skyway. Lighting of the skyway should be designed in harmony and balance with the entire structure. Lighting which adds importance or prominence to the skyway is not permitted if it could make the skyway become a distraction or cause confusion to pedestrian or vehicular traffic (i.e., flashing, glaring lighting must be avoided). 
FIGURE B-3: SKYBUILDING TRANSPARENCY 
(b)  Exterior lighting and indirect surface lighting on the exterior of the skyway is acceptable and encouraged so that skyway structures will not look like heavy dark shapes in the night sky. The ceiling, beneath the skyway, must be lighted either directly or indirectly. Indirect lighting, through the use of uplighting, is recommended. The exterior lighting should reduce the contrast between the lights installed to illuminate the right-of-way beneath the skyway and the dark ceiling. Lighting of the right-of-way, beneath a skybuilding, is required. This lighting shall maintain a minimum of 30 footcandle of light during daylight hours, and ten foot candle of light during hours of darkness, measured at three feet above grade. Metal halide lights are required. 
(c)  Where possible, natural lighting should be used in addition to external non-glare and inconspicuous artificial light to mitigate possible "tunnel effects" below the skyways. 
15. - Bridge Support Structure and Services. 
(a)  Bridge support structures that support the skyway at either end should be contained within the terminus buildings or incorporated into the design of pedestrian ways or sidewalks. If the support structures are to be located within the right-of-way, then the developer shall first obtain an encroachment permit or shall abandon the right-of-way (at the city's discretion) and shall replace the lost right-of-way at a 1:1 ratio for the entire support structure, including footings. The right-of-way replacement shall be located on the same street frontage as the skyway. Ideally, the support structures will be offset with an area for a wider sidewalk and/or space for a porte cochere. In any case, additional public space should be designed so that it will not become unused space that is unattractive to pedestrians. 
(b)  Within the Downtown Railroad Corridor, the design review committee shall determine the appropriate proportion of right-of-way encroachment to replacement of public space in lieu of the ratio of 1:1 of required right-of-way encroachment to right-of-way replacement. 
(c)  Skyway support structures shall be screened and shielded from view unless they are integral to the design. The design of support structures should be architecturally stimulating and comprised of architectural columns or public art, for example. 
(d)  Bridge services are defined as those electrical and mechanical systems that exhaust airborne pollutants and provide electrical service to exterior lights necessary for safe passage below the skyway. If necessary, mechanical ventilation of the area below skyway shall be installed. A carbon monoxide control system shall be required, unless the designer can demonstrate through studies or tests that carbon monoxide will not be a hazard. Ventilation and lighting of the public space covered by skyways shall be powered and metered independently so as to provide for continuous service to the public at large. Skyways must not interfere or impair use of the public right-of-way by existing or proposed communication and utility facilities. 
(e)  Skyways shall be designed to meet all streetlight and traffic signal requirements and the right-of-way beneath the skyway shall be designed so that traffic is not impeded. In order to minimize accumulated exhaust, buses, taxis and delivery vehicles will not be permitted to idle beneath skyways. 
(f)  Roof drainage systems shall provide year-round continuous drainage to adjoining building systems or to the storm sewer and shall operate independent of the operation of the attached buildings. 
16. - Support Structures for Detached Vertical Access to Pedestrian Skywalks and Skytrams. 
Support structures for detached vertical access to pedestrian skywalks and skytrams must meet the setbacks required in the zone in which they are located. These structures must also meet the minimum requirements for transparency and should be designed to minimize the appearance of visual clutter beside the roadway. These structures must also meet ADA, Fire Code, and building code requirements. 
17. - Signs. 
(a)  Signage should not dominate the skyway facade, rather it should complement the existing buildings and overall design of the skyway. Signage shall also be proportional to the scale of the skyway structure. Outside the Downtown Core area, signs shall be limited to one corporate logo or one company name per side, in addition to directional signs required by the city and/or permitted by the administrator. 
(b)  In the Downtown Redevelopment Area, skyways should use signs in a manner that complements the architecture and sign design of the primary structure(s) in scale, proportion, colors and materials. Signs should not create hazardous conditions for motorists due to excessive glare through flashing or animated signs or other obstructions. The quality and design/architectural relationship of signs is more important than the amount or quantity of signs. All skyway signs should generally be of a permanent rather than temporary nature (e.g., banners). Banners or seasonal material (such as Christmas decorations) should be durable and of high quality. 
(c)  Reader boards are prohibited because they could interfere with traffic. 
18. - Design Review Committee. 
(a)  A design review committee shall review skyway proposals. 
(b)  The design review committee shall be comprised of the following principal voting members: 
(1)  One recommended by the Nevada Chapter of the American Planning Association; and 
(2)  One recommended by the Nevada Chapter of the American Institute of Architects; and 
(3)  One recommended by the Nevada Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects; and 
(4)  One recommended by the planning commission; and 
(5)  One recommended by the citizens advisory committee for the redevelopment agency. 
Each of the above shall also recommend an alternate. The alternate will be a voting member when the principal member is absent. 
(c)  The design review committee (D.R.C.) will review skyway plans to ensure a public perspective is provided related to conformance with the intent of the skyway design guidelines. It is recommended that an applicant hold a "pre-application" hearing with the D.R.C., prior to formal submittal of a "major" special use permit application. Prior to appearing before the planning commission, the skyway plans and drawings will be presented to the D.R.C. for their formal review.
