income which shall report as separate items their estimate of the total expense for each special
service, their estimate of any anticipated contributions by the State and Federal governments,
their estimate of any income from charges for the furnishing of such special service and the
estimated portion of such expense to be raised by taxation. The Town at the annual Town
Meeting shall appropriate such amount for each special service as may be necessary to defray the
estimated expense thereof. Any unexpended balance of an appropriation for a special service
shall be placed in a separate capital reserve fund for such service or shall be applied to reduce the
appropriation for such service as the voters shall under an article in the warrant determine.
[Amended, 1965; eff. 4/1/66.]

5
taxes to defray a part or all of the expense of providing certain special services shall be
established in the Town. No later than February 1st of the year following that in which this act is
adopted, the Selectmen shall prepare and make available for public inspection a map or maps of
the Town or a written description of each proposed special service area. Within forty-five days
thereafter the Selectmen shall hold a public hearing upon the recommendations of area
boundaries made by them. After such hearing and after any revisions or adjustments which the
Selectmen may deem proper, such areas shall become effective for the purposes of this act.
Changes in area lines shall be made by the Selectmen from time to time as a result of the change
in nature of the property in the area or the services provided. Such changes may be made by the
Selectmen upon thirty days written notice of the proposed change being sent first class mail to
the last known address on the tax rolls of the owners of each of the properties affected. Such
changes shall be effective without hearing unless written objection thereto is filed with the Town
Clerk or with one of the Selectmen within such thirty day period. If such an objection is filed,
the Selectmen shall postpone the effective date of the change until at least ten days after the date
of hearing. However, if such postponement shall delay the effective date until after April first of
any year the area line as revised shall be effective retroactive to March thirty-first of such year.
Section 13. Taxes for Special Services. The net amount to be raised by taxation for each
special service shall be assessed against the owners of property in each special service area or
areas as provided in this act. For such purpose the Selectmen shall establish a separate inventory
for the purpose of assessment of taxes of the property in each special service area. The inventory
of property in the sewer area and the inventory of property in the sidewalk area shall include only
real property and not personal property. The inventory of property in the fire protection area
shall include both real and personal property. Such taxes shall be otherwise assessed and
collected in the same manner as taxes on property for other purposes and each property owner
shall have the same rights of abatement and appeal with respect to the taxes for special services
as he does for taxes on property for other purposes. If, for any reason, funds raised by special
taxes, charges or otherwise are insufficient to pay the principal of or interest on any bonds, notes
or other evidences of indebtedness issued for special services, the Town shall have the power to
levy unlimited ad valorem taxes on all taxable property in the Town to pay the principal of and
interest on said bonds, notes or evidences of indebtedness; and such indebtedness shall be the
general obligation of the Town of Hanover. [Amended, 1965; amended, 1975 N.H. Laws, Ch.
296:1.]
Section 14. Fire Protection.
I. Fire Protection Areas. The Selectmen shall divide the entire Town into
two or more fire protection areas in proportion to the fire protection afforded to property owners
within each area. In allocating property to each area, the Selectmen shall take into account in
addition to all other relevant factors:
a. The distance of each property from a hydrant and the pressure at the
hydrant.
b. The distance of each property from a fire station.
6
c. Such other relevant standards currently applied by the New Hampshire
Board of Underwriters as the Selectmen may deem applicable.
II. Fire Protection Expense. The estimated net expense for fire protection
shall be allocated by the Selectmen in their budget among the various fire protection areas and
raised by special taxes assessed against all real and personal property in each area on such basis
as the Selectmen shall determine reasonably and equitably reflects the benefits received. In
making such determination the Selectmen shall take into account the current cost of fire
insurance in each fire protection area in addition to all other relevant factors on real and personal
property. [Amended, 1965.]
Section 15. Sewage Disposal Expense.
a. The Selectmen shall establish a sewage disposal area which shall comprise all
that part of the Town in which public or private sewer service is available.
b. The entire expense of sewage disposal shall be met by sewer rentals as herein
provided. The Selectmen shall establish a scale of rates to be called sewer rents and prescribe the
manner in which and the time at which such rents are to be paid, and shall have the power to
change such scale from time to time as may be deemed advisable. Such rents may be based upon
either the metered consumption of water on premises connected with the sewer system, taking
into consideration as the Selectmen deemed necessary the commercial use of water, the number
or kind of plumbing fixtures connected with the sewer system or the number of persons served by
said sewage disposal system or upon any other equitable basis. In addition, the Selectmen may
establish reasonable connection fees, extension charges and allowances on account of new users
of the sewage disposal system. All of such sewage disposal charges shall become a lien upon the
real estate benefitted thereby and such lien may be enforced by a suit on behalf of the Town
ordered by the Selectmen against the owner or owners of such real estate. The record in the
office of the Selectmen or superintendent of public works and the charges for service furnished
as aforesaid shall be sufficient notice to maintain suit upon such lien against subsequent
purchasers or attaching creditors of such real estate.
c. The Selectmen shall apply against the total appropriation for sewage disposal
expense in each year the anticipated State and Federal aid during such period and shall raise the
balance from the sewage disposal charges as above provided. [Amended, 1977 N.H. Laws, Ch.
348:2.]
Section 16. [Repealed, 1977 N.H. Laws, Ch. 348:3]
Section 17. Sidewalks.
I. Sidewalk Area. The Selectmen shall establish a sidewalk area which shall
comprise all that part of the Town served by public sidewalks. A piece of property whether
improved or unimproved shall be deemed to be served by a public sidewalk when it either abuts a
sidewalk or is found by the Selectmen to receive substantial direct benefits from the public
sidewalk system.
7
II. Sidewalk Expense. The estimated net expense for sidewalks shall be raised
by a special tax assessed against all real property (but not personal property) in the sidewalk area.
[Amended, 1965.]
Section 17a. Parking Districts. The Selectmen shall have the authority to establish one or
more parking districts in the following manner:
I. The area to be included in any parking district shall be determined as set forth
in 1963, 374:12 [Section 12 supra ]. In addition, the Selectmen in their discretion may delete
properties in those cases where the present use does not justify inclusion within a parking district.
II. The Selectmen shall establish a separate inventory for the purpose of
assessment of taxes and establishment of parking space fees of the property located in each
parking district.
III. The Selectmen shall establish a separate inventory setting forth the off street
parking requirements for each property in the district by using as a measure the off street parking
requirements set forth in the Town Zoning Ordinance regardless of whether or not such
requirements apply under the Town Zoning Ordinance to any particular property. An individual
property's required off street parking spaces as reduced by the number of such parking spaces
actually provided as of the first day of April in each year, shall be the adjusted parking
requirement.
IV. Prior to the establishment of the first parking district, and thereafter on an
annual basis, the Selectmen shall prepare and present in advance a budget of anticipated
expenditures and income for the operation of the parking system in the Town. There shall be
included as anticipated income all revenue from the operation of the parking system in the Town.
At least 50 percent of the net expenses shall be paid by the parking district or districts on the
basis as set forth in paragraph V. The remainder of the net expenses shall be paid by taxes
assessed on all real estate in Town. The percentage of the amount of net expenses to be paid by
the parking district or districts shall be determined by the Selectmen at the time the first district is
established and may be changed by the Selectmen at the time of the establishment of other
districts or changed after a public hearing held in the same manner as when a parking district is
established as described in 1963, 374:12 [Section 12 supra.]
V. The amount of the net expenses to be paid by each district shall be on the basis
of an allocation between parking space fees and taxes assessed on real estate in the district. This
allocation shall be determined by the Selectmen at the time of the establishment of the parking
district and may be changed at the time additional districts are established or changed after a
public hearing held in the same manner as when a parking district is established as described in
1963, 374:12 [Section 12 supra.]
VI. The parking space fee for each property in the district shall be equal to the
proportionate share that each property's adjusted parking requirement bears to the total adjusted
parking requirements for all property in the district. All such parking space fees shall become a
8
lien upon the property so charged and such lien may be enforced by a suit on behalf of the Town
ordered by the Selectmen against the owner or owners of such property. The record in the office
of the Selectmen and the charges for the parking space fee set forth therein shall be sufficient
notice to maintain suit upon such lien against the subsequent purchasers or attaching creditors of
such real estate. In the event that the off street parking requirements set forth in the Town
Zoning Ordinance are amended, then the inventory of off street parking requirements for each
property in the property district shall be adjusted accordingly.
VII. In determining the formula for allocating the expenses between the
parking space fees and the amount to be raised by real estate taxes assessed on properties in the
district, the Selectmen shall take into consideration the following and in this order of priority:
a. A determination as to the need for parking spaces not met by off street
parking in any proposed parking district.
b. Present parking revenue obtained from the parking system in the proposed
parking district as well as additional revenue from additions to the parking system in the
proposed parking district.
c. The valuation of real estate subject to real estate taxes in the proposed
parking district. [Added, 1977 N.H. Laws Ch. 305:1.]

Ordinance at any time for conviction of any crime, including any violation of any provision
of this Ordinance by the driver of any taxicab, or whenever the Town shall find after a
hearing that the public good will be promoted by a revocation.

discharged to a private wastewater disposal facility.
K. At such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property serviced by a private
wastewater disposal system, the owner shall connect to the public sewer, as provided in
paragraph (I) above unless the private wastewater disposal system was approved after 1985
Ordinance # 14 Page 15 Amended November 18,2019
as provided in RSA 147:8. Any septic tanks, cesspools, and similar private wastewater
disposal facilities shall be removed or cleaned of sludge and filled with clean, mineral soils,
and their use shall be discontinued.
L. No privy vault, cesspool, sinkhole, septic tank or similar receptacle at any time shall be
connected with a public sewer.
M. All sanitary sewage and industrial wastewater from any building, subsequent to connection
of such building with a public sanitary sewer as required under Paragraph I of this Section,
shall be subject to limitations and restrictions as shall be established herein or otherwise
shall be established by the Town, from time to time.
N. No person(s) shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover,
deface, or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment that is part of the POTW.
0. No statement contained in the preceding paragraphs of this Section shall be construed to
interfere with any additional requirements that may be imposed by the Health Officer.
2.2 Building Sewers and Connections
A. No person(s) shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter, or
disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a building sewer,
excavation and connection permits from the Director of Public Works.
B. There shall be three (3) classes of building sewer permits: (a) for residential and
commercial service producing only sanitary sewage, (b) for service to establishments
producing industrial wastewater and (c) for combination of above two classes. For
residential and commercial services, the owner( s) or his agent shall make application on a
special form furnished by the Town at least thirty (30) days prior to said service
connection. For an establishment discharging industrial wastewater, the application shall
be made at least ninety (90) days prior to said service connection. The building sewer
permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information
(including pollution prevention studies) considered pertinent in the judgment of the
Director of Public Works. A permit and inspection fee (specific fees are available from the
Town as Appendix 3 - Sewer Rental Rates and Charges) shall be paid to the Town at the
time the application is filed.
C. The Town will, at its expense during construction of a new public sewer, construct a sewer
stub for a building located on a lot of record (as defined by Section 9.02 of the Town
Zoning Ordinance) as of June 1, 1979 if such building is located within 100 feet of the
existing public sewer, and therefore is required to connect to the public sewer as provided
in Section 2.1 (1), above. All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and
connection of the remainder of the building sewer, including connection to the structures
served, shall be the responsibility of the owner of the improved property to be connected.
If the building or proposed building is located beyond 100 feet of the existing public sewer
and the owner desires to connect to the public sewer then all costs associated with an
Ordinance # 14 Page 16 Amended November 18, 2019
extension of the public sewer to service the building will be the responsibility of the owner.
The owner(s) shall indemnifY the Town from any loss or damage that may directly or
indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. After the initial
construction of the building sewer, the owner shall thereafter be obligated to pay all costs
of expenses of operation, repair and maintenance and of reconstruction (if needed) of the
entire building sewer beginning at the public sewer and ending at the building.
D. If the owner of any building located within the Town and benefited, improved, served or
accommodated by any public sewer, or to which any public sewer is available, after 90
days notice from the Town, in accordance with Section 2.1(1), shall fail to connect such
building as required, s/he shall be in violation of this Ordinance and the Town may make
such connection and may collect from such owner the costs and expenses thereof by such
legal proceeding as may be permitted by law. The Town shall have full authority to enter
on owner's property to do whatever is necessary to properly drain the improved property
into the public sewer.
E. New developments which require sewer extensions shall be responsible for all cost related
to sewer extensions required to serve said development including necessary improvements
to the downstream collection system and the POTW. When sewer is extended to a
currently unsewered area the developer shall extend sewers to the furthest property comer
away from the existing sewer on a road of a lot fronting on a Town right-of-way where
there is either existing developed or potentially developable lot or lots.
F. A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building. Grouping
of more than one building on one building sewer shall not be permitted.
G. Existing building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are
found, on examination and test by the Director of Public Works, to meet all requirements of
this Ordinance. The minimum size for commercial services shall be 6" regardless of the
condition of the existing service. Commercial services shall only be reused if they are cast
iron, ductile iron or PVC and found to be in good shape, alignment and of proper size.
Other pipe types shall only be reused if they are slip-lined with an approved material,
provide they are found to be in other wise good shape, alignment and of proper size.
H. The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer, and the methods
to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing, and backfilling the trench,
shall all conform to the Town's Specifications for Sewer Construction (see Appendix 2 -
Standard Specifications for Sewer Line Construction), the requirements of the building and
plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the Town. No outside cleanouts
shall be allowed in any service. One 22112 deg elbow will be allowed, a second 22112 deg
elbow may be allowed with prior approval of the Director of Public Works.
In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures
set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) and the Water Environment Federation (WEF) Manual of Practice No. FD-5 shall
Ordinance # 14 Page 17 Amended November 18, 2019
apply. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by
the Director of Public Works before installation.
I. All services with a Food Preparation and Serving Facility shall provide a Grease removal
system sized pursuant to Appendix 5- Fats, Oil & Grease Control.
J. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public
sewer, sanitary sewage conveyed by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved
means and discharged to the building sewer at the owner's expense. Pumping systems shall
provide adequate storage for a minimum 24 hour power outage and a minimum of one
pump run per day.
K . All sewer services where the basement floor is below the sewer main shall have a check
valve installed in the service line to prevent backflow into the building.
L. No person(s) shall make connection of roof downspouts, interior or exterior foundation
drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building
sewer or building drain that in tum is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary
sewer.
M. No person shall obstruct the free flow of air through any drain or soil pipe.
N. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Director of Public Works when
the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. Such notice
shall be provided not less than 48 hours in advance of the time any connection is to be
made to any public sewer. The connection and testing shall be made under the supervision
of the Director of Public Works or his representative. No building sewer or repair thereto
shall be covered until it has been inspected and approved by the Town. If any part of a
building sewer is covered before being inspected and approved, it shall be uncovered for
inspection at the cost and expense of the owner of the building to be connected to a sewer.
This requirement shall also apply to repairs or alterations to building connections, drains or
pipes thereto.
0 . Suitable provisions shall be made at the industrial user's connection for sampling, which
responsibility shall rest with the holder of the sewer connection permit. Sewer manholes
are required at the connection of any commercial or industrial establishment and the Town
sewer.
P. The Director of Public Works shall maintain a record of all connections made to public
sewers and drains under this Ordinance and all repairs and alterations made to building
connections or drains connected to or discharging into public sewers and drains of the
Town or intended to so discharge. All persons concerned shall assist the Director of Public
Works in securing data needed for such records.
Q. All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades
and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other
Ordinance # 14 Page 18 Amended November 18,2019
public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the Town at the expense of the owner. No excavations within the traveled
portion of any road shall remain open overnight. All excavations within the traveled
portion of any pavement shall be patched with new asphalt, cold patch or steel plate as
approved by the Director of Public Works at the end of each day.
R. Under RSA 485 and 485-A, proposed new discharges from residential or commercial
sources in excess of 5000 gpd and which serve more than one building or which require a
manhole at the connection and for any proposed pumping station which serves more than
one building or has a capacity in excess of 50 gallons per minute require a NHDES Sewer
Connection Permit. Applications need not be submitted for domestic connections less than
5000 gpd provided that no new sewerage construction is proposed.
S. If the Owner of any building located within the Town shall fail or refuse, upon receipt of a
notice of the Town, in writing, to remedy any unsatisfactory condition with respect to a
building sewer, within 45 days of receipt of such notice (except that in the case of dire
emergency this time period may be reduced as necessary to protect the health and safety of
the residents of the Town), the Town may remedy any unsatisfactory condition with respect
to a building sewer and may collect from the Owner the costs and expenses thereof by such
legal proceedings as may be provided by law. The Town shall have full authority, as
allowed by law, to enter on the Owner's property to do whatever is necessary to remedy the
unsatisfactory condition.
T. Every building sewer shall be maintained in a sanitary and safe operating condition by the
owner.
U. When a building is demolished and not immediately replaced, the owner, having first
obtained a building demolition permit, shall adequately seal off his building sewer where it
connects to the public sewer.
V. Where the owner intends to excavate within or otherwise disturb public property, the owner
shall follow all directions of the Director of Public Works and shall promptly and safely
and at the owner's own expense, complete the action and restore the public property in a
manner satisfactory to the Town.
W. Garbage Grinding or shredding devices are prohibited by this Ordinance and shall not be
connected to any sanitary sewer.
2.3 Variances
A. The Director of Public Works, with the approval of the Town Manager, may allow
reasonable variances from the provisions of Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this Ordinance, which
will not result in a violation of State or federal law, provided:
1. The owner shall be responsible for any administration fee, to be determined by the
SELECTBOARD;
Ordinance #14 Page 19 Amended November 18, 2019
2. The variance allowed is the least variance reasonable;
3. The variance will not cause undue harm or inconvenience to the Town, the POTW, or
the Owner's neighbors;
4. The variance is justified by substantial reason; and
5. The variance is at the discretion of the Director of Public Works.
B. The Owner shall apply for the variance in writing to the Director of Public Works. The
application shall identify the name and address of the Owner, the property in question, the
specific variance sought by the Owner and a substantial reason justifying the variance. The
variance fee shall be paid with the application or the variance shall be deemed to have been
denied. The variance as issued shall identify any changes, limitations or restrictions on the
variance as applied for.
2.4 Prohibited Discharge Standards
A. General Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any
pollutant or wastewater that causes pass through or interference, or has an adverse effect on
the receiving stream. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether
or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other federal, State, or
local pretreatment standards or requirements.
B. Specific Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the
following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:

CFR 261.21;
2. Any waters or wastewaters having a pH less than 5.5 or greater than 11.5 or having
any other corrosive property that may be capable of causing damage or hazard to
structures, equipment, and/or personnel of the sewage works, or with acidity or
alkalinity in such quantities that the Town believes may cause, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference, pass-through or the Water
Reclamation Facility's influent pH to be less than 6.0 or greater than 9.0;
3. Solid or viscous substances including water or wastes containing fats, wax, grease, or
oils, whether emulsified or not, or containing substances that may solidify or become
viscous at temperatures between thirty-two (32) and one hundred fifty (150) degrees
Ordinance # 14 Page 20 Amended November 18, 20 19
Fahrenheit (0-65 degrees C), in amounts that will cause obstruction of the flow in the
POTW or result in interference with the proper operation of the POTW;
4. Any wastes, including oxygen-demanding released in a discharge at a flow rate
and/or pollutant concentration that, either singly or by interaction with other
pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW, constitute a hazard to humans or
animals, create a public nuisance, exceed any national categorical pretreatment
standard, cause process upset, loss of treatment ability or cause pass through;
5. Wastewater having a temperature greater than 150°F (65°C), or that will inhibit
biological activity or damage pipes or structures; In no case shall wastewater cause
the temperature of the waste stream entering the wastewater treatment facility to

10. Any medical/infectious waste, pharmaceutical waste, or radiological waste designated
by the municipality as having a reasonable potential for violating any pretreatment
standard or requirement;
11. Any wastewater that would prevent disposal of sludge in the manner used by the
POTW;
12. Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the Water
Reclamation Facility's effluent to fail a toxicity test.
C. Additional Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW
the following substances, pollutants or wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the
Director of Public Works in an IDP:
1. Wastewater that imparts color that may not be removed by the treatment process,
such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which
consequently may impart color to the treatment facility's effluent, thereby violating
the Town's NPDES permit;
Ordinance # 14 Page 21 Amended November 18,2019
2. Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater that, either singly
or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a
hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the public sewers for maintenance or repair;
3. Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except in compliance with
applicable State or federal regulations;
4. Storm water, surface water, groundwater, artesian well water, roof runoff, subsurface
drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized water, non-contact cooling

Lower Explosive Limit of the meter;
9. Any quantities of flow, concentrations, or both which constitute a "slug" as defined
herein;
10. Waters or wastes which, by interaction with other water or wastes in the treatment
works, release dangerous or noxious gases, form suspended solids which affect the
operation of the collection system, or create a condition deleterious to structures and
treatment processes; and
11. Any materials which exert or cause unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids
(such as, but not limited to, Fullers earth, lime, slurries, and lime residues) or of
dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate).
Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in
such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW.
2.5 Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards
A. The federal categorical pretreatment standards are found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter
N, Parts 405-471.
B. EPA shall be the control authority for industrial users subject to federal categorical
pretreatment standards. As the control authority, industrial users are responsible to the
EPA for compliance with categorical pretreatment standards and the requirements of 40
Ordinance # 14 Page 22 Amended November 18, 2019
CFR Part 403. Categorical industrial users shall provide the Town with copies of any
reports to, or correspondence with EPA relative to compliance with the categorical
pretreatment standards.
C. The industrial user is responsible to determine the applicability of categorical pretreatment
standards. The user may request that EPA provide written certification on whether the user
is subject to the requirements of a particular category.
2.6 Local Discharge Restrictions
A. All persons discharging industrial process wastes into public or private sewers connected to
the Town's POTW shall comply with applicable federal requirements and State standards
for pretreatment of wastes (as amended) in addition to the requirements of this Ordinance.
B. Local numerical discharge limitations established by the Town, and all State, and Federal
pretreatment standards shall apply, whichever is most stringent. Fume toxicity,
explosivity, and ignitability screening levels will be enforced for the protection of
personnel or sewer structures.
C. Pollutants of concern are those for which regulatory controls will be administered by the
Town of Hanover. These include pollutants that might reasonably be expected to be
discharged to the POTWin quantities that may pass through or interfere with the POTW,
contaminate the sludge, or adversely impact worker health or safety. The Town has
calculated allowable headworks loading limits for all metals for which there are
applicable restrictions placed on the POTW.
D. If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the POTW that
exceed the standards or restrictions established in Sections 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and Appendix 1 of
this Ordinance, which in the judgment of the Director of Public Works may have a
deleterious effect upon the POTW, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or that
otherwise create a hazard to worker safety or health, or constitute a public nuisance, the
Director of Public Works may:
1. Reject or prevent any discharge to the POTW after notice has been served to the
discharger. The discharger shall respond within 15 days with a corrective action
plan;
2. Require pretreatment prior to discharge to the POTW (see Section 3);
3. Require control (e.g., equalization) over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
4. Require payment to cover additional cost of handling and treating the wastes.
Ordinance # 14 Page 23 Amended November 18,2019
E. If the Director of Public Works allows the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design and installation of the systems and equipment shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Director of Public Works and the State (see Section 3).
F. Maximum Allowable Industrial Loadings. (Headworks Loading Limits) (Appendix 1.1)
1. For all industrial users connected to sewer lines that are tributary to the Town of
Hanover POTW, the Public Works Department will not issue permits, which in
combination with other industrial loads, exceed the values in Appendix 1.1.
2. All mass loading limitations for metals represent total metals, regardless of the
valance state, or the physical or chemical form of the metal. To administer these
allowable loadings through lOPs, the Public Works Department may impose
concentration-based limitations, mass limitations, or both. For industrial users, the
values written into IDPs for the above pollutants shall control the industrial waste
stream and may be adjusted to account for dilution with non-industrial wastewaters.
3. Unless specifically identified in an IDP, an industrial user is not allowed to
discharge the locally limited pollutants at concentrations greater than normal
sanitary wastewater (i.e., background concentrations). Authorization for discharge
may be granted subject to the Public Works Department's administrative
procedures for managing mass loading limitations.
4. Daily concentration (or mass loading) is the concentration (or mass) of a pollutant
discharged, determined from the analysis of a flow-composited sample (or other
sampling procedure approved by the Public Works Department) representative of
the discharge over the duration of a 24-hour day or industrial operating schedule
of less than 24 hours.
G. Screening Levels. (Appendix 1.2)
1. Screening levels are numerical values above which actions are initiated to
evaluate, prevent or reduce potential adverse impacts on the POTW, the
environment, and/or human health and safety. Screening levels are developed as
needed using the methodology of the Public Works Department. The pollutants
in Appendix 1.2 (list is not all inclusive) are representative of concentrations
above which pollutants shall not be discharged to the POTW without approval of
the Public Works Department.
2. If any of the screening levels are exceeded, repeat analysis may be required by the
Public Works Department to verify compliance or noncompliance with that
screening level. If noncompliance is indicated, then the industrial user may be
required, at the discretion of the Public Works Department, to conduct an
appropriate engineering evaluation at the industrial user's expense to determine
the potential impact of the discharge of this pollutant to the POTW or
alternatively, to develop a Pollution Prevention Plan or Best Management
Practices Plan specifically addressing the pollutant that exceeds the screening
Ordinance # 14 Page 24 Amended November 18, 2019
level. This study or plan shall be approved by and conducted under the
supervision of the Public Works Department and in accordance with section 3.4
of this Ordinance. Should the evaluation indicate the impact to be unsatisfactory,
the industrial user shall reduce the pollutant concentration to a satisfactory level.
3. If an industrial user proposes to discharge at concentrations greater than the
concentration-based screening level maintained by the Public Works Department,
then the industrial user may be required to conduct the evaluations described in
the previous paragraph. Should the evaluations support an alternate site-specific
limitation, then the screening level may, at the discretion of the Public Works
Department, be adjusted as a special agreement for the industrial user and
administered as a permit limitation for the specific discharge.
4. For industrial discharge applications, conservative pollutant screening levels shall
apply at the end of the process train prior to dilution with non-industrial wastewater.
Conservative pollutant screening levels contained in IDPs may be adjusted to
account for combined sanitary and industrial wastewater present at the point of
sampling.
H. Best Management Practices.
1. The Director of Public Works may develop Best Management Practices (BMPs ),
by ordinance or in IDPs, or require that an industrial user develop BMPs, to
implement Local Limits and the requirements of this Ordinance.
2. Such BMPS shall be considered local limits and Pretreatment Standards for the
purposes of this Ordinance.
I. Special Agreements. No statement contained in this Section except for paragraphs 2.4(A),
2.4(B), and 2.5 shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement
between the Town and any industrial user whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength
or character may be accepted by the Town for treatment provided that said agreements do
not contravene any requirements of existing federal or State laws, and/or regulations
promulgated there under, are compatible with any user charge system in effect, and do not
waive applicable federal categorical pretreatment standards. Special agreement requests
may require submittal of a BMP Plan that specifically addresses the discharge for which a
special agreement is requested.
2.7 Town's Right of Revision
The discharge standards and requirements set forth in Sections 2.4 (PROHIBITED DISCHARGE
STANDARDS), 2.5 (FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRE-TREATMENT STANDARDS) and 2.6
(LOCAL DISCHARGE RESTRICTIONS), are established for the purpose of preventing
discharges to the POTW that would harm either the public sewers, wastewater treatment process,
Ordinance # 14 Page 25 Amended November 18,2019
or equipment; would have an adverse effect on the receiving stream; or would otherwise endanger
lives, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance.
To meet these objectives, the Director of Public Works may, from time to time, review and set
more stringent standards or requirements than those established in Sections 2.4 (PROHIBITED
DISCHARGE STANDARDS), 2.5 (FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRE-TREATMENT
STANDARDS) and 2.6 (LOCAL DISCHARGE RESTRICTIONS) if, in his opinion, such more
stringent standards or requirements are necessary to meet the above objectives. At a minimum,
this review will be performed at least once every five years. In forming his opinion, the Director of
Public Works may give consideration to such factors as the quantity of waste in relation to flows
and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment
process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment facility, degree of treatability at the
wastewater treatment facility, pollution prevention activities, and other pertinent factors. The
limitations or restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste or wastewaters discharged to the
sanitary sewer shall not be exceeded without the approval of the Director of Public Works.
The Director of Public Works shall allow affected industrial users reasonable time to comply with
any changes to the local limits. The conditions and schedule for compliance shall accompany the
written notification of any amended screening levels or limitations of this Ordinance.
2.8 Dilution
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as
a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge
limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Director of Public Works may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate.
2.9 Mass-Based Limitations
Users implementing process changes may request that compliance be determined based on mass
limitations in lieu of concentration limitations. Such mass-based limitations will be calculated
from the permitted concentration-based limitations and flows, and shall be equivalent to or less
than the mass discharge in effect at the time of the request. The intent of a mass-based limit is to
encourage and allow pollution prevention and/or water conservation measures that might cause a
facility to increase pollutant concentrations in their discharge even though the total mass of the
pollutant discharged does not increase, and may in fact decrease. Decisions on granting requests
for mass-based compliance limitations will be based on user-specific information and current
operating conditions of the POTW, and will be at the discretion of the Director of Public Works.
Implementation of mass-based limitations may not contravene any requirements of federal or State
laws and/or regulations implemented there under, and may not waive applicable federal categorical
pretreatment standards.
Ordinance #14 Page 26 Amended November 18,2019
SECTION 3 -PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER
3.1 Pretreatment Facilities
Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this Ordinance and shall
achieve compliance with all pretreatment standards, screening levels, and the prohibitions set out
in Sections 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6 of this Ordinance within the time limitations specified by EPA, the
State, or the Director of Public Works, whichever is more stringent. All facilities required to
achieve and maintain compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense.
When required, facilities shall be operated by an operator licensed or certified by the State of New
Hampshire. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to
the Director of Public Works for review, and shall be acceptable to the Director of Public Works
and the NHDES before such facilities are constructed. Such facilities shall not be connected until
said approval is obtained in writing. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no
way relieve the user of the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a
discharge acceptable to the Town under the provisions of this Ordinance. Plans and specifications
for a proposed pretreatment facility shall be the result of the design of a professional engineer.
3.2 Additional Pretreatment Measures
A. Whenever deemed necessary, the Director of Public Works may require users to restrict
their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged
only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sanitary
sewage from industrial wastewaters, and such other conditions as may be necessary to
protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this
Ordinance.
B. The Director of Public Works may require any person discharging into the POTW to install
and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control
facility to ensure equalization of flow. An IDP may be issued solely for flow equalization.
C. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided at the owner's expense when, in the
opinion of the Director of Public Works they are necessary for wastewater discharges to
meet the limitations of this Ordinance. Fat, Oil & Grease interceptors shall be required for
all establishments listed in Appendix 5 of this Ordinance. All interception units shall be of
a type and capacity approved by the Director of Public Works and shall be so located as to
be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection by the owner and the Town. Maintenance
of these interceptors requires that the owner be responsible for the proper removal and
disposal by appropriate means of the captured materials and shall maintain records of the
dates and means of disposal, which shall be subject to periodic review by the Director of
Public Works. Reports shall be submitted at the discretion of the Director of Public Works
indicating all maintenance and cleaning activities.
D. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances shall construct containment
facilities which will prevent a discharge to the POTW. Users may be required to install and
Ordinance # 14 Page 27 Amended November 18, 2019
maintain a combustible gas detection meter at the discretion of the Director of Public
Works.

implement, at their own expense, a BMP Plan (also referenced as a pollution prevention plan). The
Director of Public Works may require users to submit as part of the BMP Plan information that
demonstrates adherence to the following elements:
A. Management Support. For changes to be effective, the visible support of top management
is required. Management's support should be explicitly stated and include designation of a
pollution prevention coordinator, goals, and time frames for reductions in volume and
toxicity of waste streams, and procedures for employee training and involvement.
B. Process Characterization. A detailed process waste diagram shall be developed that
identifies and characterizes the input of raw materials, the outflow of products, and the
generation of wastes.
C. Waste Assessment. Estimates shall be developed for the amount of wastes generated by
each process. This may include establishing and maintaining waste accounting systems to
track sources, the rates and dates of generation, and the presence of hazardous constituents.
D. Analysis of Waste Management Economics. Waste management economic returns shall be
determined based on the consideration of:
1. Reduced raw material purchases;
2. A voidance of waste treatment, monitoring and disposal costs;
3. Reductions in operations and maintenance expenses;
4. Elimination of permitting fees and compliance costs; and
5. Reduced liabilities for employee/public exposure to hazardous chemicals and cleanup
of waste disposal sites.
Ordinance # 14 Page29 Amended November 18,2019
E. Development ofBMP Alternatives. Current and past pollution prevention activities should
be assessed, including estimates of the reduction in the amount and toxicity of waste
achieved by the identified actions. Opportunities for pollution prevention must then be
assessed for identified processes where raw materials become or generate wastes.
Technical information on pollution prevention should be solicited and exchanged, both
from inside the organization and out.
F. Evaluation and Implementation. Technically and economically feasible pollution
prevention opportunities shall be identified and an implementation timetable with interim
and final milestones shall be developed. The recommendations that are implemented shall
be periodically reviewed for effectiveness.
G. Recordkeeping. Documentation demonstrating implementation or compliance with
BMPs shall be created, retained, and made available as required.
The review and approval of such BMP Plans by the Town shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibilities of modifying their facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the
Town in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.

Ordinance # 14 Page 41 Amended November 18,2019
6.9 Sample Collection
A. Except as indicated in paragraph (B) and (C) below, the user must collect wastewater
samples using flow-proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flowproportional
sampling is infeasible, the Director of Public Works may authorize the use of
time-proportional sampling or a minimum of four ( 4) grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
In addition, grab samples may be required to demonstrate compliance with instantaneous
maximum allowable discharge limitations (e.g., screening levels established to protect
worker health and safety). A single grab sample may also be used in place of a composite
sample with approval of the Director of Public Works when:
• The effluent is not discharged on a continuous basis (i.e., batch discharges of short
duration), and only when the batch exhibits homogeneous characteristics (i.e.,
completely mixed) and the pollutant can be safely assumed to be uniformly dispersed;
• Sampling a facility where a statistical relationship can be established between previous
grab samples and composite data; and
• The waste conditions are relatively constant (i.e., are completely mixed and
homogeneous) over the period of the discharge.
B. Samples for temperature, pH, cyanide, oil & grease, phenols, sulfides, volatile organic
compounds and all other pollutants as specified by 40 CFR Part 136 must be obtained
using grab collection techniques.
C. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may
be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil
and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
6.10 Timing
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports that
are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service,
the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
6.11 Recordkeeping
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Ordinance shall retain, and make available for
inspection and copying by authorized local, state or federal officials, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities, including documentation associated with Best
Management Practices, required by this Ordinance or IDP and any additional records of

Town, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Director
ofPublic Works.
SECTION 7- POWERS AND AUTHORITIES OF INSPECTORS
7.1 Compliance Monitoring
The Director of Public Works shall investigate instances of noncompliance with the industrial
pretreatment standards and requirements. The Director of Public Works shall, as necessary,
sample and analyze the wastewater discharges of contributing users and conduct surveillance and
inspection activities to identify, independently of information supplied by such users, occasional
and continuing noncompliance with industrial pretreatment standards. Each industrial user will be
billed directly for costs incurred for sampling and analysis of its wastewater.
7.2 Right of Entry: Inspection and Sampling
All industrial users discharging to the Town's POTW shall allow unrestricted access by Town,
State and EPA personnel for the purpose of determining whether the user is complying with all
requirements of this Ordinance, and any IDP or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the
Director of Public Works and other duly authorized employees of the Town bearing proper
credentials and identification ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional
duties.
A. Where a user has security measures in force that require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security
guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Director of Public Works or
other duly authorized employee(s) will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes
of performing specific responsibilities.
B. The Director of Public Works or other duly authorized employee( s) shall have the right to
set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
C. The Director of Public Works or other duly authorized employee(s) may require the user to
install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated at least annually to ensure their accuracy.
Ordinance # 14 Page 43 Amended November 18,2019
D. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal
request of the Director of Public Works or other duly authorized employee(s) and shall not
be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
E. Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director of Public Works or other duly authorized
employee(s) access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this Ordinance.
F. The Director of Public Works or other duly authorized employee(s) is authorized to obtain
information concerning industrial processes that have a bearing on the kind or source of
discharge to the public sewer. Such information may be treated as confidential if the
industrial user satisfies the requirements of Section 8.1 of this Ordinance. However,
information regarding wastewater discharged by the user (flow, sources, constituents,
concentrations, and characteristics) shall be available to the public without restriction.
G. The Director of Public Works or other duly authorized employee(s) of the Town bearing
proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all private properties
through which the Town holds a duly negotiated easement for the purposes of, but not
limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair, and maintenance of any
portion of the POTW lying within said easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any,
on said easement, shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated
easement pertaining to the private property involved.
7.3 Administrative Inspection Warrants
If the Director of Public Works or other duly authorized employee has been refused access to a
property where (a) probable cause exists to believe that a violation of this Ordinance exists; or (b)
there is a need to conduct a routine inspection or to perform testing or sampling designed to verify
compliance with this Ordinance or with any permit or order issued hereunder, the Director or
Director's designee may seek an administrative inspection warrant pursuant to the provisions of
RSA Chapter 595-B.
SECTION 8 - CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION/PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
8.1 Confidential Information
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, lOP Applications, lOPs, monitoring
programs, and from the Director of Public Works inspection and sampling activities, shall be
available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, in writing, and is
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works, that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets under applicable State and Federal law. INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO
RSA 91-A:5 (EXEMPTIONS UNDER THE RIGHT TO KNOW LAW). Any such request must
be asserted, in writing, at the time of submittal of the information or data. When requested and
demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
Ordinance #14 Page 44 Amended November 18,2019
portions of a report identified by the user which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately
upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person providing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be
recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.
8.2 Public Participation
The Town shall comply with the public participation requirements of 40 CFR Part 25 in the
administration of industrial pretreatment standards and requirements.
SECTION 9- PUBLICATION OF POLLUTION PREVENTION ACHIEVEMENTS
The Director of Public Works may publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper, circulated in
the Municipality where the POTW is located, a list of users whom during the previous twelve (12)
months, demonstrated a commitment to reducing the volume and toxicity of waste discharges. All
pollution prevention efforts, not just those that affect wastewater discharges, are subject to
recognition. The following criteria may be used to identify published users:
A. Innovative ideas the facility has used to implement process changes that eliminate or
reduce the volume or toxicity of waste generated;
B. The percentage of the facility's process water reused within the system or process;
C. The percentage of the facility's potential waste reused within the system or process;
D. Implementation of employee pollution prevention training and communication programs;
E. Voluntary performance of pollution prevention audits;
F. Spill control procedures/devices (e.g., secondary containment) the facility initiates to
prevent accidental chemical spills from entering the POTW; and
G. The environmental and/or economic benefits or successes derived from implementing
pollution prevention methods.
The intent of the publication is to notify local consumers of the environmental responsiveness of
local businesses, and to encourage industrial users to identify and implement opportunities for
preventing pollution. As part of this publication, the Town may provide an evaluation of the
impact of these changes to the POTW, and summarize the current status of pollutant loadings to
the POTW and goals established by the POTW for pollution prevention efforts.
Ordinance # 14 Page 45 Amended November 18,2019
SECTION 10- ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
10.1 Notification ofViolation
When the Director of Public Works determines that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this Ordinance, an IDP or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Director of Public Works may serve upon that user a Notice of Violation.
Within the time period specified in the violation notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan
for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be
submitted by the user to the Director of Public Works. Submittal of this plan in no way relieves
the user of liability for any violations occurring before or subsequent to receipt of the Notice of
Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Director of Public Works to take
any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without initially issuing
a Notice of Violation.
10.2 Compliance Schedule Development
The Director of Public Works may require any user that has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this Ordinance, an IDP or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, to develop a compliance schedule. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section
shall comply with the following conditions:
A. The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement
and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional
pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such
events include, but are not limited to, retaining an engineer, completing preliminary and
final design plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing
construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation);
B. No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
C. The user shall submit a progress report to the Director of Public Works no later than
fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance
including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the
reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the action being taken by the user to return to the
established schedule; and
D. In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the
Director of Public Works.
10.3 Best Management Practices Plan Development
The Director of Public Works may require any user that has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this Ordinance, an IDP, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, to develop a Best Management Practices Plan (also referenced as a pollution
prevention plan) in accordance with Section 3.4 of this Ordinance. The plan must specifically
Ordinance # 14 Page 46 Amended November 18,2019
address violation(s) for which this action was undertaken. The plan shall be developed using good
engineering judgment and shall be submitted to the Director of Public Works no later than sixty
(60) days after the user was notified of this requirement.
10.4 Show Cause Orders
The Director of Public Works may order a user that has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this Ordinance, an IDP or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, to appear before the SELECTBOARD and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request
that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of
the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least ten (1 0) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
executing any other action against the user.
10.5 Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit Termination
Any industrial user, who violates the following conditions of this Ordinance or an IDP or order, or
any applicable State or federal law, is subject to permit termination:
A. Failure to notify the Director of Public Works of significant changes to the wastewater
prior to the changed discharge;
B. Failure to provide prior notification to the Director of Public Works of changed conditions
pursuant to Section 6.2 of this Ordinance;
C. Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the IDP application;
D. Falsifying self-monitoring reports;
E. Tampering with monitoring equipment;
F. Refusing to allow the Director of Public Works timely access to the facility premises and
records;
G. Failure to meet effluent limitations;

L. Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business ownership of a permitted
facility;
M. Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of the IDP or this
Ordinance; or
N. IDPs shall be voided upon cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership (except
for as allowed in section 5.6). All IDPs issued to a particular user are void upon the
issuance of a new IDP to that user.
10.6 Termination ofDischarge
Any user who violates a Section 10.5 criterion or fails to cease and desist from any discharge of
wastewater upon termination of their IDP for that discharge, is subject to discharge termination.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an
opportunity to show cause under Section 10.4 of this Ordinance why the proposed action should
not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Director of Public Works shall not be a bar to, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
10.7 Emergency Suspensions
The Director of Public Works may immediately suspend a user's wastewater discharge, subsequent
to informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to terminate an actual or
threatened discharge that reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of POTW personnel or the public. The Director of Public
Works may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond,
that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or that presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
A. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge permit shall immediately terminate or
eliminate its wastewater discharge. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director of Public Works may implement such
steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any
individuals. The Director of Public Works may allow the user to recommence its discharge
when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works that the
period of endangerment has passed, or corrective actions have been taken, unless the
termination proceedings in Sections 10.5 or 10.6 of this Ordinance are initiated against the
user.
B. A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the
harmful contribution and the measures implemented to prevent any future occurrence, to
the Director of Public Works prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing
under Section 10.4 ofthis Ordinance.
Ordinance # 14 Page 48 Amended November 18, 2019
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requmng a hearing prior to any emergency
suspension under this Section.
10.8 Recovery of Expenses
Any person or industrial user violating any of the provisions of this Ordinance shall become liable
to the Town for any expense, loss, or damage occasioned the Town by reason of such violation. If
the Director of Public Works or SELECTBOARD implemented the disconnection of a building
sewer from a public sewer, the Town may collect the expenses associated with completing the
disconnection from any person or user responsible for, or willfully concerned in, or who profited
by such violation. The Town may thereafter refuse to permit the restoration of the former
connection or of any new connection to the property concerned in the violation until the claim of
the Town for the cost of completing such disconnection shall have been paid in full plus interest
and the reasonable cost of any legal expenses incurred by the Town in connection therewith.
10.9 Harm to Town Property
No person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper
with any structure, appurtenance or equipment that is part of the POTW. Any person violating this
provision shall be guilty of criminal mischief and subject to immediate arrest and/or fines pursuant
to the local Ordinances and State and federal statutes. Ref. RSA 634:2.
10.10 Injunctive Relief
When the Director of Public Works determines that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this Ordinance, an IDP, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Director of Public Works may petition the Lebanon District Court or Grafton
County Superior Court through the Town's Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the IDP, order,
or other requirement imposed by this Ordinance on activities of the user. The Director of Public
Works may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including
a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, implementing any other action against a user.
10.11 Civil Penalties
The Town may pursue any other or any combination of remedies for enforcement of this
ordinance available to it under applicable law. Each day in which any such violation shall
continue shall be deemed a separate offense.
A. Any person or user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
Ordinance, an IDP, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement shall be liable to the Town for a maximum civil penalty of $10,000 per
violation, as authorized by RSA 149-1:6, per day, plus actual damages incurred by the
POTW. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
Ordinance #14 Page 49 Amended November 18,2019
B. The Town may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses
associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and
the cost of any actual damages incurred by the Town. The Town shall petition the Court
to impose, assess, and recover such sums.
C. In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall consider all relevant
circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation,
the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the
user's violation, corrective actions implemented by the user, the compliance history of the
user, and any other factor as justice requires.
D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
implementing any other action against a user.
E. The Town shall give notice of the alleged violation to the NHDES within 10 days of
commencement of any action under this section. (Ref. RSA 149-1:6)
10.12 Criminal Penalties
Any person who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this Ordinance, an IDP, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be subject to
criminal prosecution. The Director of Public Works shall cooperate with all law enforcement
officials having jurisdiction over such criminal conduct in the event that a prosecution is
undertaken. Every separate provision violated shall constitute a separate violation. Every day
that a violation occurs shall be deemed a separate violation. Additionally, any violation may be
referred to the state for criminal prosecution under its powers. (Ref. RSA 485-A:22 and RSA
485-A:S)
10.13 Nonexclusive Remedies
The remedies provided for in this Ordinance are not exclusive. The Town may take any, all, or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations
will generally be in order of potential impact as determined by the Director of Public Works.
However, the Town may pursue other action against any user without limitation, including ex parte
temporary judicial relief to prevent a violation of this Ordinance. Further, the Town is empowered
to pursue more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
SECTION 11- AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
11.1 Upset
A. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is
unintentional and temporary noncompliance with pretreatment standards due to factors
beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the
Ordinance # 14 Page 50 Amended November 18, 2019
extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance
with pretreatment standards ifthe requirements of paragraph (C), below, are met.
C. A user who intends to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through
properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
1. An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
2. At the time of the upset, the facility was being operated in a prudent and workmanlike
manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
3. The user has submitted the following information to the Director of Public Works
within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is
provided orally, a written submittal must be provided within five (5) days):
(a) A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;
(b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not
corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
(c) Action being implemented and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user causing an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E. Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in
an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards.
F. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain
compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment
facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of
power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
11.2 Prohibited Discharge Standards
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 2.4(A) of this Ordinance or the specific
prohibitions in Section 2.4(B) of this Ordinance if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason
to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would
cause pass through or interference and that either:
Ordinance # 14 Page 51 Amended November 18, 2019
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each
limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents
from the user's prior discharge when the Town was regularly in compliance with its
NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge
use or disposal requirements.
11.3 Bypass
A. For the purposes of this section:
1. "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
2. "Severe Property Damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage
to the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and
permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the
absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused
by delays in production.
B. A user may allow any bypass to occur that does not cause pretreatment standards or
requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure
efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (C) and
(D) of this section.
C. The user shall provide the following notifications for bypass events:
1. If a user is aware in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to
the Director of Public Works, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if
possible.
2. A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of Public Works and the Water
Reclamation Facility Superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds
applicable pretreatment standards immediately. A written submittal shall also be
provided within five (5) days ofthe time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submittal shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration
of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps implemented or
planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
D. Bypass is prohibited, and the Director of Public Works may initiate enforcement action
against a user for a bypass, unless:
1. Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property
damage;
Ordinance # 14 Page 52 Amended November 18,2019
2. There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary
treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal
periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up
equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering
judgment to prevent a bypass that occurred during normal periods of equipment
downtime or preventive maintenance; and
3. The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (C) of this section.
E. The Director of Public Works may approve an anticipated bypass, subsequent to
considering its adverse effects, if the Director of Public Works determines that it will
satisfy the three conditions listed in paragraph (D) of this section.

The manhole will be filled with water to the top of the cone section. If the
excavation has not been backfilled and there is no water visibly moving down the
outer surface of the manhole, it will be considered satisfactorily water-tight. If the
excavation has been backfilled, the contractor has the option to allow a period of
time for absorption. At the end of this period, the manhole will be refilled, if
necessary and the measuring time of at least eight (8) hours begun. At the end of
the 8-hour period, the drop of the water level in the manhole will be measured and
compared to the allowable drop or water loss represented by Table 1.

SEWER RENTAL RATES AND CHARGES
3.1 Sewer Rates
A. The assessment and collection of the expense of constructing and maintaining the
POTW shall be governed by the provisions of RSA 149-1 and the Charter of the
Town of Hanover 1963 Laws Ch. 374 as amended, and any other applicable general
laws. In conformance with Section 15 of the Town Charter, the entire expense of
construction and maintenance of the sewage disposal system shall be met by a user
charge (hereinafter called sewer rental rate) as herein provided.
B. The revenues collected, as a result of the sewer rental rates levied, shall be deposited
in a separate non-lapsing fund known as the Sewer Fund.
C. Fiscal year-end balances in the sewer fund shall be used for no other purposes than
those designated. Monies that have been transferred from other sources to meet
temporary shortages in the operation, maintenance and replacement fund shall be
returned to their respective accounts upon appropriate adjustment of the user charge
rates for operation, maintenance and replacement. The sewer rental rate(s) shall be
adjusted such that the transferred monies will be returned to their respective accounts
within twelve (12) months of the end of the fiscal year in which the monies were
borrowed.
D. Each user shall pay for the services provided by the Town based on its use of the
wastewater treatment facility as determined by water meter readings (or other
appropriate methods) as indicated in the latest Rates and Fee Schedule adopted by
the Board of Selectmen.
E. Sewer rates shall be determined on a periodic basis as follows:
1. Base charge covering fixed costs, determined by meter size comparing average
flows for each meter vs. total consumption.
2. A Flow charges based on the annual cost of the system operation related to flow
and not strength or fixed cost related.
3. A Strength charge based on the cost of treating BOD & TSS. The strength
charge shall be based upon three Categories of strength levels as follows:
Ordinance #14
a. Category A- Low strength less than 250 mg/1 of BOD & or TSS.
b. Category B -Medium strength greater than or equal to 250 mg/1 and less
than 400 mg/1 of BOD & orTSS.
Page 1 of6
Amended September 13, 2010
c. Category C - High strength greater than or equal to 400 mg/1 of BOD &
or TSS. This category shall include All Food Preparation Establishments
without an Approved Automatic Grease Removal System.
Each account strength classification shall be determined by the highest
classification of any use within a facility as shown in the Equivalent User Table.
F. Users for whom no water meter readings are available, the sewer rental rate shall be
based on a flat use based on the average equivalent user provided in the Rates and
Fees Schedule and a surcharge of25%. No new unmetered services shall be allowed.
G. For users, sewer consumptive rates will be based on the quantity of wastewater
discharged based on the water meter readings for water consumed during a billing
period.
H. In the event that a water meter is either not registering or incorrectly registering,
the Town will estimate consumption based upon an average of previous readings.
When no previous readings exist, the consumption will be based upon one half of
the Equivalent user flow as indicated in the Equivalent User Flow in Section 3.5.
There shall be no more than two (2) consecutive estimated bills.
I. If a large user(> 5,000 gpd) can demonstrate to the Director of Public Works that a
substantial quantity (greater than 50%) of metered water is not discharged into the
wastewater collection system, the user may submit a request to have a wastewater
meter installed as a basis of establishing wastewater discharge. Wastewater meter( s)
when approved by the Town shall be installed, maintained, inspected and tested by
a qualified third party at the user's expense. An alternate method may be considered
when the entire flow of a branch of the water service lines within a facility does not
enter the sewer system. In this case a separate meter may be installed, maintained,
inspected and tested annually by a qualified third party at the user's expense on the
water service line that the entire respective flow does not enter the sewer system. A
deduction of flow which is metered shall be applied to the user's consumption total.
An additional meter reading and account administration charge shall apply for each
additional meter.
J. Any user that discharges any pollutants (as defined in this Ordinance), which cause
an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge from the Town's
wastewater treatment facility, or any user that discharges any substance, which
singly or by interaction with other substances causes identifiable increases in the
cost of operation, maintenance or replacement of the wastewater treatment facility,
shall be required to cease or control the discharge or required to pay for such
increased costs. The charge to each such user shall be as determined by the by the
Director of Public Works and approved by the Board of Selectmen.
Page 2 of6
Ordinance # 14 Amended September 13, 2010
K. The sewer rental rate established in this Section shall apply to all users of the Town's
wastewater treatment facility.
L. All users contributing wastewater whose waste strength is greater than normal
sanitary sewage shall prepare and file with the Town Self Monitoring Reports report
that shall include pertinent data relating to the wastewater characteristics, including
the methods of sampling and measurement to obtain these data, and these data shall
be used to calculate the sewer rental rate for that user. The Town shall have the right
to gain access to the waste stream and take its own samples. Should the Town do so
and should the results be substantially different from the data submitted by the user,
the sewer rental rate for that user shall be revised for thenext billing cycle/period.
M. All users shall be billed a minimum of four times per year. Payments are due within
30 days following the billing day. Any payment not made by 30 days following the
billing day in which it is due shall be considered delinquent and subject to a late
payment penalty of one ( 1) percent for each thirty days or portion thereof of
delinquency, except that, when bills for payment under this section are mailed on or
after the billing date, interest shall not be charged until 30 days after the last bill is
mailed.
N. When any bill (including interest and penalty) remains unpaid for one (1) year after
the date due, such bill shall be collected in conformance with RSA 149-I, or revisions
thereto.
0 . Any user who believes his sewer rental rate is unjust and inequitable may make
written application to the Town requesting a review of his sewer rental rate. Said
written request shall, where necessary, show the actual or estimated average flow
and/or strength of his wastewater in comparison with the values upon which the
sewer rental rate is based, including how the measurements or estimates were
determined. Any user within a category may provide testing, approved by the
Director of Public Works, to justify changing to a different category. Testing
methods, requirements, frequency and type shall be the sole discretion of the
DirectorofPublic Works.
P. Review of the request shall be made by the Board of Selectmen and if substantiated,
the sewer rental rates for that user shall be recomputed based on the revised flow and
the new sewer rental rates shall be applicable to the next billing cycle/period.
Q. The Board of Selectmen will review the sewer rental rates at least annually and
revise the rates as necessary to ensure that adequate revenues are generated to pay
the costs of operation and maintenance including replacement and that the system
continues to provide for the proportional distribution of operation and maintenance
including replacement costs among users and user classes.
R. The Town will notify users at a noticed public hearing of the sewer rental rate being
Page 3 of6
Ordinance # 14 Amended September 13, 2010
charged for operations and maintenance, including replacement costs related to the
wastewater treatment facility.
S. The sewer rental rates as established by the Town latest Rates and Fee Schedule
adopted by the Board of Selectmen shall prevail. Any previous contracts, agreements,
or arrangements as to rates, methods for collection, or any other element effecting
rates and charges shall be null and void.
T. The Town shall revise or amend sewer rental rates and charges, as deemed necessary
for the operation and maintenance of the POTW.

that the facility has a reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW' s
operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement.
5. 7 Variance/ Appeal
Under certain circumstances the interceptor type, size and location may require special
exceptions to this Ordinance. If an exception to this Ordinance is requested, the user shall
demonstrate that the size, type and location will not cause the facility to exceed the local
discharge restrictions contained in Appendix 1.
The Director of Public Works reserves the right to make determinations of grease
interceptor adequacy and need, based on review of all relevant information (including
analytical results) regarding grease interceptor performance, facility site and building
plan review, and to require repairs to, or modification or replacement of such removal
systems.
5.8 Specific Prohibitions
(1) Installation of food grinders, disposers, or pulpers in the plumbing system of new
constructions or when remodeling food service facilities shall be prohibited.

(6) No person shall dispose, deposit, spill, pour, inject, seep, dump, leak or place by
any means, including any direct or indirect entry, any FOG, or solid or liquid
matter into the storm sewer system, or in a location where it can reasonably be
anticipated to flow into or enter the storm sewer system.
5.9 Enforcement
When the Director of Public Works determines that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this Ordinance, an IDP or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard the Town of Hanover will take appropriate enforcement actions.
These actions may include notice of violations, recovery of expenses, fines, civil
penalties or a discontinuance of sewer service as specified in Section 10 of the Town of
Hanover SUO.
If other spills or illicit discharges occur from a Food Service Establishment resulting in
other violations the appropriate Town, State, or Federal agency will be notified.
6.0 Best Management Practices
FOG can be managed effectively in Food Service Establishments to mm1m1ze its
discharge to the sewer system and decrease the required maintenance of Grease
Interceptors and Automatic Grease Removal Devices. By preventing the introduction of
grease into the wastewater treatment system you reduce the burden on the Grease
Interceptors and Automatic Grease Removal Device and thus reduce maintenance time,
costs and disposal fees. Best Management Practices are techniques used throughout the
industry and have proven effective when implemented properly and consistently.
BMP's may be required for Food Service Establishments when in the opinion of the
Director of Public Works they are required to meet the local discharge restrictions
contained in Appendix 1 of this ordinance. A list of BMP's will be attached to specific
Food Service Establishment Wastewater Discharge Permits or are available through
contacting the Public Works Department.
6.1 Dumpsters and Grease Storage Areas
Grease and other waste storage containers must be leak-proof and stored on an
impervious surface in a manner to prevent spills from reaching storm drains or
stormwater runoff.
1) Keep storage containers closed except when adding waste.
Page 9 of 11
Ordinance # 14 Amended November 18,2019
2) When transferring cooking oil/grease to outside containers from kitchens, cover
the container with a tight lid during transport and clean up any spills immediately.
3) Prepare a spill kit and locate it near the container. It should be labeled "Spill Kit"
4) Use drip pans or absorbent materials whenever grease containers are emptied by
vacuum trucks or other means. Grease cannot be left on the ground. Clean up
spills immediately. Collected grease must be properly disposed of as a solid
waste.
5) Clean stains and grease spills using dry methods such as kitty litter or speedy dry.
Dispose of spent sorbent materials to a solid waste container
6) Check storage containers as needed for leaks and to ensure that lids are on tightly.
Replace containers that are leaking, corroded, or otherwise deteriorating.
7) Sweep and clean the storage area as needed to prevent buildup of grease. Do not
hose down the area to a storm drain.
8) Water cleanup methods are only allowed without detergents and only after the
spill has been removed with dry cleanup methods first. If wash water is
contaminated it may be discharged to the sanitary sewer with prior approval or
contained and trucked off site to an approved disposal location.
6.2 Commercial Hood Cleaning
All sanitary sewer discharges associated with cleaning and pressure washing grease hoods
and ductwork shall be discharged in accordance with the Town of Hanover Sewer Use
Ordinance #14. Wastewater containing grease shall be discharged to a fixture which is
conveyed to a grease trap or interceptor. The wastewater discharged shall not contain
emulsification chemicals in amounts that will cause grease to bypass the grease trap or
interceptor.
The following is a partial list of prohibited discharges from the Town of Hanover Sewer
Use Ordinance #14 and NH DES Env-Wq 305. No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:
1) Any waters or wastewaters having a pH less than 5. 5 or greater than 11 .5
2) Solid or viscous substances including water or wastes containing fats, wax, grease,
or oils, whether emulsified or not, or containing substances that may solidify or
become viscous at temperatures between thirty-two (32) and one hundred fifty
(150) degrees Fahrenheit (0-65 degrees C), in amounts that will cause obstruction
of the flow in the POTW or result in interference with the proper operation of the
POTW;
Page 10 of II
Ordinance # 14 Amended November 18, 2019
3) Any hazardous waste listed or designated under Env-Hw 400 NH Hazardous Waste
Rules.
Due to the extreme toxicity of the chemical agents used in cleaning hood vents, all
material must be contained, captured, and disposed of into an approved sanitary
drain or hauled offsite to an approved disposal facility in order to insure this wastewater
does not enter the environment.
Any spills or stains as a result of cleaning operations shall be immediately cleaned up in
a manner that prevents contaminated water from reaching the Towns stormwater system.
Contracted cleaning shall be performed in accordance with all applicable safety
guidelines including Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) guidelines.
Hood and exhaust cleaning shall be performed in accordance with NFP A 96

maintenance and landscaping is provided by the Public Works Department.
Enforcement supervision and two-way radio communications are provided by
the Police Department. These services are funded under the General Fund
and charged to the Parking System on a charge-back arrangement.
D. Revenue to the Parking System comes from meter revenue, parking enforcement
fines, monthly parking space rental fees, charges to others for shuttle bus operation,
shuttle bus rider fees, rental of air rights over a municipal lot, and interest earned
from investment of available cash. All such revenues are paid into a parking fund
which is separate and distinct from the Town General Fund.
E. The shuttle bus system is proposed to be funded by Dartmouth College;
Dartmouth Medical School; Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center; and the Town, in
such proportions as mutually agreed upon. The Town's share will be an expense of
the Parking System.
6. Annual Budget for the Parking System: The Selectmen shall prepare and
present in advance of the Annual Town Meeting, a budget of anticipated expenditures and
income for the Parking System. A public hearing shall be held on the proposed budget.
Notice shall be given at least ten (10) calendar days before the public hearing, not including
the day the notice is posted or the day of the public hearing. Notice shall be published in
the Valley News, a newspaper circulating in Hanover, and shall be posted in at least two (2)
public places. The notice shall also indicate where a copy of the budget is on file for public
inspection.

expenses for the operation of the Parking System within the District to be
paid by the Central Business Parking Districts shall be at least fifty percent
(50%). The remainder of the net expenses shall be paid by taxes assessed on
all real estate in Town. The net expenses shall be divided between the
Districts so that eighty-five percent (85%) of these expenses shall be paid by
CBPD1 and fifteen percent (15%) of these net expenses shall be paid by

paragraph 5 shall be reviewed annually at the same time as the public hearing

3/25/11 Page 3
8. Allocation Between Fees and Taxes: The amount of net expenses to be paid
by the Central Business Parking Districts shall be obtained as follows: fifty percent (50%)
from parking space fees and fifty percent (50%) from a special service area tax on
properties within the Central Business Parking District. This allocation has been made after
consideration of the criteria contained in the Town Charter, Section 17a, VII.
9. Inventory of Off-Street Parking Requirements: The Selectmen shall establish
a separate inventory setting forth the off-street parking requirements for each property in
each District by using as a measure the off-street parking requirements set forth in the Town
Zoning Ordinance regardless of whether or not such requirements apply under the Town
Zoning Ordinance to any particular property. The Zoning Administrator shall make the
determinations with regard to off-street parking requirements and shall include as a credit
any off-street parking spaces located on a lot other than the building served, as authorized
by a special exception from the Zoning Board of Adjustment. An individual property
required off-street parking spaces as reduced by the number of such parking spaces actually
provided as of the first day of April in each year, shall be the "Adjusted Parking
Requirement."
A. Report of Changes: It shall be the obligation of each property owner to
provide to the Zoning Administrator in writing, prior to April 1 of each year,
notification of any changes to the number of parking spaces actually provided,
including a description of the location of all off-street parking spaces. The purpose
of this provision is to ensure that parking space fees are determined based on correct
and current information.
B. Appeal of Adjusted Parking Requirement: After the determination of the offstreet
parking requirements for each property by the Zoning Administrator, the
property owner shall have the right to appeal that decision to the Board of Selectmen
if it is claimed that such calculation is not in conformity with this Ordinance. The
Board of Selectmen shall hear the appeal at a public meeting and shall give notice to
the property owner and the public in the same manner as notice in paragraph 6.
10. Parking Space Fee/Lien/Adjustments: The parking space fee for each
property in the Districts shall be equal to the proportionate share that each property's
Adjusted Parking Requirements bears to the total Adjusted Parking Requirements for all
property in each District. All such parking space fees shall become a lien upon the property
so charged and such lien may be enforced by a lawsuit on behalf of the Town ordered by the
Selectmen against the owner or owners of such property. The record in the office of the
Selectmen and the charges for the parking space fee set forth therein shall be sufficient
notice to maintain a lawsuit upon such lien against the subsequent purchasers or attaching
creditors of such real estate. In the event that the off-street parking requirements set forth in
the Town Zoning Ordinance are amended, then the inventory of off-street parking
requirements for each property in the proper District shall be adjusted accordingly as of
3/25/11 Page 4
April 1 of the year following the amendment.
11. Boundary Changes: Changes in the boundaries of either District shall be
made by the Selectmen from time to time as a result of the change in nature of the property
in the area or the services provided. Such changes may be made by the Selectmen upon
thirty (30) days written notice of the proposed change being sent first class mail to the last
known address on the tax rolls of the owners of each of the properties affected. Such
changes shall not be effective until after a public hearing. Notice shall be given at least ten
(10) calendar days before the public hearing, not including the day the notice is posted or
the day of the public hearing. Notice shall be published in the Valley News, a newspaper
circulating in Hanover, and shall be posted in at least two (2) public places. The notice
shall also indicate where a copy of the boundary changes is on file for public inspection.
12. Inventory of Districts' Properties: The Selectmen shall establish a separate
inventory listing the properties in each Parking District for the purpose of assessment of
taxes.
13. Amendment of this Ordinance: This Ordinance may be amended after notice
and public hearing. Notice of the public hearing shall be given by posting a copy of the
notice, including a copy of the proposed amendment, at the Municipal Building at least ten
(10) days prior to the hearing, not including the day the notice is posted or the day of the
public hearing. Notice shall be published in the Valley News, a newspaper circulating in
Hanover, and shall be posted in at least two (2) public places. The notice shall also indicate
where a copy of the amendment to the Ordinance is on file for public inspection.

TOWN OF HANOVER
ORDINANCE OF THE BOARD OF SELECTMEN
The Board of Selectmen of Hanover, New Hampshire, ordain as follows:
CONTROL OF DUTCH ELM DISEASE
1. Declaration of Purpose: The Board of Selectmen recognize the aesthetic
value of elm trees to the Town of Hanover. Such trees make a substantial contribution to
the attractive appearance of our community. In order to preserve and protect these valuable
trees, it is determined to be necessary to provide for the spraying, feeding or the removal or
pruning and limbing of diseased elm trees located on both public and private property as
part of the Dutch Elm Disease Program. Unless the Town requires sanitation which
involves the elimination of diseased elm wood, all other supplemental control measures will
be ineffective.
2. Title: This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the “Control of
Dutch Elm Disease Ordinance of the Town of Hanover.”
3. Authority:
4. Control Area. This Ordinance shall apply to elm trees located on public and
private property within the area of the Town as shown on the attached map marked
Appendix A and made a part of this Ordinance. (Hereinafter referred to as the "control
area".)
5. Administrator. The Manager shall appoint a person to administer the
sanitation program required under this Ordinance. The Administrator shall have the right to
enter on private property for the purpose of performing the duties hereinafter set forth. In
the event that the Administrator is refused an entry, then the Administrator shall have the
right to apply for a search warrant as provided under law so as to carry out such duties.
3/25/11 Page 2
6. Diseased Elm Trees on Town Property and/or Rights-of-Way. The
Administrator shall prepare an inventory of all elm trees located on Town property and/or
rights-of-way and shall schedule the spraying, feeding or removal or pruning and limbing of
any such elm trees as may be required under the appropriate sanitation procedure. Such
control measures shall be coordinated with all other appropriate Town Departments and
Agencies through the Manager. Continual inspection of elm trees listed on the inventory
will be as required under the control program.
7. Diseased Elm Trees on Private Property. It is necessary to apply sanitation
procedures to diseased elms on private property otherwise all other control procedures will
be useless because the Dutch Elm Disease will continue to spread to trees on Town and
other private property.
A. Inventory. The Administrator shall prepare an inventory of all elm trees on private
property in the control area.
B. Determination. The Administrator shall determine which elm trees on this private
inventory require sanitation measures, removal or maintenance.
C. Notices. The private landowner shall be given a written notice of such measures that
the Town intends to take as may be required in the opinion of the Administrator. The
notice will be delivered or mailed by first class mail to the landowner. Notices to
non-resident landowners will be by certified mail, return receipt requested. In any
such notice the Administrator shall indicate the action described therein to be carried
out by a specific date but not before the expiration of 30 days from the date of the
notice. The notice will include a statement that all costs will be paid by the Town.
D. Expense. The expense of the control measures as set forth in this Ordinance shall
be borne by the Town to the extent that funds are made available as appropriated by
the Town at the Annual Town Meeting.
E. Enforcement and Penalty. The Manager, with the advice of the Administrator, shall
initiate action against any person who does not comply with any notice or order
given hereunder by filing a complaint in the Hanover District Court or taking such
other action as may be available either at law or in equity in any court. The penalty
for the violation of this ordinance shall be a fine not to exceed $100 and each day
that a person is found to be in violation may be considered a separate offense.
3/25/11 Page 3
7. Diseased Elm Trees on Private Property (continued)
F. Emergency Procedures. If the Administrator determines that emergency sanitation
procedures must be taken immediately as to elm trees located on private property
then the Administrator shall have the authority to cause such sanitation measures to
be taken without complying with the procedures set forth in Paragraph 7 A-C above,
with the approval of the Manager.
8. Records. In addition to maintaining an Elm Tree Inventory of all public and
private elms in the control area as defined by Appendix A, the Town Manager will maintain
records of the control measures taken on each tree and their results and he will annually
prepare an analysis of the effectiveness of the program to be presented to the Selectmen and
the public.
9. Effective Date. This Ordinance shall become effective after approval by the
Board of Selectmen and on the next day following the publication of this Ordinance in the
newspaper "Valley News".
10. Expiration Date. This Ordinance shall expire three years from the effective
date unless readopted prior thereto.

207.3 The Zoning Board of Adjustment may approve a use by special exception on
property in the NP district only after determining that trees will be selectively cut so as to
assure adequate stocking of residual growth and that any general plan prepared by the
owner for the selective cutting of trees has been approved in writing by the County
Forester or other qualified forester.
207.4 In addition to the general and specific standards established by this Ordinance, the
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall impose upon the approval of a special exception such
additional conditions as it finds reasonably appropriate to safeguard the neighborhood or
otherwise serve the purposes of the Ordinance, including, but not being limited to, the
following:
A. Setbacks larger than the minimums required by the Ordinance;
B. Screening of part or all of the premises of the proposed use by walls, fencing, or
planting;
C. Modification of the design of any building involved in the proposed use;
D. Parking spaces greater in number than those otherwise required under this
Ordinance;
E. Limitation of the number of occupants or employees upon the premises and
restrictions of the method of operation, the time of operation and use, and the size
or extent of facilities; and
F. Limitations upon the size, location, and lighting of signs more restrictive than
those otherwise imposed by this Ordinance, including the prohibition of signs
where, in the opinion of the Board, their display would be contrary to the
purposes of the Ordinance.
208 Variance
208.1 The Zoning Board of Adjustment may, on an appeal, grant a variance from the
provisions of this Ordinance, if the applicant produces evidence to support a finding of
each of the following facts by the Zoning Board of Adjustment:
A. The variance will not be contrary to the public interest;
B. The spirit of the Ordinance is observed;
C. Substantial justice is done;
D. The values of surrounding properties are not diminished; and
E. Literal enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance would result in an
unnecessary hardship.
(1) For purposes of this subparagraph, “unnecessary hardship” means that,
owing to special conditions of the property that distinguish it from other
properties in the area:
a. No fair and substantial relationship exists between the general public
purposes of the Ordinance provision and the specific application of that
provision to the property; and
b. The proposed use is a reasonable one.
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 8
(2) If the criteria in subparagraph (1) are not established, an unnecessary
hardship will be deemed to exist, if, and only if, owing to special conditions
of the property that distinguish it from other properties in the area, the
property cannot be reasonably used in strict conformance with the Ordinance,
and a variance is therefore necessary to enable a reasonable use of it. The
definition of “unnecessary hardship” set forth in subparagraph E applies
whether the provision of the Ordinance from which a variance is sought is a
restriction on use, a dimensional or other limitation on a permitted use, or
any other requirement of the Ordinance.
208.2 In authorizing a variance, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may attach such
conditions and safeguards as it deems necessary to protect the neighborhood and the
community, including but not limited to a time limit when the variance will expire if not
utilized.
209 Variance from the provisions of Article XI, Protection of Flood Plains,
Waterbodies, and Wetlands
The Zoning Board of Adjustment may on an appeal grant a variance from the provisions
of Article XI, Protection of Flood Plains, Waterbodies, and Wetlands as follows:
A. No variance may be issued within the floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
B. A variance may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to
be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by
lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level in conformity
with the procedures of subsections C, D, E, and F set forth below.
C. A variance may be issued only upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a
determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant and a determination that the granting of the variance will
not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, or create nuisances, cause fraud on or a
victimization of the public, or conflict with any other applicable existing Town
Ordinances.
D. A variance may be issued only upon a determination by the Zoning Board of
Adjustment that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood
hazard to afford relief.
E. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing that the issuance of
a variance to construct the structure below the base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance and such construction below the base
flood level increases risk to life and property. Such notification must be
maintained with a record of all variance actions.
F. A variance may be issued only upon a determination by the Zoning Board of
Adjustment that the applicant has demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increases in flood levels within
the community during the base flood discharge.
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 9
G. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a record of all variances and
justification for their issuance and shall report such variances issued in an annual
report to be submitted to the Administrator of the Federal Insurance
Administration.
210 Variance to accommodate disabilities
210.1 The Zoning Board of Adjustment may grant a variance from the terms of this
Ordinance without finding hardship arising from the condition of a premises subject to
the Ordinance when reasonable accommodations are necessary to allow a person or
persons with a recognized physical disability to reside in or regularly use the premises
provided that the Zoning Board of Adjustment:
A. Determines that any variance granted under these provisions is in harmony with
the general purpose and intent of this Ordinance and
B. Requires that the owner of the premises pay to the Town of Hanover all costs of
recording the notice of action regarding such variance in the Grafton County
Registry of Deeds, such recording to be done by the Town of Hanover.
210.2 The Zoning Board of Adjustment may stipulate in the finding and the notice of
action included in the variance that the variance granted pursuant to these provisions
survives only as long as the particular person has a continuing need to use the premises.
210.3 A temporary permit may be issued by the Zoning Administrator, under Section
515, to allow the use of a temporary access structure, such as a handicap ramp, to enable
a disabled individual to more easily and safely enter and exit a residence.
211 Equitable waiver of dimensional requirement
211.1 When a lot or other division of land or structure thereupon is discovered to be in
violation of a physical layout or dimensional requirement of this Ordinance, the Zoning
Board of Adjustment may, upon application by and with the burden of proof on the
property owner, grant an equitable waiver from the requirement, provided that the Zoning
Board of Adjustment makes all of the following findings:
A. That the violation was not noticed or discovered by any owner, former owner,
owner’s agent or representative, or municipal official until after a structure in
violation had been substantially completed or until after a lot or other division of
land in violation had been subdivided by conveyance to a bona fide purchaser for
value;
B. That the violation was not an outcome of ignorance of the law or Ordinance or
failure to inquire, obfuscation, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the part of any
owner or owner’s agent or representative, but was instead caused by either a good
faith error in measurement or calculation made by an owner or owner’s agent or
by an error in Ordinance interpretation or applicability made by a municipal
official in the process of issuing a permit over which that official had authority;
C. That the physical or dimensional violation does not constitute a public or private
nuisance nor diminish the value of other property in the area nor interfere with or
adversely affect any present or permissible future uses of any such property; and
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 10
D. That due to the degree of past construction or investment made in ignorance of the
facts constituting the violation, the cost of correction so far outweighs any public
benefit to be gained that it would be inequitable to require the violation to be
corrected.
211.2 In lieu of the findings required by the Zoning Board of Adjustment under
subparagraphs 211.1 A and B, the owner may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board
that the violation has existed for ten years or more, and that no enforcement action,
including written notice of violation, has been commenced against the violation during
that time by the municipality or any person directly affected.
211.3 Application and hearing procedures for equitable waivers under this section are
governed by RSA 676:5 through 7. Rehearings and appeals are governed by RSA 677:2
through 14.
211.4 Waivers may be granted under this section only from physical layout and
mathematical or dimensional requirements and not from use restrictions. An equitable
waiver granted under this section may not be construed as a nonconforming use, and does
not exempt future use, construction, reconstruction, or additions on the property from full
compliance with the Ordinance. This section may not be construed to alter the principle
that owners of land are bound by constructive knowledge of all applicable requirements.
This section may not be construed to impose upon municipal officials any duty to
guarantee the correctness of plans reviewed by them or property inspected by them.

is to provide an area for office, research, and light manufacturing where public water

Greensboro Roads fronted by residential uses; consequently, uses resulting in
negative traffic impacts on these neighborhoods are discouraged. Steep, rocky terrain,
wetlands, and the Mink Brook corridor surround the district, and these characteristics
limit expansion of it. The area fronting Route 120 is more amenable to higher volume
traffic access and to public transportation.

needs of community residents, students, and tourists, and to promote a
complementary and diverse mix of downtown housing. Therefore, to be discouraged
are warehouses as principal uses, adult or other sexually-oriented retail or
entertainment businesses, heavy industry, sawmills, or contractors’ or maintenance
yards, or the like.
The D district is divided into two parts: D-1 Downtown Center, and D-2 Downtown
Edge. The uses and special exceptions are generally the same for the two districts, but

and police protection and community water and sewer service are provided, where the
public street and sidewalk infrastructure is sufficiently available, and where

405.6 Institution (I)
A. Objective: The chief present land use in this district, and the use that can be
expected in the future, is institutional. This use has certain peculiar needs that best
can be met by identifying it as a special district. In addition to the normal institutional
uses in this area, certain complementary and support facilities are desirable as special
exceptions. Because of the specialized nature of these institutions, these support and
complementary land uses involve a selective list of residential commercial and public
uses which are desirable in such a district providing the necessary safeguards are
incorporated. It is the intent of this provision to permit or allow institutions to use
their land for uses related to the purposes of the institutions.
B. Uses: all uses in the I district, whether permitted or allowed only by special
exception, must relate to the uses of the institution having ownership interest in land
in the district.

405.7 General Residence (GR)
A. Objective: Within any community that has a built-up area with organized
community services such as fire and police protection and community water and
sewer service, it is necessary to provide areas for high and moderate density
residential dwellings in a range of dwelling units from single family to multi-family.
The location of these units depends on the readily available community services and
the existing or potential servicing of these areas by public water and sewer systems.
Thus, these areas are found within or adjacent to the presently built-up area of the
community. Four districts in the General Residence district are provided for. These
districts have similar uses and special exceptions, with additional residential uses
permitted in the GR-3 and GR-4 districts. The GR districts have different lot and
planned residential development (PRD) regulations depending upon their
accessibility, present density, and relationship to certain municipal services and
facilities.
B. Uses are permitted only if all area and dimensional requirements in the table below
are met.
Permitted uses: Uses allowed by special exception:
1. One-family dwelling 1. Child day care agency

uses will be permitted. These types of uses not only complement the single-family
homes, but serve these homes as well. Three districts are provided in the Single
Residence designation. In each of the districts, similar uses are allowed, but there are
varying lot regulations depending on the location of the district’s present land
development, and its relation to surrounding districts.

405.9 Rural Residence (RR)
A. Objective: The Rural Residence district provides for the building of one-family
dwellings outside of the built up section of the community where public water and
sewer service are not generally available. Along with the rural residential use, other
prime uses of the area are Forestry and Agriculture. As a special exception, certain
other residential uses, special types of facilities, certain commercial establishments
that are desirable in a rural area, and governmental facilities are provided for.

405.10 Forestry and Recreation (F)
A. Objective: Much of Hanover, due to its steep slopes, remoteness, types of soils and
similar limiting factors, should have a very low intensity of use in order not to
permanently damage the land and not to cause undue burdens on the Town for
providing municipal services. In these areas, the primary land use will be forestry
with some agricultural operations. Another acceptable land use for such an area is
recreation, mainly of the outdoor type. Residential use, because of the inaccessibility
and remoteness of much of this land, is limited to seasonal dwellings and then only as
a special exception. Certain other land uses in selected areas of the Forestry District
will be allowed as special exceptions, including certain limited commercial,
recreational pursuits, removal of earth and other limited governmental and
commercial activities that will not be harmful to the area.
It is intended that land in the F District shall not be used for occupancy on any
continuing basis that would require public services including furnishing
transportation for school purposes or furnishing police and fire protection except for
buildings used for second or vacation homes.
B. Uses:

(4) Maximum building height: 30 feet, which may be increased to 40 feet for nonhabitable
outdoor recreation structures only
D. New roads, public or private, are not permitted in order to avoid the excessive costs
of road maintenance, snow removal, and school transportation.

405.11 Natural Preserve (NP)
A. Objective: Fragile and unique land areas should have the least intensity of use. They
can support on a limited basis certain outdoor recreational activities and associated
uses. Most of these areas have been acquired by the Town of Hanover for the purpose
of preserving said areas in their natural state for recreation, conservation, education,
and protection of scenery, woodlands, wetlands, ponds, stream banks, and steep
slopes. Town owned lands are held and utilized consistent with the purposes of New
Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated (RSA) 36-A and shall be under the
supervision of the Hanover Conservation Commission. Other land in this district has
been designated by the landowner for inclusion in such a district. Uses will be
prohibited in this district that are inconsistent with the conservation of scenic
characteristics and ecological processes.

405.12 Goose Pond Zoning District (GP)
A. Objective: The Goose Pond zoning district is established to distinguish the unique
neighborhood around Goose Pond from surrounding areas. The Goose Pond district is
an area of traditional seasonal summer camps and cottages that surround and front on
Goose Pond. The primary land use is seasonal residences whose inhabitants use
Goose Pond and the surrounding area recreationally. Therefore, reliable water quality,
Class B or better, in Goose Pond is critical to the continued recreational use of the
Pond and to the wildlife which lives in and around the pond. The residential use of
Goose Pond was established and developed prior to town-wide zoning. Upon
adoption of the first town-wide zoning, the Goose Pond area was classified with the
Forestry district. The Goose Pond area is sufficiently distinct from the Forestry
district with respect to use, building size and configuration, lot size, residential
density and proximity to the waterfront of Goose Pond that a new zoning district is
appropriate. The geographical boundaries of the Goose Pond district reflect these
distinctions.
(1) The Goose Pond District is fully subdivided and increases in either the density of
residences or additional uses are prohibited. District regulations have been
established to ensure these restrictions will be enforced.
(2) Uses permitted in the area are consistent with the dominant seasonal residential
use and strong orientation to Goose Pond. Recognizing that residents are
concerned with the quiet enjoyment of their property and the pond, commercial
uses and other uses that are acceptable in the surrounding Forestry district are not
compatible with this concept. Of paramount importance is maintaining the water
quality in Goose Pond so that it is safe for swimming and other water based
recreational activities and can support a healthy aquatic ecosystem. Therefore,
the use of NH DES approved advanced septic technology in lieu of traditional
leach fields is encouraged.
B. Uses:
Permitted uses: Uses allowed by special exception:
1. Seasonal dwelling 1. Essential service
2. Use accessory to permitted use 2. Use accessory to special exception
C. Area and dimension: for waterfront lots:
(1) Minimum lot area: 21,570 square feet

(4) Minimum side and rear setbacks: 10 feet
(5) Minimum setback from top of bank: 50 feet
(6) Maximum building height: 24 feet, measured from the Goose Pond waterfront
side of the building
(7) Maximum aggregate building footprint: may not exceed 5.5 % of the lot area or
1200 square feet, whichever is the smaller number
(8) Maximum lot coverage: 8%

(6) Maximum aggregate building footprint: may not exceed 5.5 % of the lot area
expressed in square feet or 1200 square feet, whichever is the smaller number
(7) Maximum lot coverage: 8%
E. Other restrictions:
(1) No new lot may be created in the Goose Pond district, except that lot mergers
and boundary line adjustments that do not make a lot more non-conforming are
permitted.
(2) In recognition that many waterfront lots cannot reasonably accommodate
development respecting the 75 foot water resource buffer set forth in Section
1103, waterfront lots in the Goose Pond District may be developed as follows:
a. Excepting water dependent structures, new structures on waterfront lots must
be 50 feet from the top of the bank of Goose Pond.
b. On a waterfront lot, any addition to an existing building or replacement
structure shall be either:
(i) No closer than 50 feet from the edge of Goose Pond; or
(ii) Located on the existing footprint; or
(iii) Located no closer to Goose Pond than the closest point of the existing
building edge that is farthest from and most nearly parallel to Goose
Pond.
c. In addition to New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services review
and approval, all new and replacement septic systems shall also be reviewed
pursuant to Section 1102.7.
d. No deck or porch may be enclosed unless it is a minimum of 50 feet from the
top of the bank of Goose Pond.

406 Overlay districts
406.1 The Flood Plain overlay district is established by and in accordance with Article
XI of the Ordinance.
406.2 West End Neighborhood Overlay District
A. There is hereby created the West End Neighborhood Overlay district. The boundaries
of the West End Neighborhood Overlay district are established on the map entitled
“West End Neighborhood,” which is on file in the offices of the Town of Hanover
and is hereby made part of this Ordinance. For purposes of identification, the
signature of the Director of the Office of Planning and Zoning as of the date of
adoption is indicated.
B. The West End Neighborhood Overlay District is established to achieve the following
objectives:
(1) To protect the distinctive characteristics of the neighborhood’s character and
streetscapes as those of a New England small town, in a manner that is supported
by Hanover’s Master Plan;
(2) To encourage change and reinvestment within the neighborhood in a manner that
reinforces its existing character and streetscapes; and
(3) To retain and enhance the pedestrian-friendly nature of neighborhood
streetscapes through an emphasis on pedestrian entries, windows facing the
street, active living space oriented to the street, and garages and blank walls
oriented away from the street, consistent with prevailing patterns in the
neighborhood.
C. All new construction must conform to the following developmental standards:
(1) Any garages proposed to be built, relocated or expanded, must be located behind
or beneath the principal building or perpendicular to the side of the principal
building with vehicular openings not facing the street, or, if located with
vehicular openings facing the street, whether attached to or detached from the
principal building, be set back at least three feet from the building front line of
the principal building. Vehicular openings may be no greater than one-third the
overall width of the entire street elevation. For purposes of this section, a lot may
have only one building front line and that line is on the side with a pedestrian
entrance.
(2) Buildings must face the street so that windows and the main pedestrian entrance
will be visible from and oriented to the street. Windows and pedestrian doorways
must comprise a minimum of 15 percent of the front building walls facing the
street excluding the roof but including roof dormers with vertical windows.
Fenestration patterns must be designed so as to avoid blank garage walls facing
the street.
(3) Buildings may not be set back farther from the street than the average set back of
the residential properties on the same side of the block.

(4) The front setback is established by the principal building that exists on the lot
as of May 8, 2012. If there is no building on the lot, the front setback is
established by the provisions of Section 504.2 front setbacks.
(5) Unenclosed, unscreened porches with roofs may project eight feet into the
required front yard setback, but may be no closer than ten feet to the front
property line.

ARTICLE V. GENERAL PROVISIONS
501 Lots
501.1 A lot must be of sufficient size to meet the requirements of this Ordinance for use,
coverage, area, setback allowance, and open space and will have frontage on an improved
public street or other means of access approved in accordance with New Hampshire
statute. Every lot created by subdivision or lot line adjustment must meet the
requirements of this Ordinance.
501.2 No lot may be reduced in area, setbacks, frontage, coverage, or any other
dimension so that the requirements established for the district or districts in which it is
located cannot be met, except when part of the lot is taken for public purpose.
501.3 A lot, including those on the turnaround portion of a cul-de-sac, must be of such a
dimension as to permit the placement within the lot of a square box each side of which is
equal to the minimum frontage requirement established for the zoning district in which
the lot is located.
501.4 A lot that meets the requirements of this Ordinance in effect at the time the lot was
created may be used for any use permitted or allowed by special exception in this
Ordinance for the zoning district in which the lot is located, subject to any area
requirements established by this Ordinance.
501.5 All lots shown on a subdivision plan that has received final plat approval from the
Planning Board are separate lots regardless of whether there is separate ownership or
common ownership of contiguous lots.
502 Lot area
502.1 The calculation of the size of a lot includes the total horizontal land and waterbody
area within the boundaries of a lot, including steep slopes, except as provided below.
A. For the purpose of calculating density for major subdivisions in the RR district,
lot size excludes 100 percent of the area occupied by water bodies, flood plains,
wetlands, and any steep slope area. Land subject to two or more overlapping
reductions counts as a single exclusion.
B. For any new subdivision, the calculation of the size of each lot includes lands
with non-steep slopes whose total area must be at least 75 percent of the
applicable minimum lot area requirement. At least 75 percent of any gross tract
area to which a residential density factor is being applied must consist of lands
with slopes no steeper than 25 percent. These minimum non-steep areas will be
increased if necessary to accommodate areas of sufficient size and configuration
for all required utilities such as sewage disposal and water supply; for lots or
tracts with on-site septic tank and leach fields, such non-steep areas must include
locations for both a primary and secondary leach field.

503 Lot Frontage
503.1 The frontage of a lot is measured along its common boundary with a street line.
Minimum lot frontage is measured along a contiguous, uninterrupted boundary line.
503.2 Notwithstanding minimum lot frontages required by this Ordinance, the minimum
street frontage required for lots on the turnaround portion of a cul-de-sac in all districts is
80 feet. A lot is considered to be on the turnaround portion of a cul-de-sac if 50 percent
or more of the lot frontage is located on the turnaround portion.
503.3 A lot that abuts more than one street must provide the required minimum frontage
along every abutting street, except that in the D districts the minimum lot frontage is
required on no more than two streets. Any portion of a lot abutting a street is considered a
front yard for the purposes of this Ordinance.
504 Setbacks
504.1 Every part of a required setback must be open from grade level to the sky,
unobstructed, with the following exceptions:
A. Ordinary projections of sills, cornices, pilasters, chimneys, and eaves may extend
up to two feet into any required setback.
B. Bus shelters and public utility structures or equipment, including but not limited
to water and wastewater treatment and filtration plants and appurtenances that
because of function cannot reasonably be located elsewhere may be located
wholly or partially within a required setback.
C. A garage, carport, or any accessory building, whether or not attached to the
principal structure, not exceeding 15 feet in height and no part of which is used as
a dwelling space, as well as a deck, patio, swimming pool or tennis court, may be
located within the side or rear setback, but not closer than ten feet to the side or
rear lot line. This exception does not apply to any lot within the BM, B, D, OL, or
I district that adjoins a residential district.
504.2 The following standards govern front setbacks.
A. Any lot line contiguous to a street is deemed to be a front lot line; a lot fronting on
two streets has two front lot lines, two side lot lines, and no rear lot line; a lot
fronting on three streets is deemed to have three front lot lines, one side lot line,
and no rear lot line.
B. No building may be built nearer to any street line than the minimum front setback
specified in Article IV, with the following exception: where the average front
building line setback of the existing buildings, provided there are at least two on
the same side of the street in the same block, but not more than 300 feet distant
along the street from the subject lot, is less than the depth specified in Article IV,
such average setback is the required front setback.
C. No structure, whether attached to the principal structure or not, whether open or
enclosed, and whether above or at previously existing grade level, may project
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 51
into a required front setback specified in Article IV, including porches, carports,
balconies or platforms, with the following exceptions:
(1) Driveways;
(2) Signs;
(3) The growing and cultivation of trees, shrubs, flowers, and gardens not
conducted as gainful business;
(4) Elements in the D, RO, OL and GR-4 districts, including entrances, awnings,
colonnades, porches, balconies, and bay windows, may, provided that such
elements:
a. Do not project into the front setback along the building’s frontage more
than 35 percent of that building’s frontage,
b. Do not intrude upon an existing or future ten-foot sidewalk located within
the setback, and
c. In the RO, OL and GR-4 districts, protrude no more than five feet into the
setback;
(5) Utility connections that protrude above grade;
(6) Structures that are entirely below finished grade, or in the case of
underground structures that are above- and below-grade, to the underground
portion of such structures;
(7) In the D and I districts, additional elements that project into the required front
setback area on properties to which the Downtown Area Setback Map
pertains, provided that such elements do not intrude upon an existing or
future ten-foot sidewalk located within the setback.
(8) Produce stands; and
(9) Unenclosed, unscreened porches with roofs in the West End Neighborhood
Overlay district, pursuant to 405.
505 Height standards for buildings and other structures
505.1 The height of any building is the vertical distance measured from the average
elevation of the proposed finished grade at the front of the building to the highest point of
the roof for flat and mansard roofs, not including any parapet less than two feet high, and
to the average height between the eaves and the ridge for other types of roofs including
the upper slope of gambrel roofs.
A. The maximum building height for a building in the B or D-1 district may be
increased to 50 feet by special exception, and the maximum building height for a
building in the BM or OL district may be increased to 60 feet by special
exception, provided that the following conditions are met and become conditions
of the special exception approval.
(1) Plans for the building have been submitted to the Hanover Fire Department
or that town official properly designated for the enforcement of the
appropriate construction, fire prevention, and life safety codes at least 15
days in advance of the hearing requesting a special exception. Plans must be
furnished in such detail as is necessary to allow the Fire Chief to prepare
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 52
comments concerning compliance of the proposed construction with those
ordinances related to fire resistant construction and safety.
(2) No part of the building in excess of any height established for the district is
closer than 50 feet to any district boundary other than a common boundary
shared by D-1, D-2, or I districts.
(3) Appropriate open space is maintained in association with the excepted
building. The floor area ratio may not exceed three, and the open space ratio
may not be less than four. Of the open space, not more than one-third may be
used for walks, drives and parking areas.
(4) The proposed building is not located or designed so as to obstruct or
materially impair a view or vista of outstanding distinction unless the Zoning
Board of Adjustment finds that the intended function of the building, either
alone or in relation to other facilities, precludes any change in its proposed
design or location that would be more consistent with preserving the view or
vista involved.
(5) The excess height will not adversely affect unduly, adjacent property owners
or the Town by blocking light or air, or by inducing undue traffic congestion
on public streets in the vicinity.
(6) The building height measured from any face other than the front may not be
in excess of 15 feet above the maximum building height allowable in any
district under the provisions of this subsection.
(7) The special exception sought is otherwise appropriate under any other
applicable provisions of this Ordinance.
B. (1) To allow heights of buildings within 150 feet of a public street in the I district
to conform with the site topography, height of the front face of such
buildings may not exceed 60 feet as measured for buildings generally. Where
such a building is located on land that slopes downward from the street, no
other point on the building face may exceed 75 feet as measured from any
point of finished grade directly up to the highest point of the roof for flat and
mansard roofs, not including any parapet less than two feet high, and to the
average height between the eaves and the ridge for other types of roofs
including the upper slope of gambrel roofs. Where such a building is located
on land that slopes upward from the street, no other point on any building
face may exceed 60 feet as measured from any point of finished grade
directly up to the highest point of the roof for flat and mansard roofs, not
including any parapet less than two feet high, and to the average height
between the eaves and the ridge for other types of roofs including the upper
slope of gambrel roofs. The exceptions provided in Section 505.2 apply.
(2) In the Institution zone for buildings not within 150' of a public street and
located on a sloping site, uppermost building height on the uphill side of the
building shall not exceed sixty (60) feet (as defined under Section 505.1
above).
No other point on any building face shall exceed seventy-five (75) feet as measured from
any point of finished grade directly up to the highest point of the roof for flat and
mansard roofs, not including any parapet less than 2 feet high, and to the average height
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 53
between the eaves and the ridge for other types of roofs including the upper slope of
gambrel roofs.
The exceptions provided in Section 505.2 apply.
505.2 The height of structures other than buildings is the vertical distance measured from
the ground level at the base of the structure to the highest point of the structure, including
any antenna on the structure.
A. Flagpoles may extend no more than 20 feet above the building height limit
established for the district.
B. Chimneys, spires, and lightning rods located on a principal structure may extend
above the building height limit established for the district, but may not extend
more than 20 feet above the roof of the principal structure.
C. The total area of all towers, theatrical stage houses, mechanical penthouses or like
superstructures not used for human occupancy, located on a principal structure,
may not exceed 80 percent of the area of the floor immediately beneath and may
not extend more than 20 feet above the building height limit established for the
district.
D. Free-standing chimneys over 15 feet in height are permitted only by special
exception.
E. Radio or TV antennae for private, non-commercial reception may extend above
the building height limit established for the district and may be located on the roof
of a principal structure, but not be located in the required front, side, or rear
setback.
F. In the D and I zoning districts, building-mounted solar energy systems may
extend no more than 20 feet above the building height limit established for the
district.
G. In all districts except the D and I zoning districts, ground-mounted solar energy
systems may not exceed the maximum building height established for the district.
506 Open space standards
506.1 Required open space must generally be unfragmented, contiguous, and continuous,
that is, not interrupted by buildings, roads, driveways or other improvements that support
development of the site. Smaller, discrete areas of open space on the development parcel
may be considered open space when such areas serve the open space goals of the
Hanover Master Plan and when the small area contributes to the protection of natural
features that cross a property line or when such an area serves the open space needs of the
residents of the development.
506.2 Space required under these regulations to satisfy area, setback or other open space
requirements in relation to one building are not counted as part of a required open space
for any other building.
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 54
507 Lots in more than one district
507.1 Where a zoning district boundary line crosses a lot of record at the time such line is
adopted, the requirements of this Ordinance for a district apply to that portion of the lot
included in that district, except that a less restrictive requirement may be extended not
more than 30 feet (100 feet in the RR district) into the portion of the lot under greater
restriction, provided that the lot has frontage on a street in the less restrictive district.
507.2 A new lot may be created, whether by subdivision, lot line adjustment or by
merger, with land in more than one zoning district provided only that the portions of land
in each zoning district within the new lot separately meet the area requirement for that
zoning district, as defined in Article IV, in which they reside. This applies only when part
of the land used to create a new lot is located in the F, NP or RR district. The land in each
district will be used only for those uses permitted, or allowed by Special Exception, for
that district.
508 Conservation lot
The designation of a lot as conservation lot must be approved by the Planning Board,
which may waive the minimum lot frontage required for the district, provided that the
following conditions are met:
A. The lot has adequate access, either by road frontage or by access deeded in fee or
by easement, as approved by the Planning Board.
B. The lot is protected permanently through the grant of a conservation easement to a
governmental agency or a conservation organization approved by the Planning
Board in consultation with the Conservation Commission. Such conservation
easement will restrict the uses of the lot to silviculture, agriculture, and noncommercial
outdoor recreation conducted in accordance with recognized
conservation practices and will otherwise be in form and substance satisfactory to
the Planning Board in consultation with the Conservation Commission.
509 Classification of lots by water source and sewage system
509.1 Lots in the OL, GR, SR, and BM districts are classified with respect to water
supply and sewage disposal as follows:
Class 1 Off-lot water and sewage disposal
Class 2 Off-lot water or sewage disposal
Class 3 On-lot water and sewage disposal
509.2 In considering an application for the construction of one or more dwelling units on
a lot in the OL, GR, SR, or BM district, the Zoning Administrator shall first determine
the classification of the lot in accordance with this section and:
A. In an application for a single dwelling unit on a single lot, determine whether the
lot satisfies the minimum lot size provision for such lot as set forth in this
Ordinance.
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 55
B. In an application for more than one dwelling unit on a single lot, calculate the
maximum number of such dwelling units that may be located on the lot in
accordance with the requirements set forth in this Ordinance. In all such
calculations, the result will be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
510 Building characteristics
510.1 Buildings in the RO district will have and maintain a residential scale and
appearance, in keeping with the objective for the district set forth in this Ordinance. The
number of dwelling units on each property as of May 11, 2004 may not be reduced as a
result of the introduction or expansion of office, professional office, restaurant, or retail
sales use on the property. Any dwelling units used to satisfy the requirements of this
section must contain at least two bedrooms if any portion of the lot lies within 100 feet of
the front property line along Lyme Road.
510.2 In order to promote architectural compatibility with nearby residential properties,
buildings located in whole or in part within 100 feet of the front property line along Lyme
Road in RO or GR districts must have individual building footprints of not more than
3,000 square feet, and buildings must be multi-story and include two or three habitable
floors.
510.3 Buildings located in whole or in part within 100 feet of the front property line
along Lyme Road in a B, RO, OL, or GR district must address any guidelines for Lyme
Road building characteristics contained in the Hanover Site Plan Regulations.
511 Obstruction of vision
On a corner lot in any zoning district, within the triangle formed by the two front lot lines
and a third, straight line joining points on the front lot lines 25 feet from their
intersection, there may be no obstruction to vision between the heights of three feet and
ten feet above the average grade of each street. By special exception, the Zoning Board of
Adjustment may waive this requirement in BM, B, D, OL, and I districts.
512 Screening of service areas and tanks
512.1 In any district all areas designated, used, or intended to be used as service areas for
any building or land use other than one-family and two-family dwelling units must be
screened from view with a wall or a solid fence or a fence and evergreens to a height of at
least five feet above grade level, on all sides of the service area facing a residential
district or land in residential use.
512.2 In the GR and SR districts, any above-ground fuel tank with a capacity of more
than 120 gallons must be screened from view from abutting properties.
513 Exterior lighting
Exterior lighting in conjunction with commercial, industrial, institutional, public, semipublic
uses, and residential accessory uses such as for swimming pools and tennis courts
must be installed and operated in such a way that provisions are made in directing the
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 56
lighting, screening, or other means in order to protect adjacent residential uses from
unreasonable illumination.
514 Noise standards
514.1 Noise beyond the limits set forth in this section are prohibited:
Districts
Maximum permissible A-weighted sound level
measured at the adjoining property line
By day: 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. By night: 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.
F, GP, GR, NP, RO, SR, RR 60 decibels 50 decibels
B, BM, D, I, OL 70 decibels 55 decibels
514.2 Measurement of Noise:
A. Noise level is measured with a sound meter that meets the standards of the
American Standards Institute and is set to the A-weighted response scale and the
meter to the slow response. Measurements must be conducted in accordance with
ANSI S 12.31 and S 12.32 American Standard Meter for the Physical
Measurement of Sound.
B. The slow meter response of the sound-level meter will be used in order to best
determine that the amplitude has not exceeded the limiting noise level set forth in
Section 514.1.
514.3 The following uses and activities are exempt from the provisions of this section:
A. Safety signals, warning devices, emergency relief valves, emergency generators,
and other emergency equipment when tested for functionality during initial
installation or in operation due to an emergency;
B. Unamplified human voices and crowd noises generated at gatherings open to the
public; and
C. Power tools, including lawn mowers, snow blowers and chain saws, when used
for the construction or maintenance of property.
514.4 Safety signals, warning devices, emergency relief valves, emergency generators,
and other emergency equipment may be tested for functionality after installation provided
such testing takes place during the day as established by this section and the noise
produced does not exceed the daytime decibel level established for the district in which
the equipment is located.
515 Temporary uses and structures
515.1 The Zoning Administrator may issue a temporary permit for a non-conforming use
incidental to a construction project, provided the owner agrees to remove the structure or
use upon expiration of the permit. A temporary permit is valid for a period not exceeding
one year and may be renewed upon application for an additional period of one year, to a
maximum of three years, as long as construction is active.
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 57
515.2 Temporary structures and uses incidental to construction projects that have
received site plan approval are considered permitted accessory uses on the site and do not
require a temporary permit for the period of construction, provided that the extent and
location of fencing and the general layout of temporary structures and uses have been
shown on a separate sheet of the site plan approved by the Planning Board. Such
incidental structures and uses include but are not limited to: construction fencing;
construction safety and directional signs; other construction and project signs;
construction trailers, vehicles, and equipment; portable toilets and lavatories; and lumber,
metal, drywall, cement, fittings, forms and other construction materials.
515.3 The Zoning Administrator may issue a temporary permit, for a period not
exceeding 18 months, to allow the use of a temporary access structure such as a handicap
ramp to enable a disabled individual to more easily and safely enter and exit a residence.
A temporary permit for disabled access is terminated when the disabled individual no
longer has need to enter and exit the residence or when the owner is granted a variance to
accommodate disabilities by the Zoning Board of Adjustment. A temporary access
structure requires the issuance of a building permit and must meet all building code
regulations.
516 Abandonment of structures
516.1 Within six months after work on an excavation for a structure has begun, any
remaining excavation must be covered by approved construction or filled to normal grade
by the owner.
516.2 Within six months after a permanent or temporary structure has been destroyed,
demolished, or abandoned, all structural materials must be removed from the site, and the
excavation thus remaining must be covered over by approved construction or filled to the
normal grade by the owner.
516.3 No structure in process of completion or demolition and no ruins from fire or
similar destructive cause may be abandoned in a disorderly or hazardous state. Such
structure will be considered to have been abandoned when:
A. Initiated work has been discontinued with the owner’s consent for 30 or more
consecutive days or for more than 30 days out of 60 days, or
B. Work to remedy the improper condition has not been initiated within 90 days after
the destructive event.
516.4 Abandoned excavations with slopes exceeding one horizontal to two vertical must
be protected by a fence at least four feet in height.
517 Removal of natural material
517.1 In any district, the removal of soil, sand, gravel, or ledge for sale, except when
incidental to construction of a building on the same lot, is permitted only when a plan for
the rehabilitation of the site has been approved as a special exception by the Zoning
Board of Adjustment, which may attach such additional conditions to its approval as it
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 58
may find necessary for the safety and general welfare of the public. The following
provisions apply:
A. Before approval of any new or extension to a sand or gravel operation, the Zoning
Board of Adjustment shall require the owner to file a performance bond with
sufficient security satisfactory to the Town Manager, in an amount equivalent to
ensure that upon completion of the extraction operation the site will be left in a
safe, attractive, and useful condition. The owner shall submit a plan of proposed
restoration to accomplish this end. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may waive
the bond except in an amount equivalent to 25 percent of the full cost of the
required restoration, only after the owner has presented financial statements and
other information deemed necessary by the Zoning Board of Adjustment to
determine the ability of the owner to satisfactorily comply with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The full cost of the restoration will be in an amount determined by
the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The bond will be approved as to form by town
legal counsel. The condition of the bond will be to guarantee the satisfactory
completion of the restoration plan approved by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
B. The removal of all material will be conducted so as not to result in damage to the
land, giving due regard to the contours in the vicinity, such as leveling slopes and
removing hills. The digging or creating of pits or steep slopes, except for exposed
ledge, is not permitted, unless provision is made to refill any such pit.
C. The excavation operation sites will be graded smooth and left in a neat condition.
Except for exposed ledge, unvegetative cut slopes and spoil banks may not
remain. The operation site must be fertilized, mulched, and reseeded so as to
establish a firm cover of grass or other vegetation sufficient to prevent erosion
under the supervision and to the satisfaction of the Town Manager.
D. All surface drainage affected by excavation operations will be controlled by the
owner to prevent erosion debris and other loose materials from filling any
drainage course, street, or private property. All provisions to control natural
drainage water must be approved by the Town Manager.
E. No excavation or blasting may take place within 200 feet of any street or other
property line.
517.2 No power-activated sorting machinery or equipment may be located within 300
feet of any street or other property line, and all such machinery must be equipped with
satisfactory dust elimination devices.
517.3 All excavation slopes in excess of one horizontal to one vertical must be
adequately fenced as determined by the Town Manager.
517.4 Extension of an existing non-conforming operation is not permitted.
517.5 Stripping of topsoil for sale or for use on other lots, except as may be incidental to
a construction project, is prohibited.
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 59
518 Storage of natural material
518.1 The temporary storage of any type of earth material, topsoil, gravel, rock, or other
debris for filling or deposition except for landscaping and/or in association with
construction and property maintenance, requires approval by the Zoning Board of
Adjustment as special exception if:
A. An amount greater than 15 cubic yards is stored on a lot in a GR or SR district in
any two year period,
B. An amount greater than 30 cubic yards is stored on a lot in the RR or F district in
any two year period, or
C. Except for projects subject to site plan or subdivision regulation, an amount
greater than 200 cubic yards is deposited on a lot in any district.
518.2 An applicant for special exception under this provision must present a plan
showing the final grades and topography of the property. The topography plan must show
existing and final grades with contour lines at intervals of not more than five feet. No
resulting final elevations will be more than five feet higher at the mutual property line
than any of the abutting properties and no resulting slopes on the property will be over
ten percent.
518.3 All filling, grading and seeding will be completed within six months of approval of
the special exception unless the Zoning Board of Adjustment specifically authorizes a
longer period of time.
519 Rentals
519.1 The owner of record of a property containing one or more rental units is solely
responsible for compliance with the provisions of this section.
519.2 A non-owner-occupied dwelling unit may be rented as a residence for an unrelated
family limited to three persons or a related family. No tenant may rent any space to
additional roomers.
519.3 Rooms without separate cooking facilities may be rented in any owner occupied
dwelling unit to not more than three non-transient persons. Rooms may not be rented in
non-owner-occupied dwelling units. Off-street parking adequate for occupants of the
rented rooms must be provided pursuant to Article X.
520 Affordable housing
520.1 A major subdivision, open space subdivision, multi-family residential
development, senior housing development or planned residential development may
include, as a density bonus, more than the number of lots or dwelling units allowed by
this Ordinance when a portion of those lots or units is permanently affordable.
A. The density bonus, or increase in the number of additional lots or dwelling units,
may not be greater than 20 percent of the number of lots or dwelling units
otherwise allowed by this Ordinance.
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 60
B. The word “lot” in this section includes any subsequent development of a lot so
that the lot and all fixed improvements on the lot comply with the applicable
affordability standards set forth below.
C. The calculation of the number of additional lots or units allowed is:
(1) For each two lots or units designated affordable at the 120 percent median
family income (MFI) level, the developer will be entitled to one additional
lot or unit with no affordability restrictions.
(2) For each lot or unit designated affordable at the 80 percent MFI level, the
developer will be entitled to one additional lot or unit with no affordability
restrictions.
(3) For each lot or unit designated affordable at the 50 percent MFI level, the
developer will be entitled to two additional lots or units with no affordability
restrictions.
(4) In cases where the above calculation results in a number of additional lots or
dwelling units that is a fraction, the number will be rounded down to the
nearest lesser integer.
D. The minimum area and frontage of each lot may be reduced from those areas and
lengths specified in this Ordinance in direct proportion, not to exceed 20 percent,
to the increase in the number of lots permitted in a major or open space
subdivision as allowed by this section.
E. All lot dimensional requirements for front, side, and rear setbacks and building
height and all parking space allowance requirements are as required by this
Ordinance.
F. An affordable senior housing development must comply with the design
requirements of the Architectural Barrier-free Design Code for the State of New
Hampshire, as amended, and must be licensed as may be required by appropriate
state agencies.
520.2 Sections 520.1 A and 604 notwithstanding, in the RO district, affordable senior
housing may be developed using a density bonus to increase the number of affordable
senior housing units and may have more than one principal building on a single lot. The
additional number of units may not be greater than 50 percent of the number of dwelling
units otherwise allowed by this Ordinance. A development using this density bonus must
reserve a minimum of 50 percent of their affordable units for low- and/or very-lowincome
households as defined by the USHUD.
520.3 Each lot or dwelling unit designated as affordable in the major subdivision, open
space subdivision, multi-family residential development, or planned residential
development must remain affordable in perpetuity.
A. There will be a limitation of the resale price of the affordable lot or unit, and, in
every transfer of the lot’s or unit’s ownership, a restriction of its resale to an
income eligible-buyer, by means of a deed covenant or other suitable method
specified in a legally enforceable document, applicable to the development and to
each affordable lot or dwelling unit found by the Planning Board with the advice
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 61
of the Hanover Affordable Housing Commission to be appropriate and effective
for ensuring such perpetual affordability. In approving such lots or dwelling units,
the Planning Board may specify that the applicant provide the means and methods
sufficient, in the Planning Board’s sole judgment, to guarantee continued
affordability throughout the duration of the development.
B. Such deed covenant or other legally enforceable document will specify that the
Town of Hanover has legal right on its own volition, or through its duly
designated agent, to monitor and ensure the continuing validity of such covenant
or document and to renew or cause renewal of such covenant or document for the
purpose of extending indefinitely and for as many times as necessary the
continuing affordability of lots or dwelling units as originally approved by the
Planning Board.
C. Notwithstanding the above, the Town of Hanover agrees to subordinate its deed
covenant or other legally enforceable document provided for in Section 520.3.A
and B above to any and all agreements and documents from USHUD, the New
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority or the US Department of Agriculture
Rural Development, so long as said entities’ agreements impose affordability
requirements that are reasonably similar in scope to those proposed by the Town
of Hanover.
520.4 For any developments claiming lots or additional units on the basis of affordability,
the Hanover Affordable Housing Commission will assess the proposed affordability
calculations and the proposed method of perpetual affordability conveyance and will
provide the results of this assessment to the Planning Board prior to the submission by
the developer to the Planning Board for approval of a development application.
520.5 The occupancy of an affordable rental lot or dwelling unit and the ownership and
occupancy of an affordable owner-occupied lot or dwelling unit will be restricted to those
households that, at the time of initial occupancy and/or ownership, are certified to meet
but not exceed the median family income level appropriate to the affordable lot’s or
unit’s income-level designation.
520.6 Because the density bonus is permitted for a development only as commensurate
with the provision of affordable lots or dwelling units in that development as specified
above, such lots or units will remain affordable for as long as the development remains
legally in existence.
521 Impact fees
521.1 The Planning Board may, as a condition of approval of any site plan or subdivision
and when consistent with applicable Hanover regulations, require an applicant to pay an
impact fee for the applicant’s fair share of off-site improvements to public facilities
affected by the development. Nothing in this section may be construed to limit the
authority of the Planning Board to:
A. Disapprove proposed development that is scattered and premature, would require
an excessive expenditure of public funds, or would otherwise violate applicable

the Planning Board has approved the final plat pursuant to statute and Hanover
Subdivision Regulations.
B. In the event of a conflict between a standard or requirement set forth in this article
and a standard or requirement set forth elsewhere in this Ordinance, the standard
or requirement set forth in this article shall govern.
902 Open space development
902.1 Open space development is intended to encourage environmentally sound
planning; to protect open space and natural resources and create attractive living
environments through creative placement of single family dwelling units; and to
discourage developmental sprawl and consumption of scenic, forested, agricultural, and
recreational land, thus maintaining the rural character of the Town of Hanover.
902.2 An open space subdivision is subject to the following minimum number of lots,
each of which must conform to the following minimum lot size and minimum setbacks in
the following zoning districts:
District Minimum
number of lots
Minimum
lot size
Minimum
front setback
Minimum
side and rear setbacks
RR 3 1.5 acres 35 feet 35 feet
SR 1 4 0.5 acre 25 feet 15 feet
SR 2 2 0.25 acre 20 feet 10 feet
Minimum road frontage of new lots must be 50 feet along proposed open space
subdivision roads except that the provisions of Section 503 apply to new lots fronting on
the turn-around portion of cul-de-sacs; Section 503 also applies to new lots fronting on
existing Town roads at the time the new open space subdivision plat is proposed.
902.3 An open space subdivision must conform to the following maximum density
requirements:
A. The maximum number of dwelling units in an open space subdivision may not
exceed, except as indicated in paragraph B of this section, that permitted under
the regular and ordinary provisions of the zoning district or districts containing
the proposed open space subdivision. Where the proposed subdivision is located
in two zoning districts, the maximum number of dwelling units is the sum of such
dwelling units allowed separately within each district on the condition that the
open space subdivision is an allowed use in both districts.
B. In recognition of the provision of attractive and useable open space for public use
as defined in Section 902.4, the Planning Board may in its discretion grant a
density bonus for an open space subdivision, which does not exceed a number
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 84
more than ten percent of the number of permitted lots in the respective zoning
district. The Planning Board may grant an additional bonus of one lot per
subdivision when a specific open space acceptable to the Planning Board is
deeded or otherwise dedicated for public use to the Town of Hanover or to a
governmental or non-profit agency acceptable to the Town.
902.4 An open space subdivision is subject to the following requirements.
A. A minimum of 35% of the area in the proposed subdivision shall be maintained
and dedicated as open space, conservation, recreation, agricultural, or forestry
land.

the Planning Board. In addition, the Planning Board may require that all or some
of the open space is protected by means such as by conveyance of the land or a
conservation easement to a government entity, conservation organization or
homeowner’s association approved by the Planning Board. If a conservation
easement is used to restrict development, it must prohibit activities that would
diminish the open space benefit or function.
D. In the RR district, each lot must be so designed that a square each side of which is
150 feet in length can be placed somewhere within the lot lines of each proposed
lot. In the SR-1 and SR-2 districts, each lot must be so designed that a square each
side of which is 75 feet in length can be placed somewhere within the lot lines of
each proposed lot.
E. In the RR district, individual on-site septic systems and water supplies are
permitted in open space subdivisions subject to all applicable and required town,
state, and federal approvals. At the discretion of the Planning Board and subject to
all applicable state and federal approvals, community utility systems may be
permitted. Such community disposal systems must be located outside of
designated open space areas. In the SR-1 and SR-2 districts, all lots must be
connected to the municipal water and sewer systems.
903 Planned residential development
903.1 The objectives of a planned residential development (PRD) subdivision are to
encourage flexibility of design and development; to allow a more useful and flexible
pattern of housing types that may include multi-family dwellings; to allow for the
economic advantage of smaller networks of streets and utilities; and to encourage the
preservation and recreational use of open space in harmony with the natural terrain,
scenic qualities, and outstanding features of the land.
903.2 A PRD must conform to the following area and setback requirements:
A. A PRD is subject to the following minimum area and minimum setbacks in the
following zoning districts.

GR-3 20 acres 20 feet 20 feet
GR-4 20 acres 25 feet 20 feet
B. Within a PRD there are no fixed setback requirements for zoning purposes. The
distances between buildings and distances between buildings and streets within
the PRD are governed by Hanover Subdivision Regulations. In addition, in a PRD
in the GR-3 and GR-4 districts, area and dimensional requirements from Table
405.7 do not apply and there are no:
(1) minimum required area per additional family,
(2) minimum setbacks,
(3) maximum building footprint, or
(4) maximum lot coverage other than as set forth in 902.3 B or as follows:
a. The minimum lot size is 5000 square feet in the GR-3 district and 2700
square feet in the GR-4 district,

footprint area of buildings within a PRD in the GR-4 district may exceed
35 feet in height. A building exceeding 35 feet in height must be set back
not less than 300 feet from the property line common to a public right of
way and the lot lines of properties located in the SR or GR districts, as
such lot lines exist at the time of filing of the initial PRD application.
903.3 The maximum number of dwelling units may not exceed the following:
District One unit
for the first
One additional unit
for the next
One additional unit
for each additional
OL 10,000 sq. ft. 5,000 sq. ft. 5,000 sq. ft.

GR-3 one half acre one half acre one half acre
GR-4 5,000 sq. ft. 5,000 sq. ft. 5,000 sq. ft.
Where a proposed PRD is located in more than one zoning district, only that land that lies
within a zoning district in which a PRD is permitted may be used to calculate the
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 86
maximum number of dwelling units that could be developed in that PRD, and all
buildings in that PRD must be located in a zoning district in which a PRD is permitted.
Section 507, governing lots in more than one zoning district, is not applicable in
developments where this provision is employed.
903.4 A PRD is subject to the following requirements:
A. All dwelling units must be connected to the municipal sewer system and the
Town’s central water system.
B. Two or more buildings are required. No building in the OL and GR districts may
contain more than 15 dwelling units
C. In the GR-4 district, a minimum of two different building types is required for
developments ranging in size from two acres to five acres, a minimum of three
different building types is required for developments from five acres to ten acres,
and a minimum of four different building types is required for developments
exceeding ten acres. For the purpose of this section, building type is defined by
the combination of:
(1) The number of bedrooms in the building,
(2) The number of units in the building, and
(3) The building square footage rounded to the nearest 500 square feet.
D. A minimum of 45 percent of the area of the PRD in the GR-3 district, 30 percent
of the area of the PRD in the GR-4 district, and 65 percent of the area of the PRD
in all other districts must be retained for open space and outdoor recreational
areas. For the purposes of this paragraph, if the proposed PRD is located on a lot
in more than one zoning district, “area of the PRD” means only that land which
lies within a zoning district in which a PRD is permitted. For a PRD in the GR-4
district, up to 40 percent of the open space and outdoor recreational area
requirement may be satisfied by dedication of an area on a portion of the lot in the
NP district and/or an off-site area in any district including the NP district,
provided that any off-site area abuts the PRD.
E. Open space must be protected from development unless otherwise permitted by
the Planning Board. In addition, the Planning Board may require that all or some
of the open space is protected by means such as by conveyance of the land or a

1002.2 The Zoning Administrator shall determine the applicable use category to
determine the minimum number of off-street parking spaces required for each building or
use.
A. For a building or use that falls into more than one of the categories listed in
Section 1002.1, the Zoning Administrator shall determine a reasonable and
appropriate minimum number of off-street parking spaces required for each
individual component of the building or use, the sum of which is the minimum
number of required off-street parking spaces for the building or use.
B. For a building or use that does not fall within any of the categories listed in
Section 1002.1, the Zoning Administrator shall determine reasonable and
appropriate minimum off-street parking requirements by applying the closest
applicable categories of Section 1002.1.
1002.3 The Zoning Administrator’s administrative determination of applicable use
category may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Adjustment, which shall consider all
factors entering into the parking needs of each such building or use.
1003 Special exception for shared use of parking spaces
1003.1 The Zoning Board of Adjustment may approve as a special exception the shared
use of one or more parking spaces by two or more establishments or uses on the same lot
or on contiguous lots, the total capacity of which is less than the sum of the off-street
parking spaces required for each, provided the Zoning Board of Adjustment finds that the
number of off-street parking spaces to be provided will substantially meet the intent of
the requirements for reason of variation in the probable time of maximum use by patrons
of the establishments or uses.
1003.2 Any approval of a special exception for the shared use of off-street parking spaces
must include the following conditions:
A. The approved special exception will automatically terminate upon the termination
of any establishment or use participating in the shared use and
B. The approved special exception will automatically terminate upon any substantial
change in the time pattern in the use of the shared spaces by any participant
establishment or use that results in a number of off-street parking spaces
insufficient for the combined requirements of the establishments or users.
1004 Location of off-street parking spaces
1004.1 Required off-street parking spaces must be provided on the lot occupied by the
building or use they serve, except as follows:
A. Parking spaces required for a building or use on two abutting lots may be
provided in a single common parking facility on one or both of the adjoining lots.
B. Parking spaces required for any residence in the I district intended for students,
fraternal housing, or institutional personnel may be provided off the lot occupied
by the building served, except that handicapped parking and parking for short
term transient use must be provided in reasonable proximity to the residence. The
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 94
number of handicapped spaces to be provided is calculated based on the
Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 USC 12101, et. seq. An equal number of
short-term spaces must be provided for short term transient parking.
C. For a building or use other than a residence in the I district intended for students,
fraternal housing, or institutional personnel and other than a building or use
located in a D district, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may allow as a special
exception the location of all or part of the required off-street parking spaces
elsewhere than on the lot occupied by the building served, provided the Zoning
Board of Adjustment finds that:
(1) Such off-lot space will satisfy the parking requirement by control or
regulation of the land owners and
(2) Each proposed off-street parking space is adequate in location and access to
satisfy the off-street parking requirements for the building or use it serves.
1004.2 The provision of off-lot, off-street parking spaces is allowed only for all uses in
the I district, residential uses in the D districts, and non-residential uses in all other
districts. Notwithstanding 1004.1, all required off-street parking spaces not located in a
parking facility may be located only in a zoning district in which the use served by those
spaces is a permitted use. Such spaces may be allowed by special exception in a zoning
district in which the use being served is allowed by special exception.
1004.3 A parking space on a lot in the D or I districts that is accessory to the principal
structure or use on that lot may be leased to or otherwise made available for occupants of
and visitors to other properties in those districts.
1004.4 Off-street parking is permitted within required side and rear setbacks.
1004.5 Off-street parking is permitted in required front setbacks only in driveways.
Portions of driveways within the required front setback do not satisfy parking
requirements set forth in the schedule of minimum requirements for off-street parking. In
the RO district, off-street parking is not permitted in the area between the front of the
principal building and the street right-of-way, an area including but not limited to the
required front setback, except that parking in a driveway is permitted.
1004.6 The outdoor parking of not more than one automobile maintained primarily for
hire, a commercial truck not exceeding one ton capacity, or other commercial vehicle is
permitted only in the side or rear yard of any residential lot, where it must be located
farther from the street than the nearest portion of any building to the street. No such
vehicle may be parked if it exceeds ten feet in height above the ground, except that masts,
antennae, or other minor accessories may exceed this height limit.
1004.7 The outdoor parking or storage of major recreational equipment including travel
trailers, pick-up coaches, camper trailers, motor homes, boats and boat trailers,
snowmobiles; combinations thereof and other similar equipment and cases and boxes
used for transporting recreational equipment, whether occupied by such equipment or
not, is allowed as an accessory use only in the side or rear yard of any lot and only where
it is located farther from the street than the nearest portion of any building to the street.
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 95
A. No such recreational equipment may be parked or stored if it exceeds ten feet in
height above the ground, except that masts, antennae, vent stacks, windshields or
other minor accessories may exceed this height limit.
B. No such recreational equipment may be used in such location for living, sleeping,
housekeeping or business purposes.
C. If otherwise lawful, parking is permitted anywhere on the premises or on an
adjacent street for a period not to exceed 24 hours during loading or unloading.
1005 Improvement and maintenance of parking facilities
1005.1 A required off-street parking space may be enclosed in a structure or may be
open, provided that each required parking space is graded, surfaced, drained, and suitably
maintained for parking purposes to the extent necessary to avoid nuisance of dust,
erosion, or excessive water flow across public ways and to ensure its reasonable
availability for use. In appropriate situations, the Zoning Administrator may require
suitable markings to indicate individual parking spaces, maneuvering areas, entrances,
and exits. Upon application duly made, the Zoning Administrator may waive the
requirement of maintaining for parking purposes any off-street parking space for an
appropriate period of time during which the Zoning Administrator finds that use of the
space will be suspended because of an interruption of the use or occupancy of the
premises that the space is intended to serve.
1005.2 Each required parking space must be not less than eight feet wide nor less than 18
feet long, exclusive of aisles, drives, and maneuvering space.
1005.3 A required off-street parking space must be maintained as long as the use or
structure exists which the space is designed to serve. Nothing hereunder may be
construed to constitute or contemplate a dedication of required off-street parking spaces
to general public use, but any such spaces, required in conjunction with particular
buildings and uses, may be reserved at all times for those persons who make use of such
buildings and uses, except when such parking spaces are acquired by the Town by
donation or purchase as public parking areas.
1006 Parking credits
1006.1 Within a D district, parking requirements are satisfied by the requisite number of
parking assets, which may include parking credits in addition to parking spaces, both onor
off-site. One parking credit is the equivalent of one parking space. At any time after
March 2, 1976, the total parking assets associated with a property must equal or exceed
the requirements for that property as set forth in the schedule of minimum requirements
for off-street parking spaces.
1006.2 Parking credits are conveyed with the property occupied by the building or use
they serve and may not be sold, leased, otherwise transferred, or used to satisfy the
zoning requirements of another property.
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 96
1006.3 Parking credits may be awarded in accordance with 1006.4 or by conversion of
off-site spaces to parking credits in accordance with 1006.5. Alternatively, the Town of
Hanover may allow parking credits to be purchased to satisfy parking requirements.
1006.4 As of May 14, 2002, for properties located in a D district, the Town shall prepare
a tabulation to establish a baseline set of parking requirements and parking assets
associated with each property in accordance with the following steps:
A. Parking requirements are calculated based on the schedule of minimum
requirements for off-street parking spaces;
B. The number and location of physical on-site parking spaces are verified;
C. Sufficient parking credits are awarded, at no cost to the property owner, such that
the total of physical parking assets plus total parking credits equals requirements;
and
D. A permanent public record is created for each property documenting the parking
assets for that property. The record must include the current parking requirements
set forth in the schedule of minimum off-street parking spaces, the current number
of physical on-site parking spaces, and the total number of parking credits.
1006.5 If parking credits are being provided via conversion of off-site physical parking
spaces into parking credits, the Town shall provide the applicant with appropriate
documentation after having received:
A. Appropriate plans or documentation confirming the existence and location of the
off-site spaces and demonstrating that each such off-site space is located in a D
district and is adequate in location and access (the distance between the lots at
their closest point is a maximum of 750 feet lot line to lot line) to address the
parking requirements for such building or use.
B. Formal written concurrence by the owner of the property on which the off-site
spaces are located that the owner agrees to the conversion and acknowledges that
the total number of parking credits associated with his property will be reduced by
one for each physical space so converted. If this results in a negative number of
parking credits the number will be so recorded.
C. An accounting of the parking requirements and parking assets for the property on
which the off-site spaces are located that demonstrates that the total revised
parking assets (arithmetic sum of on-site spaces plus parking credits) equals or
exceeds the parking requirements as set forth in the schedule of minimum
requirements for off-street parking.
1006.6 As of the effective date of the awarding of parking credits in accordance with
1006.4 C, all properties in the D districts will be deemed to be in full compliance with the
parking requirements of this Ordinance.
1007 Parking and transportation demand management plan option
An applicant or group of applicants proposing to use property or properties located in the
BM, B, OL, or I district may satisfy the parking requirements of this Ordinance relating
to its buildings and uses by preparing and implementing a parking and transportation
demand management (PTDM) plan in accordance with Hanover Site Plan Regulations.

intended to be treated as intermittent streams hereunder.
lowest floor
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including basement. An unfinished or flood
resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an
area other than a basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor, provided that
such an enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable
non-elevation design requirements of this Ordinance.
manufactured home and manufactured housing
A structure, transportable in one or more sections, that is built on a permanent chassis and
is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the
required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the terms “manufactured home”
and “manufactured housing” include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar
vehicles placed on site for greater than 180 consecutive days. This includes manufactured
homes located in a manufactured home park or subdivision.
manufactured home park or subdivision
A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home
lots for rent or sale
mean sea level
The National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced

new construction
For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the “start of
construction” commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after
December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures. For floodplain management purposes, “new construction” means
structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of
a floodplain management regulation adopted by Hanover and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
special flood hazard area - see area of special flood hazard
substantial damage
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure
to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of
the structure before the damage occurred
substantial improvement
Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure in
which the cumulate cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure.
The market value of the structure should equal (1) the appraised value prior to the start of
the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure
prior to the damage occurring. For the purposes of this definition, “substantial
improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor,
or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the structure. “Substantial improvement” includes structures
that have incurred substantial damage, regardless of actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure required to
comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions or any alteration of a historic structure,
provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
vernal pool
A surface water or wetland, excluding areas resulting from man-made activities such as
gravel pit operations, logging equipment rutting, sedimentation ponds, or detention
ponds, but including area intentionally created for purposes of compensatory mitigation
which provides breeding habitat for amphibians and invertebrates that have adapted to the
unique environments provided by these pools and which cycle annually from flooded to
dry conditions although their hydroperiod, size and shape might vary from year to year.
Typically, “vernal pools” are formed in a shallow depression or basin, have no
permanently flowing outlet, hold water for at least two continuous months following
spring ice-out, lack a viable fish population, and support one or more primary “vernal
pool” indicators or three or more secondary “vernal pool” indicators as defined by the
New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services.

violation
Failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s
flood plain management regulations. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44
CFR s 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
water resources
Waterbodies, wetlands including vernal pools, and intermittent streams
water resource buffer
The buffer area of a water resource is the area within 75 horizontal feet of the top of the
bank of any waterbody or within 75 horizontal feet of any wetland. In the case of a
sewage disposal system the buffer is the area within 125 horizontal feet of a bank of any
waterbody, the edge of any wetland, or an intermittent stream.
water surface elevation
The height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929, (or other datum,
where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplain
waterbody
Any river, stream, brook, lake or pond containing surface water throughout the year, and
includes all area up to the top of the bank of the waterbody. The bank of a waterbody is
the transitional slope immediately adjacent to the edge of the surface water, usually
characterized by a break in slope at both the top and the bottom.
watercourse
A natural or manmade channel through which water may flow
wetland
Any area that is inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and
duration to support, and that under normal conditions does support, a prevalence of
vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands include but are
not limited to swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. Wetlands are delineated on the
basis of hydrophytic vegetation, hydric soils, and wetlands hydrology in accordance with
the techniques outlined in the Corps of Engineers “Wetlands Delineation Manual,
Technical Report Y-87-1” (January 1987); provided, however, that delineations based on
hydrophytic vegetation or hydric soils are sufficient for projects allowed by
administrative permit under Section 1103.7, so long as the vegetation or soil has not been
disrupted by artificial planting or past dredging or filling. Wetlands classifications, when
made, are in accordance with U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Manual FWS/OBS-79/31,
“Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States” (Cowardin et
al, 1979).

1102 Flood plain protection
1102.1 There is hereby established the Flood Plain district in order to:
A. Comply with the regulations for the federal government for qualification for flood
damage insurance, and
B. Encourage only that type of development of flood-prone areas that:
(1) Is appropriate in the light of the probability of flood damage and the need to
replace flood losses to the public and to individuals,
(2) Represents an acceptable social and economic use of the land in relation to
the hazards involved, and
(3) Does not increase danger to human life, and
C. Discourage all other development of flood-prone areas.
1102.2 The Flood Plain district is shown on maps described in Section 1102 above as
FBFM and FIRM, but limited only to the A and AE zones shown on the FIRM map. The
interpretation of the maps is that indicated in the New Hampshire Flood Management
Handbook, as updated by the New Hampshire Office of Energy and Planning. Areas
adjacent to the mapped flood plain whose elevations are indicated as being below the
100-year flood zone, but not shown on the map itself as being in the flood plain, may
nonetheless be part of the Flood Plain district. Such Flood Plain districts are
superimposed over any other zoning established in this Ordinance.
1102.3 There is hereby prohibited any fill, new construction, substantial improvement
and any other development within the 100 year floodplain, except as provided for in
Sections 1102.5 and 1102.6.
1102.4 No manufactured housing may be placed or replaced within the Floodway. Any
replacement of manufactured housing outside of the Floodway is subject to the following
requirements:
A. All manufactured housing must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement by providing over the top and frame ties to ground anchors. Specific
requirements are:
(1) Over-the-top ties provided at each of the four corners of the manufactured
housing, with two additional ties per side at intermediate locations and
manufactured housing less than 50 feet long requiring one additional tie per
side;
(2) Frame ties provided at each corner of the housing with five additional ties per
side at intermediate points and manufactured housing less than 50 feet long
requiring four additional ties per side;
(3) All components of the anchoring system must be capable of carrying a force
of 4,800 pounds; and
(4) Any additions to the manufactured housing must be similarly anchored.
B. The following additional requirements also apply where elevations are provided
on the FIRM (Elevations are shown on the FIRM in Zone AE) and where
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 104
elevations are not provided on the FIRM (Elevations are not shown on the FIRM
in Zone A):
(1) No dwelling unit, including a manufactured home, may be placed within a
special flood hazard area.
(2) All manufactured homes to be substantially improved within special flood
hazard areas must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood level. In
addition, adequate surface drainage and access for a hauler must be provided
and in the instance of elevation on pilings, the lot must be large enough to
permit steps, piling foundations must be placed in stable soil no more than
ten feet apart and reinforcement must be provided for piers more than six feet
above the ground level.
1102.5 The following uses are permitted within the Flood Plain district to the extent that
such uses are not prohibited by any other ordinance and provided that building, fill, or
storage of equipment is not required:
A. Agricultural uses,
B. Forestry uses, and
C. Outdoor recreation uses.
D. Accessory uses to A, B, and C above.
No new buildings or substantial improvements of structures are permitted in the Flood
Plain district unless such a prohibition would preclude reasonable use of the lot as
determined by the underlying zoning district in which it is located. To reach such a
conclusion, the Zoning Board of Adjustment must find that the conditions for a variance
are met. An applicant for such a variance must also meet the applicable standards for
granting special exceptions set out in Section 1102.7 below. Fill in the floodplain is
permitted for this purpose subject to the conditions of 209 D, the minimum variance that
will afford reasonable relief.
1102.6 The following uses are allowed within the Flood Plain district by special
exception:
A. Railroads, streets, bridges and essential services;
B. Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves;
C. Outdoor storage; and
D. Off-street parking space or parking facility.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1102.6 B, a seasonal dock that may be
permitted as a minimum impact expedited project by the Wetlands Bureau of the State of
New Hampshire and as permitted under Section 1103.5 A is permitted and does not
require a special exception.
1102.7 For any proposal for which subdivision or site plan approval by the Planning
Board is required, no application for special exception will be accepted until preliminary
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 105
subdivision or site plan review has been completed; the application for special exception
must reflect the Planning Board’s resulting recommendations.
A. In acting upon special exception applications, the Zoning Board of Adjustment
shall find that the proposed use complies with all other applicable sections of this
Ordinance, with all other applicable town, state and federal regulations and laws
and further that such proposed use will not:
(1) Create danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities
caused by encroachments or
(2) Create danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream to
the injury of others.
B. The Board shall also find:
(1) That the proposed water supply and sanitation systems are sufficient and
adequate to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions and
comply with applicable town and state regulations and laws and are so
constructed as to prevent the entrance of flood waters;
(2) Depending upon use, that the proposed use requires a waterfront location;
(3) That alternative locations not subject to flooding are unavailable for the
proposed use;
(4) That the proposed use is compatible with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future as indicated in the Town
Master Plan, considering the relationship of the proposed use to the Flood
Plain Management Program in effect, if any, for the area;
(5) That access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles is safe and not hazardous;
(6) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures
have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base
flood level;
(7) All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the
base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities so
designed that below the base flood level the structure is flood proofed,
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
(8) Where flood proofing is utilized for a particular structure in accordance with
the standards as contained herein, a registered professional engineer or
architect certifies that the flood proofing methods are adequate to withstand
the flood depths, pressures, velocity, impact and uplift forces and other
factors associated with the base flood, and a record of such certificates
indicating the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such
structures are flood proof is maintained by the Zoning Administrator.
(9) Flood proofing consists of the following, as needed:
a. Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads, and shutters;
b. Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressures;
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 106
c. Use of paints, membranes, or mortars to reduce seepage of water through
walls;
d. Addition of weight to building to resist flotation;
e. Installation of pumps to lower water levels in building;
f. Pumping facilities for subsurface external foundation wall and basement
floor pressures;
g. Construction to resist rupture or collapse caused by water pressure or
floating debris;
h. Cutoff valves on sewer lines or the elimination of gravity flow basement
drains;
i. Installation above base flood elevations of all water heaters, furnaces,
electrical distribution panels, and other critical mechanical or electrical
installations, with separate electrical circuits dropped from above to serve
basements; and
j. Venting tanks above base flood elevations.
(10) Water supply systems, sanitary sewage systems, and on-site waste disposal
systems, as follows:
a. New and replacement water supply systems must be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems.
b. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems (centralized systems and
treatment facilities) must be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharge from systems
into the flood waters.
c. On-site waste disposal systems (including individual septic tanks and
leach fields) must be located so far as practicable to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding.
(11) Anchorage to prevent flotation and lateral movement.
(12) The applicant shall demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increases in flood levels
within the community during the base flood discharge.
1102.8 Existing non-conforming structures and buildings and non-conforming uses are
allowed to continue. Any such structure or building may be enlarged or extended as a
special exception in conformity with the standards set forth in Section 1102.7 above.
1102.9 Recreational vehicles placed on sites within Flood Zones A and AE must either:
A. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and
B. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
C. Meet all standards of Section 60.3 (b)(1) of the National Flood Insurance Program
Regulations and the elevation and anchoring requirements for “manufactured
homes” in Section 60.3(c)(6).
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE

1102.10 Permits are subject to the following provisions:
A. A permit must be obtained for the use and/or development of any land in the
Flood Plain district. No permit issued hereunder is valid unless all necessary
permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which
approval is required by federal or state law including Section 404 of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act and Amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334. The
applicant shall satisfy the Zoning Administrator of such compliance prior to the
issuance of a permit.
B. All permit applications hereunder must be reviewed to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed
building site is in the Flood Plain district, all new construction and substantial
improvements (including the placement of prefabricated buildings and
manufactured housing) must be:
(1) Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement of the structure;
(2) Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
(3) Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; and
(4) Constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning,
and other service or utility facilities that are designed and/or located so as to
prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.
C. In riverine situations, prior to issuing any permit for development that would alter
or relocate any watercourse within the Flood Plain district, the applicant for such
authorization shall notify the Wetlands Bureau of the New Hampshire Department
of Environmental Services and submit copies of such notification to the Zoning
Administrator, in addition to the copies required by RSA 482-A:3. Further, the
applicant shall be required to submit copies of said notification to those adjacent
communities as determined by the Zoning Administrator, including notice of all
scheduled hearings before the Wetlands Bureau. It must be a condition of any
such permit that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion
of any watercourse is maintained. The applicant shall submit to the Zoning
Administrator, certification provided by a registered engineer, assuring that the
carrying capacity of the altered or relocated watercourse(s) can and will be
maintained.
D. As to the areas of the Flood Plain district shown as Zone A for which specific
elevations are not yet available, the Zoning Administrator shall obtain, review,
and reasonably utilize any Base Flood elevation data available from a federal,
state or other source as criteria for requiring that all new construction and
substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated to or above base flood level and all new construction and
substantial improvements of non-residential structures have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated or flood proofed to or above the base flood level.
E. Elevations must be furnished by applicant. The applicant shall provide to the
Zoning Administrator and the Zoning Administrator shall maintain a record of the
elevation of:
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 108
(1) The lowest habitable floor including basement of all new or substantially
improved structures whether or not such structures contain a basement, or
(2) If the structure has been flood proofed, the elevation to which the structure
has been flood proofed.
F. The property owner or applicant shall present a plan, certified by a professional
engineer licensed in New Hampshire, that clearly delineates the 100 year flood
elevation.
G. The 100 year flood elevation determination is used as criteria for requiring that:
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures
have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the 100 year
flood level;
(2) All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the
100 year flood level or be flood-proofed and certified by a professional
engineer.
H. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain for public inspection, and furnish upon
request, any certification of flood-proofing and the as built elevation of the lowest
floor (including the basement) of all new or substantially improved structures and
include whether or not such structure contains a basement. The Zoning
Administrator shall also maintain records as to whether the structure has been
flood-proofed, and the elevation to which the structure is flood-proof. This
information must be furnished by all applicants for a permit.
I. Until a regulatory floodway is designated along watercourses, no new
construction, substantial improvements or other development (including fill) may
be permitted within Zones AE on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated by the
applicant that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined
with all existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.
J. For all new construction and substantial improvements, fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are permitted provided they
meet the following requirements:
(1) The enclosed area is unfinished or flood resistant, usable solely for the
parking of vehicles, building access or storage;
(2) The area is not a basement;
(3) The area is designed to automatically equal hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater.
K. Designs for meeting the requirement set forth in J above must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
(1) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding must be
provided;
(2) The bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above grade; and
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 109
(3) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or
devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood water.
L. The Building Inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any floodway
data available from federal, state, or other sources as criteria for requiring that all
development located in Zone A meet the following floodway requirement: no
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and
other development are allowed within the floodway that would result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the base flood discharge.
1102.11 Land located in a Flood Plain district may be used only in accordance with the
provisions of Section 1102 regardless of the uses permitted or allowed in the underlying
zoning district.
1102.12 The degree of flood protection required by this Ordinance is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of
study. Larger floods may occur, floods may occur in other stream beds, or flood heights
may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This Ordinance does not imply that any area outside the Flood Plain
district boundaries or land uses permitted within such district will be free from flooding
or flood damages. This Ordinance does not create liability on the part of the Town of
Hanover or any officer thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
1103 Wetland, waterbody, and intermittent stream protection
1103.1 The provisions of this Section 1103 are adopted pursuant to the authority
contained in RSA 674:16-17 in the interest of public health, safety, and general welfare
of the residents of the Town of Hanover.
A. The purpose of these provisions is to regulate activities in water resources and
their buffers as defined in this section. Such provisions are intended to serve to
mitigate contamination or pollution of surface and ground water; maintain ground
water recharge; sustain storm water storage; protect wildlife habitats; preserve
wetlands; and maintain the ecological and aesthetic values associated with water
resources and their buffers in the Town of Hanover.
B. This section should be administered balancing the foregoing objectives with the
public interest in protecting historic resources, scenic views, and agricultural
soils.
C. An additional purpose of this section is to reduce regulatory burdens on applicants
by conforming, where consistent with the substantive requirements of the
Ordinance, the regulatory and procedural requirements of the Ordinance to those
imposed by the dredge and fill regulations adopted by the Division of Water
Resources of the Department of Environmental Services of the State of New
Hampshire. This is not always possible. For example, the State of New
Hampshire dredge and fill regulations, unlike this Ordinance, do not regulate
activity beyond the shoreline in water resource buffers. Moreover, some permit
approval criteria are unique to the Hanover Ordinance.
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 110
1103.2 The following general restrictions apply:
A. In order to achieve the foregoing purposes, no person may engage in activity, as
defined in Section 1101, within a waterbody or wetland, vernal pool, or
intermittent stream or in the buffer area around those features as defined in Article
XI, unless explicitly permitted pursuant to this section. In this section, the term
water resource refers to waterbodies, wetlands, vernal pools and intermittent
streams, all as defined in this Ordinance, and the term water resource buffer refers
to the buffer area described in the foregoing sentence.
B. The following activities are prohibited within a waterbody or wetland, vernal
pool, or intermittent stream or in the buffer area around those features as defined
in Section 1101: salt storage, auto junkyards, solid or hazardous waste facilities,
bulk chemical storage, or the use of chemical lawn fertilizers.
C. No person may place a leach field or any part thereof within 125 feet of any water
resource unless a special exception has been allowed pursuant to Section 1103.7
1103.3 Persons proposing to engage in activities are responsible for identifying the water
resources and associated buffers that are subject to the restrictions set forth herein.
General locations of some but not all water resources are shown on the map entitled
“Water Resources” maintained by the Hanover Planning and Zoning Department. The
precise delineation of water resources and their buffers will be based upon the definitions
set forth in Section 1101, not upon that map.
1103.4 The following activities, if otherwise prohibited by Section 1103.2, are permitted.
The itemized activities are not intended to permit evasion of restrictions by piecemeal
activity. None of these activities may occur in any vernal pool or its buffer.
A. Activity that disturbs, in the aggregate, less than 100 square feet in a wetland,
waterbody or intermittent stream, 500 square feet in the associated 25 foot buffer
and 1500 square feet in the associated 25 foot to 75 foot buffer, and that does not
increase drainage into the wetland, waterbody or intermittent stream during or
after construction. Disturbance caused by silt fence installation before or during
construction is permitted and is not included in the calculation of permitted
disturbance.
B. An activity within a wetland or intermittent stream or a buffer of a wetland in
cases in which the wetland or intermittent stream comprises, in the aggregate, less
than 1000 square feet. This permission does not exempt activities from review to
the extent they may adversely affect the functioning of any other water resource.
C. A project that involves no increase in lot coverage and no alteration of terrain but
results solely in a change in building mass or volume.
1103.5 The following activities, if otherwise prohibited by Section 1103.2, are permitted
upon notification to the Zoning Administrator and notice to the Hanover Conservation
Commission as contemplated by Subsection D of this section. The following itemized
activities are not intended to permit evasion of restrictions by piecemeal activity.
A. Activities within the jurisdiction of the Division of Water Resources of New
Hampshire Department of Environmental Services for which a Permit by
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 111
Notification or a Minimum Impact Expedited Application as authorized by that
department is properly filed and sufficient in accordance with the regulations and
procedures of that department. The effect of such regulations is to require that an
application for such a permit for activity in Hanover be consented to by the
Hanover Conservation Commission. New Hampshire permits subject to this
section do not apply to activity in buffers. See Section 1103.6 A for required
standards for activity in a buffer associated with activity for which a permit by
notification or a minimum impact expedited permit has been obtained.
B. Repair or reconstruction of an existing legal structure authorized by and meeting
the conditions of New Hampshire Department of Environmental Resources
Regulation Env-Wt 303.05 (a) as it may be re-designated from time to time.
C. Any activity otherwise prohibited by this Ordinance constituting maintenance or
improvement of existing crop or pasture land for continued agricultural use upon
certification of the Grafton County Conservation District required by the
Regulations of the Department of Environmental Services and compliance with
the other requirements for qualification of such activity as a minimum impact
project under such regulations.
D. Notice required by this section must be filed with the Clerk of the Town of
Hanover at least 15 days before the activity begins with a copy to be transmitted
by the Town Clerk to the Hanover Conservation Commission. In the case of
matters permitted under Subsection A, the notice must be that required by the
New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services in order that the proposed
activity be processed as under a permit by notification or a minimum impact
expedited application, as the case may be. In the case of matters permitted under
Subsection B, the notice must identify the applicant, the proposed activity, and
factual material sufficient to establish the basis for the applicability of this
section. In the case of matters permitted under Subsection C, the notice must be a
copy of the certification of the Grafton County Conservation District.
1103.6 The Zoning Administrator may grant an administrative permit for any of the
activities itemized in this section that otherwise would be prohibited by Section 1103.2
(the itemization of matters should not be construed to permit evasion by piecemeal
activity of the necessity for review by the Zoning Board of Adjustment):
A. Activity in a protected buffer necessitated by, resulting from, or associated with
activity in water resources permitted under Section 1103.5 A, upon a
demonstration to the Zoning Administrator, found satisfactory by the Zoning
Administrator, that the activity is the feasible alternative with the least adverse
impact on the associated water resource.
B. Any activity that is otherwise prohibited by this Ordinance but that is permitted to
proceed upon filing of a Notification of Forest Management or Timber Harvest
Activities Having Minimum Wetlands Impact under procedures adopted by the
New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, upon a determination by
the Zoning Administrator that such application is complete. The administrative
permit authorized by this Subsection B must include a condition that the activities
authorized by the Permit must be conducted in accordance with best management
practices as described in the most recent edition at the time the permit is granted

of the publication Best Management Practices for Erosion Control on Timber
Harvesting Operations in New Hampshire published by the New Hampshire
Department of Resources and Economic Development.
C. Any of the following activities otherwise prohibited by this Ordinance, upon a
finding by the Zoning Administrator that the criteria set forth in Subsections A
through E inclusive of Section 1103.7 have been satisfied. None of the following
exceptions is available for activity in any vernal pool or its buffer.
(1) Activity that disturbs, in the aggregate, less than 200 square feet in a wetland,
waterbody or intermittent stream, 1000 square feet in the associated 25 foot
buffer, and 3,000 square feet in the associated 25 foot to 75 foot buffer and
does not increase drainage into the wetland, waterbody or intermittent stream
during or after construction. Disturbance caused by silt fence installation
before or during construction is permitted and is not included in the
calculation of permitted disturbance.
(2) Activity within a wetland or intermittent stream or a buffer of a wetland in
cases in which the wetland or intermittent stream comprises, in the aggregate,
less than 2000 square feet. This permission does not exempt activities from
Zoning Board of Adjustment review to the extent they may adversely affect
the functioning of other waterbodies or wetlands.
(3) Activity associated with repair, reconstruction and/or maintenance of existing
legal structures, improvements, or features, even though another activity
which would currently require a special exception or administrative permit
has previously been undertaken on the same lot, in or adjacent to the same
wetland or waterbody, provided that:
a. Such structures, improvements, or features were constructed in
conformity with the Hanover Zoning Ordinance then in effect;
b. The repair, maintenance, or reconstruction involves no change in the size,
volume, extent, or location of the related wetland or waterbody; and
c. The repair, maintenance, or reconstruction involves no change in the
footprint size, volume, placement, height, or extent of the related feature
or improvement.
In any five year period for any lot, there may be no more than two administrative
permits granted under this Section 1103.6 C. Special exception review is required
for any additional permit.
D. The applicant shall submit the information required by the Department of
Planning and Zoning on forms established for that purpose. In establishing
information requirements, the Department of Planning and Zoning shall attempt,
where reasonable, to ask for and rely on the same information as is required to be
submitted by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services and/or
the United States Army Corps of Engineers for parallel or comparable regulatory
permits:
(1) The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating to the Zoning
Administrator that the permit should be issued.
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 113
(2) The Zoning Administrator may require information in addition to that
submitted by the applicant if needed to determine whether or not an
administrative permit should be granted under this Section 1103.6.
E. If an administrative permit is granted under this Section 1103.6, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify abutters via first class mail, at the expense of the
applicant, specifying the time by which any appeal must be filed. An appeal of the
Zoning Administrator’s decision may be made to the Zoning Board of Adjustment
under Section 206 by the applicant, by any official body of the Town, or by any
person directly affected.
1103.7 The following standards and procedures apply to any activity permitted by special
exception:
A. Activities otherwise restricted under Section 1103.2 and not permitted under
Subsections 1103.4, 1103.5 or 1103.6 may be permitted only if the Zoning Board
of Adjustment finds that the proposal conforms to the standards set forth in this
Subsection 1103.7. The burden of demonstrating satisfaction of those standards,
including the use of mitigation measures if needed, is upon the applicant.
(1) Avoidance: the proposed activity cannot reasonably be located on that
portion of the lot lying outside of any water resource and water resource
buffer, and will not cause random or unnecessary destruction of water
resources.
(2) Minimization: the manner in which the applicant proposes to meet his or her
needs and objectives is the reasonable and feasible alternative with the least
adverse impact on water resources and their buffers. In considering feasible
alternatives, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may, in its discretion, grant a
request for a special exception from dimensional requirements of this
Ordinance if, in its judgment, preservation of water resources and their
buffers justifies such special exception. (See Section 207.2). The Zoning
Board of Adjustment will not, in any event, create a specific, identified
hazard to public health safety or welfare in order to preserve a water resource
or a water resource buffer.
(3) Functions and values assessment: the proposed activity, when considered
together with any proposed and approved mitigation measures, will not result
in any unreasonable and significant net adverse effect on the natural function
of any water resources or their buffers in the area. The applicant shall submit
a functional assessment, prepared by a certified wetland scientist in all cases
except those involving a homeowner proposing activity on his own behalf
relating to his or her primary residence, of the impacted wetland site and
proposed mitigation site(s) if any, using the considerations set forth in the US
Army Corps of Engineers New England District’s The Highway
Methodology Workbook Supplement Wetland Functions and Values,
Appendix A Wetland Evaluation Supporting Documentation as a guide
for the assessment. Such natural function considerations include
groundwater recharge/discharge, alteration of flood flow or low flow, fish
and shellfish habitat, sediment/toxicant/pathogen retention, nutrient
removal/retention/transformation, production export, sediment/shoreline
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 114
stabilization, wildlife habitat, recreation, education/scientific value,
uniqueness/heritage, visual quality/aesthetics, and endangered species
habitat. In considering the application, the Zoning Board of Adjustment will
take into consideration any compensatory mitigation proposal submitted to
the Division of Water Resources of the Department of Environmental
Services of the State of New Hampshire under Regulation Env-Wt 800 et
seq.
(4) Water quality: The proposed activity will not cause significant degradation
in the quality of surface or ground water.
(5) Water quantity: The following water quantity standards are observed:
a. Peak flow: The proposed activity will not increase the peak run off rate
of surface water from 2-, 10-, 25-year 24 hour storms into any wetland or
waterbody wherever located.
b. Water recharge: The applicant will take measures to reasonably ensure
that the volume of water diverted by impervious surfaces created by the
proposed activity in 2-, 10-, 25-year 24 hour storms will infiltrate as
ground water (be “recharged”) elsewhere on the affected lot.
c. Licensed Engineer required: In the case of a lot that includes structures
and improvements consisting of roadways, driveways, parking areas,
walkways, facilities built from concrete or asphalt, decks or porches
without roofs the surface area of which aggregates 7500 square feet or
more from which water flows directly into wetlands or waterbodies,
wherever located, the volume of water diverted by such surfaces and the
recharge capacity must be calculated by a New Hampshire licensed
professional engineer. The recharge capacity is calculated using the
following formula:
Re = (F)(A)(I)/12, where
Re = Recharge volume in acre feet (multiply by 43,560 to convert to
cubic feet):
F = Recharge factor below based upon NRCS hydrologic soil group (in
inches):
Group A 0.40, Group B 0.25, Group C 0.10, and Group D no
requirement;
A = Site area in acres; and
I = Percent of impervious surfaces specified above (expressed as a
decimal).
(6) Erosion control: The proposed activity will not, either during or after
construction, cause or pose any unreasonable and avoidable threat of soil
erosion or increased silting into any wetland or waterbody, or unreasonably
cause erosion or accumulation of sediment on any adjoining property.
B. In judging reasonableness under clauses (1) through (6) above, the Zoning Board
of Adjustment shall balance the protection of water resources with the public
interest in the protection of historic resources, scenic views, and agricultural soils.
ZONING ORDINANCE 2019 TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
05/14/2019 115
C. Requirements for application for special exception are:
(1) For any special exception under Section 1103.7, the applicant shall submit
the information required by the Office of Planning and Zoning on forms
established for that purpose. In establishing information requirements, the
Office of Planning and Zoning shall attempt, where reasonable, to ask for and
rely on the same information as is required to be submitted by the New
Hampshire Department of Environmental Services and/or the United States
Army Corps of Engineers for parallel or comparable regulatory permits.
(2) The Zoning Board of Adjustment may request additional information if
needed to determine whether or not a special exception should be granted
under Section 1103.7. When delineation of boundaries of water resources and
their buffers, or the application of decisional criteria, is in doubt, the Zoning
Board of Adjustment or Zoning Administrator may require the applicant to
submit a delineation or assessment prepared by a certified wetlands scientist
or other person whose qualifications are satisfactory to the Board or
Administrator, as the case may be, or, in the alternative, if the applicant so
elects, at the applicant’s expense, the Board or Administrator may engage
such a consultant to determine the delineation and/or conduct the assessment.
(3) For any proposal for which subdivision or site plan approval by the Planning
Board is required, no application for special exception or administrative
permit may be accepted until the design review phase of subdivision or site
plan review has been completed; the application for special exception or
administrative permit must reflect the Planning Board’s resulting
recommendations.
1103.8 A copy of all notifications or applications under Sections 1103.5, 1103.6 or
1103.7 must be sent to the Conservation Commission promptly upon filing with the Clerk
of the Town of Hanover or the Zoning Administrator, as the case may be. The
Conservation Commission may, in its discretion, review and comment upon any such
request. In the case of an application for a special exception under Section 1103.7, the
Conservation Commission or its Chair may request from the Zoning Board of Adjustment
additional time of up to 30 days to complete its review and comment before a final
decision is made. The Conservation Commission may request information in addition to
that submitted by the applicant if it considers the information necessary for it to decide
what recommendation to make to the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The Zoning Board of
Adjustment shall review and make part of the record any comments from the
Conservation Commission with regard to any request for a special exception. Applicants,
abutters and other parties shall be given an opportunity to review and respond to any
comments from the Conservation Commission.
1103.9 In the event of a conflict with the requirements of other sections of this
Ordinance, including Section 1102, the stricter requirement applies.

The subdivider shall pay the filing fees according to the schedule of fees adopted by the
Selectmen and placed on file in the Office of the Planning Board Coordinator. In addition, the
Board may require the subdivider to pay additional reasonable fees to cover its administrative
expenses and costs of special investigative studies, review of documents, and other matters which
may be required by particular applications (RSA 676:4[g]). Such additional fees may also include
an appropriate allocation of legal fees incurred by the Board.
4.05 Types of Subdivision:
For the purposes of these Regulations five types of subdivision are defined. Types a. and b. may
involve residential, commercial, or industrial development.
a. Minor Subdivision:
A subdivision resulting in no more than 3 lots and requiring no new streets, utilities, or
public improvements. The procedure, requiring only the Final Plat, is set forth in Article
6.
b. Major Subdivision:
Any subdivision resulting in 4 or more lots or requiring new streets, utilities, or public
improvements. Applications are normally processed in three steps: an informal
discussion, a review of the preliminary layout, and a review of and public hearing on the
Final Plat. Procedure and requirements are set forth in Article 7.
c. Open Space Subdivision:
An optional form of subdivision for single-family housing allowing the division of land
into lots of reduced dimensions and the sharing of open space. Procedure and
requirements are set forth in Article 8.
d. Subdivision for Planned Residential Development:
A form of subdivision for mixed housing types in which the buildings are grouped in a
harmonious pattern allowing a greater proportion of open space than with Cluster
Subdivision. Procedure and requirements are set forth in Article 9.
e. Subdivision for Continuing Care Retirement Community:
A form of subdivision to allow a more useful and flexible pattern of retirement and
elderly housing. Procedure and requirements are set forth in Article 10.

ARTICLE 5. PLATTING PROCEDURE AND SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
The Planning Board believes that the best use of land is made when the characteristics of a property are
thoroughly understood, the impact on land of high or moderate resource value is minimized, and the best
places for buildings are selected from the remaining land. Land planning is not an exercise in geometry,
but a rational process of site assessment and careful design. Therefore, all subdivisions of more than
three lots shall include documentation of a four-step design process in determining the layout of proposed
opens space, house sites, roads and lot lines, as described in Section 5.02 C6.
The Planning Board’s review process for major subdivisions consists of three required phases: Concept
Plan—Preliminary Conceptual Consultation, Design Review, and Final Plat, described below. By
providing the applicant with the opportunity to meet with the Board informally for Concept Plan Review
and again for Design Review prior to submitting the final plan set, the applicant will likely save the
expense of revising a fully-engineered final plan set.
5.01 CONCEPT PLAN REVIEW-PRELIMINARY CONCEPTUAL CONSULTATIONAn
informal, broad, and general discussion:
A. Objective:
Informal discussion of a concept plan is required by the Planning Board to help prospective
applicants and the Board better understand the property and to help establish an overall design
approach that respects its special features, while providing for the density permitted under the
Zoning Ordinance. The scope of the informal discussion between the prospective applicant and
the Board shall be broad and general. Its purpose is to familiarize the Board with the location and
general character of the land and its surroundings, to discuss the Master Plan goals and policies
with the prospective applicant, to inform the Board about the concept and type of development
proposed, and for the Board to provide the prospective applicant with guidance about the
requirements for process and submissions as set forth in the Subdivision Regulations.
B. Procedure:
Upon request of a prospective applicant, the Planning Board Administrator shall place a Concept
Plan Review on the agenda of the Planning Board at a regularly scheduled meeting. No fee shall
be assessed for the Concept Plan Review. Notice to abutters by the applicant is not required but
is recommended.
C. Information Requested:
The concept plan should convey a general understanding of important features of a site proposed
for subdivision. A formal survey is not necessary. Submission of the following information is
recommended, as it will be helpful to the board’s advice. The following information will be
helpful in making an assessment:
1. Name and address of the legal owner and the applicant;
2. List of relevant sections of the Master Plan;
3. Name and address of the person responsible for preparing the plan, if applicable;
4. Bar scale (not greater than 1" = 200 ft.; however, dimensions on the plan need not be
exact at this stage) and north arrow;
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 8
5. Approximate tract boundaries, sufficient to locate the tract on a map of Hanover;
6. Map of the project location in Hanover;
7. Zoning district;
8. Roads on and adjacent to the tract (both existing and proposed);
9. Approximate location of any wetlands and 100 year floodplain;
10. General location of topographic, physical, and cultural features including:
a. cover type and character, significant trees, views and knolls;
b. steep slopes (over 25%), rock outcrops, and soil types;
c. water features on the tract and within two hundred (200) feet of the tract such as
streams, ponds, ditches, and drains;
d. existing rights-of-way and easements; and
e. all cultural features such as all structures, foundations, walls, wells, dumps,
storage tanks, trails, and serviceable woods roads.
11. Schematic layout indicating a general concept for land conservation and development;
and
12. Abutting land uses (e.g. residence, business, park).
D. Action of the Board:
Following the Concept Plan Review, the Board shall advise the prospective applicant as to
subsequent submission requirements and procedures.
5.02 DESIGN REVIEW:
A. Objective:
The applicant is required to submit a Design Review plan set to the Planning Board Administrator
for design review by the Town staff and the Planning Board. Its purpose is to provide a full
understanding of the site's potential, to carefully evaluate natural constraints and development
options, to identify and consider concerns of the neighbors, to identify any municipal
infrastructure limitations, and to facilitate effective exchange with the Planning Board. At the
successful conclusion of this phase, both the applicant and the Planning Board will have agreed
upon a preferred development and conservation concept for the area proposed for subdivision.
B. Procedure:
1. Submissions:
Submissions shall be made no later than noon on the first Tuesday of the submission
month. Within two weeks, Town staff will review the Design Review Plan with the
applicant and their professional design team. The staff evaluation at this stage will not
entail a detailed engineering review. Staff comments will be limited to identifying
potential challenges in providing any new municipal infrastructure and to addressing the
impact on the municipal infrastructure. The Town staff may suggest modification to the
Design Review Plan set prior to submission to the Planning Board. Seventeen copies of
the Design Review Plan set shall be submitted to the Planning Board Administrator, no
less than 13 days prior to the first Tuesday of the hearing month.
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 9
2. Notice:
The Planning and Zoning Staff shall provide notice of the submission of the application
and of public hearing on the Town website, in two places in town, in the newspaper, to
the applicant, to the abutters, to the consultants contributing to the plan submission, and
to the holders of conservation easements on the property or abutting lands.
3. Review of the Design:
At the hearing, the Planning Board shall review the Design Review Plan to assess its
accuracy, conformance with the Master Plan and local ordinances, and likely impact upon
the neighborhood and others, Town services and infrastructure, and natural and cultural
resources on the property and abutting properties.
In its review of the Design Review Plan, the Planning Board shall request that the
applicant explain the results of the four-step design process used to develop the
Preliminary Layout (5.02 C7). The Board may request additional information to assist in
its review of the Design Review Plan. The Board may solicit comments from abutters
and other interested persons as it deems appropriate.
At the first meeting to review the Design Review Plan with the Planning Board, the
applicant shall arrange for a site visit to the property with the Planning Board. The site
analysis and other maps prepared for the Design Review Plan shall be available during
the visit. The purpose of the visit is to familiarize Planning Board members with the
property’s existing conditions and special features, to identify potential site design issues,
and provide an opportunity to discuss site plan concepts, including the layout of the open
space and potential locations for proposed buildings and road alignments.
C. Information to be Provided:
The submission materials for the Design Review shall consist of the following elements, and be
prepared in accordance with the drafting standards and plan requirements described herein. The
Board may request that specific additional items be submitted to assist them in their review.
1. Ownership and Contact Information:
Ownership and contact information is requested to facilitate contact with the
professionals involved in preparing the submission.
a. The following names, addresses and telephone numbers shall appear on the
Design Review Plan:
(1) Name of municipality and subdivision;
(2) Name and address of the legal owner of the subject property, and the
name and address of the applicant if not the same party;
(3) Name and address of every engineer, architect, land surveyor, soil
scientist or designer responsible for preparing any part of the submission;
and
(4) Names and addresses of abutters and holders of trail, conservation,
preservation, or agricultural easements or restrictions on the subject
property or on abutting properties.
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 10
b. The applicant shall submit a deed or agreement of sale evidencing that the
applicant is the legal owner of the land to be subdivided or has been authorized to
represent the legal owner.
2. Description of Design Review Plans:
The Design Review Plans shall be submitted in 10 paper prints for staff review and,
following staff review 17 paper prints for Planning Board review and hearing.
Dimensions may be approximate; data may be tentative but shall be sufficiently clear to
establish the basis of and to clarify the design requirements for the subdivision Final
Plan. Guidelines for preparing plans for the Design Review are:
a. Except for the site context map, the plan shall be drawn to a scale of either
1"=100' or 1"=200', whichever would fit best on a standard size sheet no larger
than 34" x 44" nor smaller than 17" x 22", unless otherwise approved by the
Planning Board.
b. All plans shall include a bar scale, north arrow, date of revisions and list of
revisions.
c. Dimensions shall be set in feet.
d. Each sheet shall be numbered and the plan shall provide an adequate legend
indicating clearly which features are existing and which are proposed.
e. All plans and maps shall bear the contact information in Section 5.02 C1.
3. Site Context Map:
A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision within its neighborhood context
shall be submitted. This map should clearly show how natural and cultural features on the
site relate to natural and cultural features off the site. Guidelines for preparation of this
map are:
a. For sites under 100 acres in area, maps shall be at a scale not less than 1"= 200',
and shall show the relationship of the subject property to natural and man-made
features existing within a distance sufficient to provide context for the
development but not less than 200 feet from the boundary of the site.
b. For sites of 100 acres or more, the scale shall be 1" = 400', and shall show the
relationship of the subject property to natural and man-made features within a
distance sufficient to provide context for the development but not less than 200
feet from the boundary of the site.
c. The features that shall be shown on Site Context Map are:
(1) Topography (from U.S.G.S. maps),
(2) Stream valleys,
(3) Wetlands (from maps published by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service or
the U.S.D.A. Natural Resources Conservation Service),
(4) Woodlands over one-half acre in area (from aerial photographs; check to
see if available at Town Offices),
(5) Ridge lines,
(6) Public roads and trails,
(7) Utility easements and rights of way, public land including but not limited
to land in governmental ownership and land accessible to the public,
(8) Land protected by conservation easements, and
(9) Buildings, roads, trails, and driveways within a minimum of 200 feet
from the property boundary.
4. Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan:
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 11
For all subdivisions (except those in which all proposed lots are to be fifty or more acres
in area), an Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan shall be prepared to provide the
developer and the Planning Board with a comprehensive graphic analysis of existing
conditions, both on the proposed development site and features within a distance
sufficient to provide context for the development but not less than 200 feet from the
boundary of the site. The purpose of this Plan is to identify site features that should be
worked into the project design to be consistent with the principles of the Master Plan, to
minimize environmental impact, and to benefit future residents.
Conditions beyond the parcel boundaries may be described on the basis of existing
published data available from town and other governmental agencies, and from aerial
photographs (Check to see if these are available at Town Offices.)
The following information shall be included in this Plan:
a. A vertical aerial photograph enlarged to a scale not less detailed than 1”= 400’,
with the site boundaries clearly marked.(Check to see if available at Town
Offices.)
b. The best available topography, which may be the USGS 20- foot or 6- meter
contour intervals information. The determination of appropriate contour intervals
shall be made by the Planning Board, which may specify greater or lesser
intervals for exceptionally steep or flat areas. Slopes between 15 and 25 percent
and slopes exceeding 25 percent shall be delineated. (Concerns about slope are
explained in the Master Plan, Chapter 3, pages 8-9, and Chapter 4, pages 8 and
14.)
c. Location of water features such as ponds, vernal pools, streams, ditches, drains,
and natural drainage patterns, as well as the 100-year floodplains, wetlands and
wetland and waterbody setbacks, as defined in the Zoning Ordinance. (Concerns
about water features are explained in the Master Plan, Chapter 3, pages 8-9, and
Chapter 4, pages 2- 6 and 11- 14.)
d. Vegetative cover conditions on the property according to general cover type
including cultivated land, permanent grass land, meadow, pasture, old field,
hedgerow, woodland and wetland. (Concerns about vegetation are explained in
the Master Plan, Chapter 4, pages 8- 10 and 14- 15.)
e. Soil types, as mapped by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources
Conservation Service in the Grafton County soil survey, and accompanying data,
published for each soil relating to its suitability for construction (and, in unsewered
areas, for septic suitability). If necessary, the Planning Board may
request a more detailed soil survey of all or part of the property during the
preliminary design phase. (Concerns about soils are explained in the Master Plan,
Chapter 3, pages 7- 9, and Chapter 4, pages 7- 8, 11 and 14.)
f. Ridge lines, hilltops and watershed boundaries shall be identified. (Concerns
about ridgelines and hilltops are explained in the Master Plan, Chapter 3, pages
8-9, and Chapter 4, pages 10- 11 and 14- 15.)
g. Identify significant views into the property from public roads and from public
lands and public trails. (Concerns about views are explained in the Master Plan,
Chapter 3, page 13, and Chapter 4, pages 10-11 and 15.)
h. Geologic features such as rock out-croppings, cliffs, and eskers, based on
available published information or visible on-site.
i. All existing cultural features, including but not limited to roads, driveways, farm
roads, woods roads, abandoned roads, buildings, foundations, walls, wells,
dumps, storage tanks, utilities, fire hydrants, drainage fields, and storm and
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 12
sanitary sewers. Off site public or private wells located within 100 feet of the
property boundary should also be shown.
j. Locations of all historic artifacts on the tract, including but not limited to
cellarholes, stone walls, earthworks, and graves.
k. Locations of trails that have been in public use, such as pedestrian, equestrian,
snow machine and bicycle trails.
l. All rights-of-way and easements that are or have been filed of record with the
Register of Deeds of Grafton County shall be shown on the plan.
m. Total acreage of the tract.
5. Density Analysis:
In the case of a planned residential development, upon completion of the four-step design
process described below and consistent with the objectives set forth for Planned
Residential Developments in Section 502.1 of the Zoning Ordinance, the Planning Board
may reduce the density from that set forth in the Zoning Ordinance, although a formal
yield plan is not required.
For all other major subdivisions, a yield plan is required in order to determine the density
suitable to the site. Determination of density (the maximum number of permitted lots or
dwelling units) shall be based upon the density set forth in the Zoning Ordinance. A yield
plan shall be prepared containing proposed lots that conform to the lot- based standards
set forth in the Zoning Ordinance, roads, rights of way, and other pertinent features.
Although it must be drawn to scale, it need not be based on a field survey. However, it
must be a realistic, reasonable, regular and ordinary layout reflecting a development
pattern that could be expected to be implemented, taking into account the presence of
wetlands, wetland setbacks, floodplains, steep slopes, existing easements and
encumbrances, well placement and hydrologic yield and, if un-sewered, the suitability of
soils for subsurface sewage disposal. The Planning Board may require test pits to
demonstrate the suitability.
For any development subject to these regulations, the Planning Board may as a result of
this process reduce the density permitted on a particular site.
6. Outcomes of the Four Step Design Process:
The Planning Board believes that the best use is made of land when the characteristics of
a property are thoroughly understood, impact on lands of high or moderate resource value
is minimized, and the best places for buildings are selected from the remaining lands.
Land planning is not an exercise in geometry, but a rational process of site assessment
and careful design. Therefore, all subdivisions of more than three lots shall include
documentation of a four-step design process in determining the layout of proposed open
space, house sites, roads and lot lines, as described below. Applicants shall be prepared to
submit a separate sketch map indicating the findings of each step of the design process, in
this Design Review phase.
a. Four Step Design Process for Major Subdivisions:
Step 1: Delineation of Lands of High and Moderate Resource Value:
(1) Determine the minimum percentage and acreage of required open space
lands, if any. Show the location of all environmentally sensitive lands of
high resource value: floodplains, wetlands, headwaters of major streams,
perennial stream courses and adjacent natural buffers, and steep slopes.
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 13
(2) Lands of moderate resource value (lands with important agricultural soils
and moderate slopes, aquifers, hilltops and ridgelines, significant
identified wildlife habitats and corridors, and areas of identified
biodiversity) should be indicated, but not necessarily shown as open
space. In delineating lands of moderate resource value, the applicant
shall prioritize natural and cultural resources on the tract in terms of their
highest to least suitability for inclusion in the proposed open space. This
determination may be refined in consultation with the Planning Board at
the Design Review.
(3) Proposed open space lands and the development land shall be designated
using the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan, prepared for Design
Review (5.02 C4), as a base map.
(4) On the basis of those priorities and practical considerations given to the
tract's configuration, its context in relation to resource areas on adjoining
and neighboring properties, and the applicant's subdivision objectives,
lands of moderate resource value shall be delineated to meet at least the
minimum area percentage requirements for open space lands, if any, and
in a manner clearly indicating their boundaries as well as the types of
resources included within them.
Step 2: Location of Building Sites:
Potential building sites shall be tentatively located, using the proposed
open space lands as a base map as well as other relevant data on the
Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan such as topography and soils.
Building sites should generally be located with careful consideration
given to potential impacts on lands of high and moderate resource value.
The potential negative impacts of residential development on such areas
as well as the potential positive benefits of such locations to provide
attractive views and visual settings for residences ought to be assessed.
An adequate measure of protection against negative impacts should be
provided by protective margins between development and lands of high
and moderate resource value. Buildings, accessory buildings, and
building setback lines should also be indicated.
Step 3: Alignment of Roads, Driveways and Trails:
When building sites have been designated, a road and driveway plan
shall be designed to provide vehicular access to each house, complying
with the standards in Article 14 and bearing a logical relationship to
topographic conditions. Impacts of the road plan on proposed open space
lands and lands of high and moderate resource value shall be minimized,
particularly with respect to crossing environmentally sensitive areas such
as wetlands and traversing slopes exceeding 15%. Road connections
shall generally be encouraged to minimize the number of new cul-desacs
and to facilitate access to and from homes in different parts of the
tract and adjoining parcels.
Step 4: Drawing in the Lot Lines:
When steps 1 through 3 are completed, lot lines are drawn as required to
delineate the boundaries of individual residential lots.
b. Four-Step Site Design Process Option for Village Centers:
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 14
The design process for laying out Village Centers shall be a variation on the fourstep
process for subdivisions, as described above. In developments where
traditional streetscape and "terminal vistas" are of greater importance, Steps 2
and 3 may be reversed, so that roads and squares are located during the second
step, and house sites are located immediately thereafter.
7. Preliminary Layout and Improvements Plan:
The results of the Four-Step Design Process (5.02 C6) provide the basis for development
of the Preliminary Layout and Improvements Plan. The Preliminary Layout and
Improvements Plan shows how the development proposed for the property has been
integrated with the neighborhood features identified on the Site Context Map (5.02 C3)
and the existing resources portrayed on the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan
(5.02 C4). For clarity, this plan may be submitted as a plan set on a number of sheets.
This plan shall include the following items:
a. Cultural resources, trails and significant natural features, including topography,
areas of steep slope, wetlands, 100-year floodplains, drainage features, rock
outcroppings, vegetation, existing utilities, and other site features, as indicated on
the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan (5.02 C4).
b. Boundaries and area of the entire parcel owned by the applicant, whether or not
all land therein is to be subdivided, referenced to a public road intersection or
USGS bench mark; north arrow, bar scale, date, and list of all revisions,
including the date of each revision. Existing and approximate proposed lot lines,
lot areas, any existing easements, deed restrictions and rights-of-way.
c. Boundaries and designations of zoning districts within the subdivision, municipal
boundary, if any, and land use designations from the Master Plan.
d. Approximate location, alignment, width and tentative names of all proposed
roads and road rights-of-way, including all road extensions or spurs that are
reasonably necessary to provide adequate road connections and facilities to
adjoining development or undeveloped areas; and preliminarily-engineered
profiles for proposed roads. Developed in collaboration with the Department of
Public Works, an assessment of the existing road system serving the development
should be prepared for discussion with the Board.
e. Approximate location of proposed significant drainage features, drainage
easements, stormwater and other drainage structures. Developed in collaboration
with the Department of Public Works, an assessment of the existing drainage
system serving the development, if any, should be should be prepared for
discussion with the Board.
f. Where community sewage service is to be permitted, the conceptual layout of
proposed sewage systems, including but not limited to the tentative locations of
sewer mains and sewage treatment plants. Developed in collaboration with the
Department of Public Works, an assessment of the existing sewer system serving
the development, if any, should be should be prepared for discussion with the
Board.
g. Where central water service is to be permitted, the conceptual layout of proposed
water distribution facilities including water mains, fire hydrants, storage tanks
and, where appropriate, wells and other water sources. Developed in
collaboration with the Department of Public Works, an assessment of the existing
water system, if any, serving the development should be should be prepared for
discussion with the Board.
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 15
h. Location of all boring data and test pits, including all failed pits including a brief
description of the limiting factor, e.g. ledge, high water table, etc. Areas for leach
fields should be large enough for both a State-approved primary and alternate bed
for each septic system. Approved sites shall be clearly distinguished from
unapproved sites.
i. Approximate location and dimensions of proposed playgrounds, public buildings,
public areas and trails, and parcels of land proposed to be dedicated or reserved
for public use.
j. If land to be subdivided lies partly in or abuts another municipality, the applicant
shall submit information concerning the location and conceptual design of roads,
layout and size of lots, and provisions of public improvements on land subject to
the applicant’s control within the adjoining municipality. The design of public
improvements shall provide for a smooth, practical transition where
specifications vary between municipalities.
k. Preliminary road plan with rough indication of expected grades, road right-ofway
lines, and approximate location of proposed road right-of-way lines.
l. Utilities and Easements:
Locations of existing utility easements and approximate locations of proposed
utility easements, telephone, TV, cable, electric and fire protection lines, and
existing and proposed fire suppression systems such as cisterns and fire ponds.
8. Preliminary Resource Impact and Conservation Plan:
This requirement for a Preliminary Resource Impact and Conservation Plan may be
waived by the Planning Board if, in its judgment, the proposed development areas, as laid
out in the Concept Plan or in the Design Review Plan, would be likely to cause no more
than an insignificant impact upon the site's resources. Alternatively, several iterations of
this Plan may be required to compare the impacts of the proposed Preliminary Layouts
developed in the course of the Four-Step Design process.
Using the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan (as described in Section 5.02 C4)
and the Preliminary Layout (as described in Section 5.02 C7), a Preliminary Resource
Impact and Conservation Plan shall be prepared to categorize the impacts of the proposed
activities and physical alterations on those resources. All improvements proposed in the
other Preliminary Layout documents, including but not necessarily limited to grading,
fill, roads, buildings, utilities and stormwater detention facilities, shall be taken into
account in preparing the Preliminary Resource Impact and Conservation Plan. The
applicant shall clearly demonstrate that site disturbance and off-site impacts have been
minimized to the greatest extent practicable.
Using the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan as a base map, impact areas shall be
mapped according to the following categories:
a. Primary impact areas, i.e., areas directly impacted by the proposed
subdivision,
b. Secondary impact areas, i.e., areas in proximity to primary areas which may be
impacted, and
c. Designated protected areas, to be included as open space, such as dedication of a
neighborhood park site, public recreation amenity or resource protection/
conservation area, and any open space areas designated for maintenance and
improvement.
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 16
D. Action of the Board:
After review of the Design Review Plan and site visit by the Board, the Board shall convey to the
applicant its recommendations, reservations, and requirements with respect to the proposed
subdivision and the advisability of preparing a Final Plat.
In its recommendations the Planning Board shall state the number of lots or units permitted in the
proposed subdivision. The number may be less than that suggested by the Zoning Ordinance
because of conditions of the site or of municipal infrastructure. In the SR-1, SR-2 and RR
Districts, the Planning Board’s recommendation on the layout shall state whether or not an Open
Space Subdivision or Planned Residential Development is preferable and recommended, and shall
advise the applicant concerning subsequent procedures and submission requirements. The
applicant may submit a revised Design Review Plan for review by the Board prior to proceeding
to development of a Final Plat.
5.03 FINAL PLAT:
A. Objective:
The purpose of this review is to ensure that the application is complete and that the Planning
Board has sufficient information to make an informed decision. The decision involves
ascertaining whether or not the final plat: conforms with the Master Plan and local regulations;
provides a full understanding of the site's potential; carefully evaluates natural constraints;
determines the impacts on the neighborhood, natural resources, town services and infrastructure;
and responds to concerns of the neighbors and others.
B. Procedure:
1. Submission for staff review and Planning Board review:
An application for Final Plan approval for review and action by the Board shall be
submitted to the Planning Board Administrator. Submissions shall be made no later than
noon on the first Tuesday of the submission month. It is required that prior to submission
the applicant shall have developed a road and utility plan satisfactory to the Director of
the Department of Public Works.
Within the following two weeks, but usually on the following Monday, Town staff will
review the Final Plan with the applicant and design team. Depending upon comments
from the Town staff, the Final Plan may need to be modified prior to submission to the
Planning Board. When the applicant has prepared a Final Plan with waiver requests as
necessary, which constitutes a submission that is in the determination of Town Staff
acceptable for review and sufficient for the Planning Board to make an informed
decision, 17 copies of the Final Plan shall be submitted to the Planning Board
Administrator. If the Town staff should determine that the Final Plan is insufficient, the
applicant must provide the pertinent information or request a waiver from the Planning
Board for that part of the submission. This final submission shall be made no less than 13
days prior to the first Tuesday of the hearing month, which shall be the month
immediately following the submission month in most cases.
2. Notice for Submission to the Planning Board and Public Hearing:
The Planning Board Administrator shall cause notice to be posted on the Town website
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 17
and in two places in town, to be published in a newspaper, and to be sent to the applicant,
abutters, consultants contributing to the plan submission, and holders of conservation
easements on the property or abutting lands. As provided by law, any public meeting or
hearing for which notice was required may be adjourned without additional notice. The
Board shall announce at the prior public meeting or prior public hearing that such
meeting or hearing shall be adjourned to a fixed day, time, and place. For a valid

other ordinances or regulations, the more stringent or those setting the higher standard shall
apply.
11.02 Character of Land for Subdivision:
Land of such character that it cannot, in the opinion of the Board, be safely used for building
development because of danger to health or peril from fire, flood, poor drainage, excessive slope,
or other hazardous conditions, shall not be platted for residential, commercial, or industrial
subdivision, nor for such other uses as may increase danger to life or property. All proposals for
subdivision of land shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. Land with

outcroppings, water bodies, stone walls, boundary markers, and historic landmarks, shall be
preserved and protected to the maximum extent possible by the subdivider. The subdivider shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board the manner by which he or she intends to protect
existing features.
11.05 Off-site Improvements:
If, upon the finding of fact, the Board determines that the proposed subdivision will adversely
affect existing public facilities, such as streets, sidewalks, drainage, sewer, and water supply,
causing them to be inadequate to meet the additional needs created by the subdivision, then the
subdivider shall pay for such up-grading of the public facilities to an extent necessary to protect
the public interest. If other properties benefit from the upgrading of such off-site public
improvements, the Board shall determine the portion of the cost to be paid by the subdivider,
taking into consideration the following elements:
a. the character of the area,
b. the extent that other public and private property will be benefited by the upgrading, and

d. Legal restrictions to preserve land for open space purposes shall run with the open space
land. Open space shall be protected from development by means such as conveyance of
the land or of a conservation easement to a government or conservation organization, or
homeowner’s association. The recipient entity of such a conveyance or assignment of
responsibility for the conservation of the open space shall be an entity capable of
protecting the open space and acceptable to the Planning Board. If a conservation
easement is used to restrict development, it shall prohibit activities that would diminish
the open space benefit or function.
e. Where necessary as determined by the Planning Board, restrictions shall provide for the
management and maintenance of the open space, including the manner and source of
providing funds for these purposes. These restrictions may be contained in any suitable
legal instrument, as approved by the Town Manager in a written statement that the

SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 43
ARTICLE 14. STREET LAYOUT AND DESIGN
14.01 Street Design and Function:
In general, the character of a street will complement the character of the land it serves and will be
consistent with its function in the town street system. In every case, the town recognizes that
streets are meant to carry goods and people whether by vehicle, by bicycle, or on foot. Street
rights-of-way will be considered multi-purpose in order to accommodate these modes of
transportation. Stormwater treatment must be considered in the design and construction of
streets. The design features are as follows:
a. Downtown “main” streets are characterized by on-street parking, sidewalks, pedestrian
cross walks, signalized intersections, street furniture, street trees, through traffic, the
slowest speeds, motorized vehicles sharing the road with bicycles, commercial activity,
and public spaces. They may be classified as local, collector or arterial depending on
traffic volume.
b. Downtown residential neighborhood streets are characterized by occasional on-street
parking, traffic calming, sidewalks, signed intersections, street trees, and slow speeds.
Motorized vehicles share the road with bicycles and pedestrians. These streets abut
private yards and may serve as local or connector roads depending on traffic volume.
c. State-numbered arterials connect villages and more densely settled places. They are
characterized by signalized intersections, street trees and sidewalks close to downtown,
bike lanes, and faster speeds.
d. Rural arterials connect hamlets and less densely settled places. They are characterized by
signed intersections, slow to moderate speeds, and paving. Motorized vehicles share the
road with bicyclists and pedestrians.
e. Rural roads may be local or collector roads and are characterized by variety of terrain,
lanes shared with bicycles and pedestrians, slow speeds, signed intersections, and a mix
of paved and unpaved roads.
f. Class VI roads are not maintained by the town. They provide access to wild land and
wood lots, and are characterized by unmanaged road-side vegetation, year-round
recreational use, and minimal or no vehicular use.
14.02 Conformance with Official Map:
The layout of all streets shall conform to the Official Map, if such exists.
14.03 Connection with Existing and Possible Future Subdivisions:
Where terrain permits and connectivity would be enhanced, new roads and recreation corridors or
easements reserved for future roads or recreation corridors may be required by the Planning
Board to extend to the boundaries of the subdivision to provide for future connectivity to adjacent
parcels. Such roads, corridors or easements should be shown on the final plat.
New road extensions and recreational corridors should be aligned so as to provide access to
existing and possible future roads or recreational corridors in adjacent subdivisions.
14.04 Adjustment of Street Alignment or Right-of-Way:
Where a subdivision abuts an existing street and the alignment or right-of-way width of such
street is rendered inadequate because of the needs created by the proposed subdivision, the
applicant shall include in the street dedication all land needed to meet the standards established
by these Regulations and as approved by the Board, and such street dedication shall be shown on
the Final Plat. The applicant may be required to correct the inadequacy.
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 44
14.05 Street Pattern:
The layout of the street pattern shall be based on a local street system connected to a collector
street system connected to an arterial street system, in conformance with the standards set forth in
Article 14.13 and 14.15. Whenever possible, local streets should form a well-connected network
that provides for safe, direct and convenient access by vehicles and pedestrians.
14.06 Harmony with Topography:
Street patterns shall give due consideration to contours and natural features. Subdivision streets
shall be laid out to blend with the existing topography. Applicants shall consider the following
guidelines in laying out new streets:
a. An alignment should be chosen that blends with the terrain and adjusts to important
natural and scenic features.
b. In most instances, the appropriate alignment will be characterized by curves that
continually adjust to the rolling topography of natural landforms. A curvilinear
alignment is visually and functionally preferable to straight segments that cut through
hillsides, leaving steep, unsightly, and unstable embankments. Blending with the
landscape reduces cut and fill quantities, may offer more efficient use of natural drainage
channels, and better controls roadside erosion because natural vegetation is preserved.
c. Where the land is level or a strong linear direction is created by landscape elements, such
as a long row of trees or patterns of fields or stone walls, the use of a straight segment
may be justified. When a straight segment is used, it should be directed toward a natural
or man-made focal point.
d. A road that climbs a hillside should wind to the crest, traversing the contours, rather than
climbing straight up.
e. A roadway that crosses a ridge should be located in a saddle or low area along the ridge
top.
f. Natural and man-made features provide variety and contrast that maintain the traveler’s
interest. Whenever possible, alignments should be located to bring more interesting
features into view.
g. Near the edges of surface water, woods, or a break in topography, alignments should
echo or emphasize the shape of the edges.
h. A roadway that approaches important features should first allow a distant view of the
object, then curve away, and finally bring the feature close for a contrasting view.
i. Consistency in the scale of horizontal and vertical elements should be maintained
whenever possible. Small dips and humps should be avoided in what is actually a
uniform grade, and short sharp curves should be avoided in what is actually a long curve.
j. Transitions between the beginning and ending of horizontal and vertical curves should be
gradual.
14.07 Intersection Alignment and Grades:
Streets intersecting at 90 degrees create the safest street intersections. Any variance from a 90-
degree intersection will be considered favorably only when there are safe sight distances, but in
general the intersection of two streets at less than a 75-degree angle may only be approved if
found by the Planning Board and Director of Public Works to be safe and convenient. The grade
within 75 feet of a travel-way of the intersection shall be no more than 5%.
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 45
No object shall impair corner visibility.
Where necessary in the judgment of the Board, signals or other intersection improvements may
be required at the intersection of the existing street providing access to the subdivision with the
new street or at an existing intersection. When such need has been created by the subdivision, the
Board may require the applicant to pay for some or all of the signals or intersection improvements
outside the subdivision.
14.08 Multiple Intersections:
Intersections involving a junction of more than four street segments shall be prohibited unless
configured as a round-about. Except at round-abouts, the minimum distance between centerlines
of successive intersections shall be 150 feet.
14.09 Connectivity and Closed-End Streets:
The preferred design for street layout is one that enhances connectivity of new streets with
existing streets. However, terrain limitations and other land use constraints sometimes prevent
connections. In these cases, a closed end street may be appropriate and may offer several
advantages. When a closed end street is proposed, the length and layout should be designed to
facilitate compact development close to existing streets, to protect open space and wildlife habitat
in unfragmented tracts of land and to prevent disruption of headwater areas and waterbodies in
order to protect water quality.
a. Closed-end streets, especially long ones, are generally discouraged because:
(1) An accident, a stalled vehicle, a fallen tree, a wash-out, a snow pile or
construction can block the access segment and the ability to reach lots farther
along the closed-end street.
(2) Traffic from all of the lots served by the closed-end street is concentrated at one
end.
(3) The first equipment arriving at a fire or other emergency may block other traffic
or equipment arriving later or interfere with the maneuvering of the equipment.
(4) Closed-end streets tend to isolate neighborhoods from other neighborhoods.
b. Where reasonably possible, closed-end streets should be connected to other nearby
closed-end streets or other nearby parts of the street system with bicycle and pedestrian
corridors on public easements or rights-of-way. Such connections to adjacent subdivision
streets and recreational corridors shall be reserved.
c. The length of the access segment of a closed-end street shall be at least equal to the
minimum lot frontage required by the Zoning Ordinance, or 150 feet, whichever is more,
configured in such a way that the frontage requirement of at least one lot is met prior to
the turnaround portion of the closed-end street.
d. The maximum centerline length of the access segment of a closed-end street shall not
exceed 500 feet, unless public benefits, such as reduced natural resource impact,
enhanced open space, preservation of valuable natural or man-made features,
enhancement or preservation of features of visual or scenic quality, or affordable housing,
are provided and documented to the satisfaction of the Planning Board.
e. No lot in a lot-based subdivision lot, or building in a Planned Residential Development
(PRD) or Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC), on a closed-end street shall
be located more than 500 feet from a public through-street; however, this distance may be
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 46
increased up to a maximum of 1000 feet, if all of the following standards are met:
(1) The extension is approved in writing by the Fire Chief, Director of Public Works
and Director of the Hanover Water Works Company (if applicable);
(2) If the lots are to be served by municipal water and the system is not otherwise
looped, there is an easement from the turnaround to another street to provide a
looped water system;
(3) There are hydrants along the closed-end road and at the turnaround, or the houses
are sprinklered;
(4) Neighborhood connectivity is accomplished via bike paths or pedestrian ways or
emergency-only links; and
(5) Public benefits, such as reduced natural resource impact, enhanced open space,
preservation of valuable natural or man-made features, enhancement or
preservation of features of visual or scenic quality, or affordable housing, are
provided and documented to the satisfaction of the Planning Board.
f. A permanent closed-end street shall terminate in a suitable turnaround. The turnaround
shall be designed and maintained to provide for adequate drainage and maneuverability
of emergency and road maintenance vehicles.
14.10 Temporary Closed-end Streets:
In the case of temporary closed-end streets, where future extension to another outlet is approved
by the Board, the full width of the right-of-way to the subdivision property line shall be reserved
as a street right-of-way and shall be shown on the Final Plat. For a closed-end street of a
temporary nature, a turnaround shall be provided and provision shall be made for future extension
of the street through to adjacent property and for reversion of any excess right-of-way to the
adjoining properties.
In a phased development, a street shall not be considered “closed-end” if shown on the approved
subdivision plan as ultimately having more than one open end intersecting with the street network
of the Town.
14.11 Curb Cuts:
Curb cuts of local and collector streets onto arterial streets shall be minimized.
14.12 Traffic Calming:
Local residential streets shall be designed to encourage connectivity, but discourage through
traffic.
In order to encourage low speeds and promote safety streets should be designed to gently
follow landforms.
Slow vehicle speeds are safer for motorists and pedestrians. Both on-site and off-site
traffic calming may be required as a result of projected traffic impacts of proposed new
development, and the applicant may be required to provide off-site traffic calming
measures or to pay some or all of the costs of such measures. (see Hanover’s Traffic
Calming Policy)
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 47
Options for retrofit include roadway striping, edge line markings, roundabouts, chokers, flashing
warning signs, intersection modifications, roadway medians, speed tables, redesign of streets,
sidewalks, landscaping and streetscape, on- street parking, and other traffic calming devices.
14.13 Conformance with Construction Standards:
All streets shall be constructed in conformance with the construction standards and specifications
adopted by the Town of Hanover Public Works Department. All bridges, culverts, drainage
structures, storm sewers, gutters, drainage ditches, and other improvements shown on the Final
Plat and required by accompanying documents, if any, shall be installed in conformance with the
construction standards and specifications adopted by the Town Public Works Department.
14.14 Road Status:
If the applicant wishes to offer dedication of a proposed roadway to the Town as a public street,
the Planning Board in approving a Final Plan may recommend to the Board of Selectmen that it
be accepted as a public street. In deciding on such a recommendation, the Planning Board shall
consider:
a. Whether the roadway will be used solely for the benefit of the residents of the
development, or also or predominantly by the public at large;
b. The number of residences served by the roadway, and associated public safety issues;
generally, roadways directly providing primary access to more than twenty dwellings
should be public streets;
c. Whether the cost to or impact on the Town is proportionate to the number of residents
benefited;
d. Whether there is to be a homeowners’ association that will be capable of maintaining the
roadway as a private way; and whether or not other amenities or site features are
proposed to be owned in common by the residents of the development and be maintained
by a homeowners’ association;
e. Input from neighbors of the proposed development;
f. Whether the roadway is to be built to Town standards; as a general rule, roadways that do
not meet Town standards will not receive the recommendation from the Planning Board
to become a public street.
Approval of the Final Plan does not constitute any obligation or representation that any roadway
shown on the plan will be accepted by the Town of Hanover as a public street or that the Town
will ever take responsibility for the roadway or its maintenance or repair.
14.15 Classification of Streets:
Whether maintained by the Town or a private entity, all streets shall provide safe access for the
residents, visitors, delivery and emergency vehicles. Street rights-of-way shall provide adequate
width for utility lines.
The standards for design for a two-way street shall be as set forth in Table A:

a straight line entirely within the street right-of-way and clear of obstructions, one of the
points to be at the surface and the other 4½ feet above the surface.
{2} Parabolic curves are defined by the K value: the length of curve divided by its change in
grade %. A vertical curve that goes from 2% grade to 6% grade in 40 m. has a K value of
10 m./% (40 m./(6%-2%)).
14.16 Marking of Proposed Streets:
At the earliest practical stage during the application the applicant shall place on the ground
clearly observable survey stakes or ribbons marking the centerline of all proposed streets.
14.17 Stormwater Treatment Measures
A major goal of road design is to minimize runoff and the concentration of stormwater from
roads. Measures to accomplish this will:
a. Avoid excessive grading, clearing, soil compaction and site disturbance;
b. respect natural hydrology by dispersing stormwater on site;
c. Minimize amount of impervious surfaces;
d. Use existing landscape features or add new landscaping measures to retain and filter
stormwater caused by paving.
14.18 Alteration of Gradient:
The Planning Board may modify the maximum and minimum gradient for short lengths of street
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 49
where, in the judgment of the Board, existing topographic conditions or the preservation of
natural features indicate that such modification will result in the best subdivision of land.
14.19 Alteration of Right-of-Way or Travel Surface:
The Planning Board may require greater width of right-of-way and/or travel surface where, in the
judgment of the Board, the demands of present or future traffic make it desirable or where
topographic conditions create a need for greater width for grading.
14.20 Curbing:
The Planning Board may require curbing with closed drainage systems in the in-Town area.
Where curbing is required it shall be granite curbing. Landscaped bio-retention areas should be
utilized when possible to minimize the need for closed drainage.
14.21 Dispersal of Runoff:
Where appropriate, roads should be designed to minimize collection and concentration of
roadway runoff.
a. Driveway runoff shall disperse and not add to runoff on adjoining roads.
b. Road grades should cause sheet flow to the down-gradient slope and into vegetated
buffers.
c. The clearing of existing roadside vegetation should not extend the full width of the rightof-
way, but rather permit existing vegetation to infiltrate and filter road runoff that arrives
as sheet flow. Clearing, grubbing and soil compaction should not be permitted beyond
what is necessary to create the road and its shoulder.
d. Concentration of stormwater should be carried in grass swales, and diverted to cross
culverts or dispersion trenches at ends of cut sections. In the case of fill sections, downhill
side ditches should be avoided if possible.
e. In more urban areas, concentrated stormwater should be diverted to bioretention areas to
filter and infiltrate at least the 1” storm. Flatter areas in the right-of-way shall be
reserved for this purpose. Such devices shall be placed as deemed necessary by the
Director of the Department of Public Works.
f. Road shoulders should contain sand/gravel, capped with several inches of topsoil and
seeded with a tough cover crop such as clover, to filter sediment and other pollutants
from runoff, and to prevent erosion of shoulders.
g. Runoff from sidewalks shall be diverted away from the road.
14.22 Pedestrian Walks, Sidewalks, and Bicycle Paths:
Where necessary in the judgment of the Planning Board, rights-of-way for pedestrian and/or
bicycle travel and access may be required between parts of the subdivision or between a
subdivision and public property. When such need has been created by the subdivision, the Board
may require the applicant to provide sidewalks and/or bicycle paths outside the subdivision, or to
pay some or all of the costs of such improvements. New street designs should reserve future
pedestrian and recreation corridors, sometimes separated from the main street.
14.23 Street Lighting:
The Planning Board may require the installation of street lighting in any subdivision where the
Board deems it necessary.
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 50
14.24 Naming of Streets:
No street shall have a name which will duplicate or closely duplicate the name of an existing
street. The continuation of an existing street shall have the same name. The names of streets shall
be determined and approved by the Town Communications Coordinator before approval of the
final plat.
14.25 Tree Plantings:
In subdivisions where appropriate to the nature and character of the land, the Planning Board may
require the planting of trees and/or shrubs within the street right-of-way. Such plantings shall be
indicated on the Final Plat.
14.26 Other Street Features:
a) All mailbox installations shall conform to the requirements of, and be approved by, the
United States Postal Service. Any proposed grouping of mailboxes, together with any
associated structures or any pull-off or other separate vehicular access, shall be shown on
the subdivision plans, and shall be subject to the approval of the Director of Public
Works. When an individual mailbox for each house is proposed, the mailbox shall be
located so that its face shall be a minimum of one foot from the edge of street pavement.
b) If on-street parking is planned, street width shall be as determined by the Director of
Public Works.

Connectivity Patterns
The road pattern north of the Main Street (wide street shown running left to right through the
middle) is not well connected and therefore is not preferred. The connectivity offered by the road
pattern south of the Main Street is preferred.

November 21, 2006 52
ARTICLE 15. UTILITIES, DRAINAGE, AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
15.01 Provision for Utilities and Drainage:
All subdivisions shall make adequate provision for water supply, storm water and sanitary sewage
disposal, and required utilities and improvements. The Board may require the extension of public
water and sewer to and within a proposed subdivision without cost to the Town, where, in the
sole judgment of the Board, existing lines are within a reasonable distance of the proposed
subdivision. Where a subdivision requires expenditures by the Town to improve existing utilities
to conform to minimum requirements, the Board may disapprove such subdivision as premature
in accordance with Article 11.03 until the Selectmen shall certify that funds for the utility
improvements have been assured by the municipality.
15.02 Avoidance of Flood Damage:
All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems shall be located,
elevated, and/or constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. All utilities and drainage
construction in subdivision shall conform to the flood plain protection requirements of the
Hanover Zoning Ordinance.
15.03 Installation of Utilities:
All utility system installation shall be at the expense of the subdivider and shall be installed under
the supervision of the Town Manager.
15.04 Installation of Laterals:
The subdivider shall install laterals from all utilities in the street right-of-way to 5 feet inside the
property line of each building lot within the subdivision.
15.05 Underground Placement of Utilities:
Unless otherwise approved by the Board, electric, telephone, cable television distribution, and
alarm systems shall be placed underground, including services to street lights. The subdivider
shall coordinate subdivision design with the utility companies to insure adequate and suitable area
for underground installations.
15.06 Storm Water Drainage System:
An adequate surface storm water drainage system for the entire subdivision area shall be provided
by the subdivider. Adequate draining shall be provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
The subdivider shall provide a suitably designed on-site drainage retention system wherever
possible. Otherwise, storm drainage shall be carried to existing watercourses or shall connect to
existing storm drains. If the storm water drainage system creates an additional flow over any
adjacent property, the subdivider shall hold the Town harmless from any claims for damage
resulting therefrom. For the purpose of preparing drainage plans, storm sewers and subdivision
drainage facilities shall be based on a ten-year storm design flow.
15.07 Sewage Disposal Design:
The design of sewage disposal systems for all subdivisions shall meet the requirements of Article
11.07.
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS TOWN OF HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
November 21, 2006 53
ARTICLE 16. SEDIMENT AND EROSION CONTROL
16.01 Purpose:
The purpose of this section is to control soil erosion and to prevent the resulting sedimentation
from occurring in subdivision areas by requiring proper provision for water disposal and
protection of soil surfaces during and after construction, in order to promote the public health,
safety, convenience, and general welfare of the community.
16.02 Standards:
The following standards shall be observed by the subdivider in the design, layout, and
engineering of the subdivision:
a. Stripping of vegetation, regrading, or other development shall be done in such a way that
will minimize on-site and off-site soil erosion.
b. Whenever practical, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and supplemented.
c. The disturbed area shall be kept to a minimum, and the duration of exposure shall be less
than a maximum of six months.
d. Temporary seeding and/or mulching shall be used to protect exposed critical areas during
development.
e. The subdivider shall make provision to accommodate the increased runoff caused by
changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.
f. The subdivider shall make reasonable effort to trap sediment in the runoff water until the
disturbed area is stabilized by the use of sediment basins or other acceptable methods.
g. Diversions, sediment basins, and other erosion control mechanisms shall be constructed
by the subdivider prior to any on-site grading or disturbance of existing surface material.

amounts as he deems to be in the best interest of the Town but on the condition that the
remaining security shall be sufficient to complete all remaining construction.
d. Release of Bond:
The Performance Bond shall be released when the Manager is satisfied that the
subdivider has complied with all requirements as set forth in the notice. The decision to
release the bond shall be based upon an assessment of the plans, the engineers’
preparatory work for construction, engineering inspection during construction, and the
final plans on completed work. The Manager shall notify the Board that all conditions of
the Bond have been performed and shall have the authority to release the bond unless,
after notification, the Board directs otherwise.
e. Enforcement of Bond:
If the subdivider has not totally complied within three years of the date of the recording

shall be set forth in writing and signed by the Chairman of the Board.
17.05 Inspection of Construction:
Prior to commencing construction, the subdivider shall pay to the Town an amount of money
estimated by the Manager to compensate fully the Town for all inspection and testing charges
deemed necessary. The subdivider shall notify the Manager in writing of the time when
construction is proposed to commence so that the Manager may cause inspection to be made to
insure that all Town specifications and requirements shall be met. It shall be the responsibility of
the subdivider to notify the town during the period of construction when inspection is to be made
in the same manner as an owner or contractor notifies the Code Enforcement Office under the
Town Building Code for inspection.
17.06 Certification of Compliance:
The subdivider shall notify the Board in writing when all requirements of the Final Plat have been
met. The subdivider’s engineer shall certify compliance with the notice including total
recertification to the extent necessary of any original installation, the guarantee, and damage
deficiencies.
17.07 Completion of Project:
The Town Manager or his agent shall examine the improvements installed by the subdivider and
compare them with the requirements imposed in the Notice of Action and with the specifications
contained in the Subdivision Regulations and other applicable Ordinances and Statutes. When the
Manager determines that the improvements have been completed in full, the subdivider is entitled
to a release of the Performance Bond unless there is a guarantee period to be covered.
17.08 Correction of Deficiencies:
If the Manager determines that any of the required improvements have not been completed in
accordance with the plans and specifications as filed by the subdivider and as required by the
Town, the Manager shall notify the subdivider in writing of any such deficiencies. The subdivider
shall rectify all deficiencies at the expense of the subdivider. If the subdivider does not
substantially rectify all deficiencies within a reasonable time as determined by the Town, the
Town shall take all necessary action to protect and preserve the Town's rights and interests
including suspension or revocation of Final Plat approval. In the event of legal action, the Town
shall be entitled to have reasonable attorney's fees paid by the subdivider and awarded by the

Bond covering maintenance of roads and improvements for a period of two years from
completion as may be required by the Town Manager in an amount based on the cost of such
improvements.
17.12 Erosion Control After Construction:
For a period of one year after completion of all improvements, the subdivider shall be responsible
for the control of soil erosion and any resulting sedimentation, in accordance with the
requirements of Article 16.
17.13 Subdivision As-Built Plans:
Following completion of all improvements, the subdivider shall submit an As-Built Plan. This
plan shall be drawn to scale and shall indicate by dimensions, angles and distances, as applicable,
the location of sewer and drain Y-branches, laterals, manholes, catch basins, hydrants, valves,
curb shut-offs, road profiles and center line elevations, and final grading plan showing swales and
ditches. The plan shall show easements, dedicated roadways, and roadbeds.
17.14 Monuments:
Permanent survey monuments shall be set in the boundary of rights-of-way at intersecting streets,
point of curvature, and point of tangency of curves; the point of intersection of short curves may
be used instead, where such is practical, at the discretion of the Manager. Monuments shall be
placed on one side of the street only and at only one corner of intersecting streets. Adjacent
monumented points shall be in sight of one another.
Monuments shall be referenced to a public street intersection, USGS benchmark or other
recognized existing monument. Monument locations and benchmark locations and elevations
shall be shown and dimensioned on the As-Built Plans.
Monuments shall be of stone, concrete, or other material acceptable to the Town Manger, and not
less than 4 inches in diameter or square, and not less than 42 inches long. Concrete monuments
shall be reinforced with steel rods. A plug, brass plate, or pin shall serve as the point of reference,

Residential Development, of the Zoning Ordinance. A lot shall be of sufficient size to meet
minimum zoning requirements for use, coverage, and area, and to provide such yards and other
open spaces as are herein required except as provided below. Such lot shall have frontage on an
improved public street, or other means of access approved by the Board of Adjustment, provided
that in no case of division or combination shall any residual lot or parcel be created which does
not meet the requirement of these Regulations. A lawful lot may be used for any use permitted or
allowed in the zoning district in which it is located as provided in this Ordinance or any

Lot-Based Subdivision:
A land use pattern common in the middle and latter part of the 20th century when subdivisions
were designed to assign all of the land of an existing lot to new house lots except that land which

area of the new subdivision road from the total acreage, dividing the remaining land into lots
meeting the minimum lot size and arraying those new lots along the road system so as to conform
to dimensional controls set forth in the Zoning Ordinance. In Hanover, lot-based subdivision is a
type of subdivision distinct from planned residential development, open space subdivision and
continuing care retirement community. Lot-based subdivision differs from what are known as

of the Town existing, laid out and established by law as public streets, and the location of the
exterior lines of parks as authorized by RSA 674:10.

The primary purpose of land designated as open space shall be to serve open space functions as
stated in the Hanover Master Plan and Subdivision Regulations. Open space is the area of a lot
with no buildings or other man-made improvements except those improvements which
specifically support the use of the open space, such as a path, fence or seating. The lands may be

used for agriculture, forestry and/or outdoor recreation.
The open space shall generally be unfragmented, contiguous and continuous, that is, not
interrupted by buildings, roads, driveways or other improvements which support development of
the site. Smaller, discrete areas of open space on the development parcel may be considered at
the sole discretion of the Planning Board when such areas serve the open space goals of the
Hanover Master Plan and when the small area contributes to the protection of natural features
which cross a property line or when such an area serves the open space needs of the residents of
the development.
Plat:
Shall mean Final Plat.
Preliminary Layout:
A plan of a proposed subdivision prepared as required in Article 5 of these Regulations and
submitted to the Board prior to preparation of the Final Plat.
