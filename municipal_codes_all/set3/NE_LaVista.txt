(3) Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of the zoning regulations, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property, the strict application of any zoning regulation would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional and undue hardships upon the owner of such property, to authorize, upon an appeal relating to the property, a variance from such strict application so as to relieve such difficulties or hardship, if such relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of any ordinance or resolution.

(E) In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.

§ 33.17 CLOSED SESSIONS.
(A) Any public body may hold a closed session by the affirmative vote of a majority of its voting members if a closed session is clearly necessary for the protection of the public interest or for the prevention of needless injury to the reputation of an individual and if such individual has not requested a public meeting. The subject matter and the reason necessitating the closed session shall be identified in the motion to close. Closed sessions may be held for but shall not be limited to such reasons as:
(1) (a) Strategy sessions with respect to collective bargaining, real estate purchases, pending litigation or litigation which is imminent as evidenced by communication of a claim or threat of litigation to or by the public body;
(b) Discussion regarding deployment of security personnel or devices;

If the motion to close passes, then the presiding officer immediately prior to the closed session shall restate on the record the limitation of the subject matter of the closed session. The public body holding such a closed session shall restrict its consideration to matters during the closed portions to only those purposes set forth in the motion to close as the reason for the closed session.

For purposes of this section, formal action shall mean a collective decision or a collective commitment or promise to make a decision on any question, motion, proposal, resolution, order, or ordinance or formation of a position or policy but shall not include negotiating guidance given by members of the public body to legal counsel or other negotiators in closed sessions authorized under subdivision (A)(1)(a).
(C) Any member of the public body shall have the right to challenge the continuation of a closed session if the member determines that the session has exceeded the reason stated in the original motion to hold a closed session or if the member contends that the closed session is neither clearly necessary for the protection of the public interest or the prevention of needless injury to the reputation of an individual. Such challenge shall be overruled only by a majority vote of the members of the public body. Such challenge and its disposition shall be recorded in the minutes.

The body may require any member of the public desiring to address the body to identify himself or herself.
(C) No public body shall, for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of the Open Meetings Act, hold a meeting in a place known by the body to be too small to accommodate the anticipated audience. No public body shall be deemed in violation of this section if it holds its meeting in its traditional meeting place which is located in this state.

Provided further, however, that the penalty amount on any bond shall not fall below the legal minimum, when one has been set by the State of Nebraska, for each particular official. All official bonds of the city officials shall be executed by the principal named in such bonds and by at least two sufficient sureties who shall be freeholders of the county, or by the official as principal and by a guaranty, surety, fidelity or bonding company, provided that no city official, while still in his of her official term of office, shall be accepted as surety on any other official's bond, contractor's bond, license bond or appeal bond under any circumstances. Only companies that are legally authorized to transact business in the State of Nebraska shall be eligible for suretyship on the bond of an official of the city. All said bonds shall obligate the principal and sureties for the faithful discharge of all duties required by law of such principal and shall inure to the benefit of the city and any persons who may be injured by a breach of the conditions of such bonds, in addition to incorporating any other requirements of applicable law. Notwithstanding anything in this code to the contrary, each bond shall be required to be filed no earlier than the date that the bond is required to be filed under applicable Nebraska statute, as enacted or amended from time to time. Bonds of City Council members shall be approved by the Mayor. Bonds of all other city officials shall be approved by the City Council. The approval of each official bond shall be endorsed upon such bond by the officer approving the same.

The premium on any official bond required to be given shall be paid out of the general fund or other proper city fund. All official bonds, meeting the conditions herein, shall be filed with the City Clerk for his of her official records, and it shall be the duty of the City Clerk to furnish a certified copy of any bond so filed upon the payment of a fee which shall be set by resolution of the City Council. In the event that the sureties on the official bond of any appointed officer of the city, in the opinion of the Mayor, with the approval of the City Council, become insufficient, the Mayor, with approval of the City Council, may fix a reasonable time within which the said officer may give a new bond or additional sureties as directed. In the event that the officer should fail, refuse or neglect to give a new bond or additional sureties to the satisfaction of the Mayor, then, with the approval of the City
2008 S-6
46 La Vista - Administration
Council, the office shall, by such failure, refusal or neglect, become vacant, and another officer shall be appointed to fill said office in accordance with applicable law. Any official who is re-elected or re-appointed to office shall be required to file a new bond after each election or appointment.
(B) In place of the individual bonds required to be furnished by city officers or officials, a schedule, position, blanket bond or undertaking, or evidence of equivalent insurance may be given by city officers or officials, or a single corporate surety fidelity, schedule, position, or blanket bond or undertaking, or evidence of insurance coverage covering all the officers and officials, including officers and officials required by law to furnish an individual bond or undertaking, may be furnished. The city shall pay the premium for the bond or insurance coverage.

In advertising for bids for any such work, or for the purchase of such equipment, the Council may publish the amount of such estimate therewith. Such advertisement shall be published at least seven days in some newspaper of general circulation published in the city; provided, that in the case of a public emergency resulting from infectious or contagious diseases, destructive windstorms, floods, snow, war or an exigency or pressing necessity or unforeseen need calling for immediate action or remedy to prevent a serious loss of or serious injury or damage to life, health or property, estimates of costs and advertising for bids may be waived in the emergency ordinance when adopted by a three-fourths vote of the Council and entered on record. If after advertising for bids as provided in this section, the City Council receives fewer than two bids on a contract for any work or improvement, or if the bids received by the city contain a price which exceeds the estimated cost of the project, the Mayor and City Council may negotiate a contract in an attempt to complete the proposed project at a cost commensurate with the estimate given.

not represent the Commission, the Commission may be represented by special counsel appointed by the Commission for such investigation. The investigation shall be based upon a review of the materials filed by the City Administrator and by the employee with the Secretary of the Civil Service Commission, and shall be confined to the determination of whether the disciplinary action was made in good faith for cause, which shall mean that the action was not arbitrary or capricious and was not made for political or religious reasons. The Commission and its members may also review the submissions of the City Administrator and of the employee to determine whether any individuals or documents should be subpoenaed by the Commission for the subsequent public hearing before the Commission.
(12) The Commission shall schedule a public hearing to be held after the investigation and no less than ten nor more than 20 calendar days from the date of filing of the employee's written demand for an investigation and public hearing.

(13) The City Administrator shall be permitted to appear in person and by counsel and to present the case of the city. The City Administrator may present evidence by testimony, documents, and other exhibits and shall be permitted to cross-examine the employee's witnesses. At the hearing, the employee shall be permitted to appear in person and by counsel and to present his or her defense. The employee may present evidence by testimony, documents, and other exhibits and shall be permitted to cross-examine the witnesses called by the city.
(14) The Commission may affirm the action taken by the City Administrator, if such action is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. If the Commission finds that the removal, suspension, demotion or discharge was made for political or religious reasons or was not made in good faith for cause, it shall order the immediate reinstatement or re-employment of the employee in the position or employment from which the employee was removed, suspended, demoted or discharged, which reinstatement shall, if the Commission in its discretion so provides, be retroactive and entitle such person to compensation and restoration of benefits and privileges from the time of such removal, suspension, demotion or discharge.
(15) Upon the hearing, in lieu of affirming the removal, suspension, demotion or discharge, the Commission may modify the order of removal, suspension, demotion or discharge by directing a suspension, with or without pay, for a given period and the subsequent restoration to duty or demotion in position or pay. No later than ten calendar days after the hearing, the Commission shall certify its findings in writing to the employee and to the City Administrator who shall enforce them.
(16) Appeals from the decision of the Civil Service Commission may be taken to the District Court in the manner provided by law.

The rate schedules and information submitted with the rate schedules shall be referred to as the rate filing. Any such rate filing shall be deemed filed upon receipt of the same by the City Clerk.

In order to prevent such obstructions, reasonable setback requirements are necessary. Accordingly, trees, bushes, and shrubs on any piece of ground or lot adjacent to the street right-of-way are permitted so long as (i) trees are planted and growing no closer than two feet to the lot line adjacent to the street right-of-way, regardless of whether there is a sidewalk abutting the lot or piece of ground, and (ii) said trees, bushes, and shrubs do not interfere with use of the street right-of-way or any public work, improvement, utility lines, or equipment on, in, over, across, or under the street right-of-way or any work thereon.

The owner or occupant of any lot or piece of ground adjacent to any street right-of-way over which there extends the branches or limbs of any tree, bush, or shrub (regardless whether or not it is planted in the street right-of-way or adjacent lot or ground) shall at all times keep said branches and limbs trimmed to the height of at least eight feet above the surface of the sidewalk and at least 15 feet above the surface
32 La Vista - General Regulations

(G) Exception; temporary obstructions; permit. Temporary obstruction of the street right-of-way is permitted for the erection, construction, reconstruction, wrecking, or repairing of any building or part thereof, or construction or repair of any pavement or utility within any street right-of-way, pursuant to and for the period of time allowed in a permit issued by the City Building Inspector. Any person desiring a permit under this division must submit a written application to the Building Inspector on forms provided by the city. Permits shall not be granted for more than obstruction of the sidewalk space and 1/3 of the roadway of the street right-of-way adjacent to the premises on which the building or pavement is to be constructed, erected, reconstructed, wrecked, or repaired or work performed. Permits shall be subject to the applicant maintaining a safe and suitable worksite and walkway within the street right-of-way, protected and lighted in the manner required by the Building Inspector. Any permit holder shall have the site, including but not limited to all excavations, work, equipment, and dangerous conditions, protected and guarded by suitable guards or barricades by day and barricades and warning lights at night; and the failure to do so shall result in the halting of work until compliance to the satisfaction of the Building Inspector and/or revocation of permit.

Mailboxes of other construction in the sidewalk space as of the permit date are permitted to remain so long as they are in conformity with applicable standards and specifications of the United States Postal Service, as revised from time to time, provided, however, that any such mailbox shall be replaced with a standard mailbox satisfying the requirements of the first sentence of this division (I) in the event the mailbox is removed, repaired, modified, or replaced or, in the determination of the City Building Inspector, is in need of replacement or substantial modification or repair.
(J) Exception; fences and retaining walls. Any fence or retaining wall, or any part thereof, installed or encroaching in, on, under, over, or across the street rights-of-way on or before the permit date shall be allowed to remain, if the owner of the lot or ground adjacent to the right-of-way files a written application with the City Building Inspector (on forms provided by the City) no later than December 31. 2003, and the Building Inspector issues a permit, provided, however, that, in the event that any such fence or retaining wall is removed, repaired, modified, or replaced or is in the
Public Ways and Property 33
determination of the Building Inspector in need of replacement or substantial modification or repair, it shall be moved, removed, or relocated so that it is no longer installed or encroaching in, on, under, over, or across the street right-of-way or any part thereof.

Public Ways and Property 35
(G) In all cases other than described in division (F) of this section, notice shall be given prior to removal of an obstruction from the street right-of-way.

Notices hereunder shall be given personally or by certified mail to each owner, or his or her duly authorized agent, and to the occupant, if any, of the lots or pieces of ground fronting on the portion of the street right-of-way on which the obstruction is located. In the event a property owner is not a resident of the county in which the lot or piece of ground is located, the notice shall be sent to the address listed on the tax rolls at the time the notice is first given.

If within 30 days after notice of removal in division (G) of this section is given, neither the owner nor the occupant complies with the order to abate and remove the obstruction (and in the case of dead or diseased trees, neither the owner nor the occupant requests a hearing), the City Building Inspector or his or her designee may do the work or have it done at the sole cost and expense of the persons placing the obstruction in the street right-of-way, or of the owners or occupants of the lots or pieces of ground fronting thereon. Any amount that is not paid shall be levied and assessed upon the lots or grounds specially benefitted from the work in the same manner as other special taxes for improvements are levied and assessed.

(F) Where more than one driveway approach on a street front serves a single parcel of land, there shall be at least one curb parking space between driveway approaches.
(G) Where the Building Inspector determines that a drainage culvert is needed under a driveway approach, any person constructing such a driveway approach shall install a drainage culvert meeting the dimensions and specifications specified by the City Council and City Engineer or Building Inspector.

The driveway approach shall contain curbs between the existing roadway curbs and the sidewalk edge nearest the roadway to prevent storm runoff from running behind the roadway curbs. It may be necessary to remove and replace existing sidewalk adjacent to the driveway approach to achieve such grades. Where existing grades make compliance with the above requirements impractical, the Building Inspector may allow deviations and will issue instructions on an alternative configuration.
(5) The driveway approach shall contain a thickened edge to match the thickness of the existing roadway pavement.
(6) The construction details and the above requirements are illustrated in the "Standard Driveway Approach Details" on file with the City Clerk, a copy of which may be obtained from the Building Inspector.

§ 95.29 IMPOUNDMENT OF CERTAIN ANIMALS DURING ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS.
(A) If there is reasonable cause shown that a domestic animal would constitute a hazard to the safety of the public at large during the pendency of any action or proceeding commenced under this chapter, or that the owner of such animal has subjected the animal to neglect or cruelty, the court may order such animal impounded pending the outcome of such proceedings. Any person who owns, kept, harbored, maintained, or controlled the animal involved in such impoundment shall pay all expenses of the impoundment to the animal control authority, including costs of shelter, food, veterinary expenses, boarding, and other expenses necessitated by the impoundment of the animal or as may be required for the protection of the public. The animal control authority may require such person, prior to expiration of ten days after the date of impoundment, to pay an amount sufficient to pay all reasonable expenses incurred in caring and providing for the animal, including estimated medical care, for thirty days, inclusive of the date on which the animal was impounded. If such payment is not made prior to expiration of such ten-day period, the animal shall become the property of the animal control authority and may be humanely disposed of, destroyed, or placed with a new owner, as the animal control authority deems appropriate. Such payment shad be required for each succeeding 30-day period. If any such payment is not made prior to the end of each succeeding 30-day period, the animal shall become the property of the animal control authority and may be humanely disposed of, destroyed, or placed with a new owner, as the animal control authority deems appropriate.
(B) The amount of the payment shall be determined by the animal control authority based on the current rate for board at the animal shelter and the condition of the animal after its examination by a veterinarian acting for the animal control authority. Any such payment received by the animal control authority in excess of the amount determined by the animal control authority to be due for the board and care of the animal shall be refunded by the animal control authority upon expiration of the order of impoundment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the owner of the animal is found not guilty of animal neglect or cruelty, the owner shall only be required to pay the veterinary expenses and one-half of the board and care fees determined by the animal control authority to be due.
(C) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is determined by a veterinarian acting for the animal control authority that such animal is diseased or disabled, that it would be inhumane to allow such animal to continue to suffer the effects of such disease or disability, and that the owner of such animal declines to

(Ord. 921, passed 12-2-03)
§ 117.02 STRATEGY.
The Mayor and City Council find and determine as follows: Community and economic development is essential to the vitality, strength and economic well being of the city. There is a high degree of
81
2004 S-2
82 La Vista - Business Regulations
competition among states and municipalities to provide incentives for businesses or services to locate or expand in or near their respective jurisdictions. The community and economic development strategy of the city is to be positioned to quickly and effectively compete for quality community or economic development opportunities. The strategy further includes lowering the property tax burden by the expansion of the property and sales tax bases through public investment in the local economy as a result of the Economic Development Program.
(Ord. 921, passed 12-2-03)
§ 117.03 PURPOSE.
The purpose of this Economic Development Program is to give the city the flexibility to quickly respond to desirable opportunities for community or economic development using funds raised from local sources of revenue to provide incentives or investment in the La Vista community or its infrastructure for the location or expansion of services or businesses or rehabilitation of residential neighborhoods in or near the city. The intent and goals of the city in establishing an economic development program are to ultimately increase the overall community tax valuation, create jobs and generate employment opportunities within the La Vista area, attract new investment capital to the community, develop tourism opportunities, broaden the tax base, support or capitalize on La Vista's existing or future commercial developments, rehabilitate residential neighborhoods, expand industrial development and/or increase economic diversification, stability and vitality for the City of La Vista and the surrounding area.
(Ord. 921, passed 12-2-03)
§ 117.04 DURATION.
The Economic Development Program established by this chapter shall be in existence for a period of 25 years beginning on October 1, 2004 and ending on September 30, 2029. Before October 1, 2004, the Mayor and City Council, Plan Administrator and/or committees created under this chapter shall be authorized to plan and prepare for economic development opportunities and activities, so long as any economic development incentive, assistance, appropriation or funds raised from local sources of revenue does not commence earlier than October 1, 2004. Revenue to fund this Economic Development Program shall be established annually during the Program by the Mayor and City Council as part of the city operating budget and the amount appropriated in any year will not exceed the applicable statutory limitations described elsewhere below. The Mayor and City Council may allocate such funds from the existing 1% local option sales tax or property taxes. The Mayor and City Council shall have authority to extend the program beyond September 30, 2029 for one or more years as they determine in their sole discretion advisable to appropriate any unexpended funds that were collected from local sources of revenue and deposited in the Economic Development Fund before October 1, 2029 or earnings thereon.

(Ord. 921, passed 12-2-03)
§ 117.18 ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM.

Such facilities shall include, but not be limited to, all mains, services, pipes, conduits and appliances necessary or convenient for transmitting, transporting, distributing and supplying natural gas for all purposes for which it may be used, and to do all other things necessary and proper in providing natural gas service to the inhabitants of city and in carrying on such business. The laying or installation of additional pipe within the city and its extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction shall require a right-of-way permit for that purpose.
(Ord. 974, passed 12-6-05)
§ 118.02 TERM.
The franchise granted under this chapter shall remain in effect for a period of 25 years from the effective date of this chapter, as determined pursuant to state law; provided, however, that city or grantee may terminate this chapter on the tenth anniversary of the effective date of this chapter, and every five years thereafter until the franchise term expires. City or grantee shall notify the other party in writing, no later than 180 days before the end of the initial term or each five-year anniversary thereafter that city desires not to renew the franchise.
(Ord. 974, passed 12-6-05)
§ 118.03 GOVERNING RULES AND REGULATIONS.
(A) The franchise granted under this chapter is subject to all conditions, limitations and immunities now provided for, or as hereafter amended, and applicable to the operations of a public utility, by state or federal law. The rates to be charged by grantee for service within the present or future corporate limits of city and the rules and regulations regarding the character, quality and standards of service to be furnished by grantee shall be under the jurisdiction and control of such regulatory body or bodies as may, from time to time, be vested by law with authority and jurisdiction over the rates, regulations and quality and standards of service to be supplied by grantee. Provided however, should any judicial, regulatory or legislative body, having proper jurisdiction, take any action that precludes grantee from recovering from its customers any cost associated with services provided hereunder, then grantee and city shall renegotiate the terms of this chapter in accordance with the action taken, so as to allow grantee to be made whole economically.
(B) In determining the rights and duties of the grantee, the terms of this chapter shall take precedence over any conflicting terms or requirements contained in any other ordinance enacted by the city. The foregoing notwithstanding, grantee shall be and remain subject to all ordinances, rules, and regulations of the city now in effect, or which city might subsequently adopt, for the regulation of land

uses or the protection of the health, safety, and general welfare of the public; provided, however, that grantee hereby reserves the right to challenge the validity of any ordinance, rule or regulation city passes subsequent to the date of this chapter, and to terminate this chapter upon 90 days advance written notification, if such subsequent ordinance, rule or regulation imposes any material new costs and/or burdens upon the grantee, and provided that nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver by grantee of any of its existing or future rights under state or federal law or a limitation upon the existing or future powers of the city under state or federal law.
(C) If an energy supplier is unable to furnish an adequate supply of energy due to an emergency, an order or decision of a public regulatory body, or other acts beyond the control of the grantee, then the grantee shall have the right and authority to adopt reasonable rules and regulations limiting, curtailing or allocating extensions of service or supply of energy to any customers or prospective customers, and withholding the supply of energy to new customers, provided that such rules and regulations shall be uniform as applied to each class of customers or prospective customers, and shall be non-discriminatory as between communities receiving service from the grantee.
(Ord. 974, passed 12-6-05)
§ 118.04 LOCATION, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF COMPANY FACILITIES.
(A) All mains, services and pipes which shall be hereafter laid or installed under this chapter shall be located in public right-of-way and shall be located and laid so as not to obstruct or interfere with any existing or planned water pipes, drains, sewers, paving or other structures, and all such mains, services and pipes shall be laid in place subject to the reasonable approval of the city or subject to the reasonable approval of such representative as city may from time to time provide. Any pavements, sidewalks or curbing taken up and any and all excavations made shall be done in such a manner as to cause only such inconvenience to the inhabitants of city and to the general public as is reasonably necessary; and repairs and replacements shall be made promptly by grantee, leaving such properties in as good as condition as existed immediately prior to excavation. If grantee does not promptly perform and complete the necessary work to restore the public right-of-way of other public property, and fails to properly restore the public right-of-way within 30 days after receipt of written notice by the city to grantee of the condition, then the city may restore the public right-of-way or other public property. The city may seek reimbursement from grantee for the reasonable expense of restoration for the work performed by the city or its agents.
(B) Grantee agrees that for the term of this grant, it will maintain facilities and equipment sufficient to meet the current and future energy requirements of city, its inhabitants and industries. While constructing and maintaining its facilities and equipment, grantee shall obtain permits as required by ordinance, except that in emergency situations, grantee shall take immediate unilateral actions as it determines are necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare; in which case, grantee shall notify city as soon as reasonably possible.
2007 S-4
100 La Vista - Business Regulations
(C) City will give grantee reasonable notice of plans for street improvements where paving or resurfacing of a permanent nature is involved that affect grantee's facilities. The notice shall contain the nature and character of the improvements, the rights-of-way upon which the improvements are to be made, the extent of the improvements and the time when the city will start the work, and, if more than one right-of-way is involved, the order in which this work is to proceed.

If city orders or requests grantee to relocate its facilities or equipment for the primary benefit of a commercial or private project, or as a result of the initial request of a commercial or private developer or other non-public entity, and such removal is necessary to prevent interference and not merely for the convenience of the city or other right-of-way user, grantee shall receive payment for the cost of such relocation as a precondition to relocating its facilities or equipment. City shall consider reasonable alternatives in designing its public works projects so as not arbitrarily to cause grantee unreasonable additional expense in exercising its authority under this section. City shall also provide a reasonable alternative location for grantee's facilities. City shall give grantee written notice of vacating of a public right-of-way. Vacating of a public right-of-way shall not deprive the grantee of its right to operate and maintain existing facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the same are first paid to the grantee.

(B) In addition to and not in limitation of the foregoing, grantee shall be insured to provide coverage for all foreseeable and unforeseeable risks, injuries and damages, on account of or arising from this chapter and such coverage shall include, but not be limited to the following types:
2007 S-4
102 La Vista - Business Regulations

It is a condition of this chapter that all policies waive governmental immunity as a defense in any action brought against the insured or any other party to this chapter. Upon request by city, grantee shall furnish proof of the insurance required under this section.

§ 118.10 ACCEPTANCE OF FRANCHISE.
Within 60 days after the passage of this chapter, grantee shall prepare and file a written acceptance of the franchise granted under this chapter with the City Clerk. Failure of grantee to so accept the franchise granted by this chapter within said period of time shall be deemed a rejection thereof by grantee and the rights and privileges herein granted shall after the expiration of said period of 60 days, if not so accepted, absolutely cease and terminate, unless said period of time shall be extended by further ordinance duly passed for that purpose.
(Ord. 974, passed 12-6-05)

(A) Grantee shall pay to the City Treasurer a franchise fee based on a percentage of grantee's gross revenues derived from sales or transportation of natural gas delivered within the city excluding sales or transportation to governmental agencies, departments, or other governmental bodies whether they be federal, state or local. The franchise fee shall be 5% of gross revenues but may be amended by city from time to time to provide for such different rate as city's governing body may determine appropriate. Such franchise fee shall be in lieu of any and all fees and impositions of city based on gross revenues or license fees for the privilege of conducting a gas business within the city. Nothing herein shall be construed to exempt grantee from payment of ad valorem property taxes or taxes in lieu thereof.
(B) Grantee shall pay to the city on or before the 15th day of each month that portion of the fee applicable to gross receipts derived from sales or transportation of natural gas delivered within the city during the previous month.

§ 135.01 FINDINGS AND INTENT.
(A) The Nebraska Legislature has found that certain sex offenders who have committed offenses against children present a high risk to commit repeat offenses against children, has recognized the interest and authority of cities to restrict such persons' place of residency, and has defined statewide parameters for such restrictions in the Nebraska Sexual Predator Residency Restriction Act.

Where there is a high risk to repeat such acts, such persons are extremely likely to pose a great threat to children. The cost of sex offender victimization to society is very high.
(C) It is the intent of this chapter to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city, and particularly its children, by creating certain areas in and around places where children regularly congregate where certain sexual predators cannot reside.

RENTAL INSPECTION PROGRAM
§ 150.60 ESTABLISHMENT OF RENTAL INSPECTION PROGRAM.
A rental inspection program is hereby established for the City of La Vista, Nebraska pursuant to authority granted by Nebraska law, as adopted or amended from time to time, including, but not limited to, Neb. RS 16-246.
(Ord. 1095, passed 10-20-09)
§ 150.61 FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND INTENT OF THE RENTAL INSPECTION PROGRAM.
(A) The Mayor and City Council make the following findings:
(1) Much of the original housing of the city is approaching 50 years of age. As housing ages, there is an increasing need for regular monitoring and action to maintain it and keep the city's neighborhoods in good, safe and sanitary condition and repair.
(2) A significant portion of the original housing and neighborhoods of the city have transitioned from owner occupied to rental homes, making consistent monitoring and necessary maintenance more difficult.
(3) Transition to rental properties can be a significant factor contributing to the risk of deteriorating conditions of original housing and neighborhoods of the city.
(4) Multi-unit residential apartment complexes have been constructed in and around the city in recent years.
(5) Failure to properly maintain multi-unit apartment complexes places multiple tenants at risk.
(6) In cases of both single family and multi-unit residential housing, failure to properly maintain can have a deleterious affect and be a significant contributing factor to the decline of entire neighborhoods.
(7) Tenants of rental housing can face landlord resistance to needed maintenance or repairs; and tenants might be reluctant to report deficiencies to landlords.
(8) A program that encourages regular maintenance and repair of rental dwellings is in the public interest, good for tenants and neighborhoods in which such properties are located, and in the interests of all residents of the city to keep them in safe, sanitary, and properly maintained condition.
Livable housing and neighborhoods also sustain the city's property tax base.
2009 S-7
Building Regulations 16A
(B) Based on the foregoing, the Mayor and City Council have determined that it is necessary, desirable, appropriate and in the public interest to implement a uniform rental housing licensing and inspection program. The purpose of this rental inspection program is to provide for licensing and inspection of rental dwellings to promote compliance with the International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC) and other applicable laws, and to require property owners of rental dwellings, including single-family rental dwellings, to obtain licenses for the occupancy of rental dwellings. The intent of this rental inspection program includes:
(1) Promoting the health, safety, and welfare of the persons living in and near rental dwellings;
(2) Preserving of the existing housing supply and neighborhoods;
(3) Helping to maintain property values and the city's tax base;
(4) Working toward preventing or eliminating substandard and deteriorating rental housing; and
(5) Maintaining a living environment that contributes to healthful individual and family living.

(A) (1) Upon receipt of a properly completed application and payment of the applicable fees and other amounts for a rental license, the Building Official shall schedule and notify the property owner of a primary inspection of the property as soon as is practicable after review of the license application. At least ten days advance written notice of the inspection shall be provided to the property owner and tenant in accordance with applicable law. If either the owner or tenant of a rental dwelling refuses to consent to an inspection, the Building Official shall obtain a warrant for the inspection in accordance with applicable taw, including, but not limited to, Neb. RS 29-830 et seq.
(2) The primary inspection will be conducted to determine if the rental dwelling satisfies all applicable requirements of the IPMC and other building-related codes or ordinances adopted or amended from time to time by the city for the health, safety, and welfare of the persons living in and near rental dwellings. The Building Official shall be authorized to take such actions as the Building Official determines necessary or appropriate to implement, administer and carry out the inspection requirements of this subchapter, including, but not limited to, scheduling inspections for the efficient use of city resources.
(3) Newly constructed rental dwellings. Provided the required application and fees and other amounts are filed and paid as required, a certificate of occupancy issued by the Building Official for any rental dwelling completed after the effective date of this subchapter shall also satisfy the initial inspection requirement for a rental license. If filing of the application or payment of the fee is delayed, the rental dwelling shall be subject to such application, licensing, inspection and fee requirements as applicable to any other rental dwelling before a rental license is issued.

(C) When the primary inspection of a rental dwelling reveals any violation of applicable requirements, a notice shall be provided to the property owner as specified in Section 107 of the IPMC. The notice shall contain a time frame set by the Building Official necessary to correct the violations based on the number and severity of the violations. Correction of minor code violations noted shall be deemed to be a condition of the license that is issued or renewed immediately following the inspection during which the violations were noted. If a minor code violation noted in a primary inspection exists upon re-inspection two years later, follow-up inspection shall be required to confirm that all outstanding violations have been corrected before licensing is issued. Major code violations shall be corrected to the satisfaction of the Building Official upon re-inspection before any license is issued or renewed.
(D) A follow-up inspection of any major violation will be conducted at the end of the time frame set by the Building Official to correct the violations before a license is issued or renewed. If the Building Official finds that any such violation has not been corrected, the license or license renewal shall be denied. A major code violation after a license has been issued or renewed shall be subject to such enforcement action as determined necessary or advisable in accordance with applicable law, up to and including revocation of the license, order vacating the premises and assessment of fines and penalties.
(E) Inspection fees. The primary inspection shall be conducted at no charge. Inspection of a Class B property after the primary inspection also shall be conducted at no charge if violations have been corrected. If any violation has not been corrected, a fee shall be charged for inspections after the primary inspection in accordance with the master fee ordinance, which fee shall be due and payable before a license for said property is issued or renewed.

Section 4.09 Yard Requirements.
4.09.01 Yard requirements shall be set forth under the Schedule of Lot, Yard, and Bulk Requirements for each zoning district.

4.09.03 The City may permit a variation in front yard setbacks to allow new or relocated structures to conform to the average existing setback provided that 1) More than thirty (30) percent of the frontage on one side of a street between intersecting streets is occupied by structures on the effective date of this Ordinance, and 2) A minority of such structures have observed or conformed to an average setback line.
Section 4.10 Through Lots.
4.10.01 Through Lots shall follow the following criteria:
4.10.01.01 Where a Through Lot abuts a major thoroughfare, such as 84th Street, Giles Road, Harrison Street, etc., and access is made from the other frontage street and access along said thoroughfare is restricted, the Rear Yard setback for fences and screening devices shall be zero (0) feet. The Rear Yard setback for accessory buildings shall follow the prescribed setback within the zoning district.
4.10.01.02 Where a Through Lot is part of a triple frontage lot and abuts a major thoroughfare, the Rear Yard shall meet the standards of 4.10.01.01, while the other two frontages shall be treated as a Corner Lot with a Front Yard setback and a Street Side Yard setback.
4.10.01.03 Where a Through Lot occurs, other than along a major thoroughfare, the following shall apply:
1. Where all principal structures in the development face the same frontage, then the Rear Yard setback for fences and screening shall be zero (0) feet and all accessory buildings shall meet the prescribed setback within the zoning district. This shall apply similarly at triple frontage lots, provided the remaining two frontages are treated like a typical Corner Lot.
2. Where principal structures face different directions along both frontages, the Rear Yard setback for fences and screening shall be the same as any prescribed Rear Yard setback within the zoning district. This shall apply similarly at triple frontage lots, provided the remaining two frontages are treated like a typical Corner Lot. All accessory buildings in this condition, shall comply with the minimum Rear Yard setbacks rather than the reduced setback allowed for accessory buildings.
Section 4.11 Drainage. No building, structure, or use shall be erected on any land, and no change shall be made in the existing contours of any land, including any change in the course, width, or elevation of any natural or other drainage channel, that will obstruct, interfere with, or substantially change the drainage from such land to the detriment of neighboring lands. Anyone desiring to build or otherwise change the existing drainage situation shall be responsible for providing to the City or their designated agent with data indicating that such changes will not be a detriment to the neighboring lands.
Section 4.12 Permitted Obstructions in Required Yards. The following shall not be considered to be obstructions when located in the required yards:

4.19.02 Enlargement, Repair, Alterations: Any such structure described in Section 4.19.01 may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or remodeled, provided, however, that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair or remodeling shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase

In permitting such change, the Planning Commission and/or City Council may require appropriate conditions and safeguard in accord with the provisions of this ordinance;
4.20.02.04 Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in any or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed;

Section 5.15 PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (Overlay District)
5.15.01 Intent: The intent of the PUD District is to encourage creative design in buildings, open space, and their inter-relationship while protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of existing and future residents of surrounding neighborhoods.
The PUD District is an overlay zone. Although the specific conditions within this district are predetermined, the location of a proposed district must be carefully reviewed to assure that these conditions can be met. A specific PUD site plan shall be submitted by each applicant for “PUD” zoning in accordance with the provisions and conditions that follow.
5.15.02 Recommendation, findings of fact and development sizes
The planning commission, in its minutes, shall set forth its reasons for recommendation of approval or denial of the application for a PUD District, along with specific evidence and facts showing that the proposal meets or does not meet the following conditions.
5.15.02.01 Said planned unit development shall be in general conformity with the provisions of the La Vista Comprehensive Plan.
5.15.02.02 Said planned unit development shall not have a substantially adverse effect on the development of the neighboring area.
5.15.02.03 The minimum size allowed for a PUD District shall be 3 acres.
5.15.02.04 Permitted uses, lot sizes, height limits, bulk, density, parking, and setback requirements may be varied so as to promote an efficient and creative PUD District.
5.15.03 Use regulations.
All uses in the underlying zoning district may be permitted or conditionally permitted, unless certain uses are limited by City Council. Additionally, other uses (outside the underlying zoning district) may be allowed by City Council to promote mixed-use development.
5.15.04 Standards and conditions for development.
A planned unit development shall be consistent with the following general standards for use of land, and the use, type, bulk, and location of buildings, the density or intensity of use, open space, and public facilities.
5.15.04.01 The applicant shall submit a schedule of construction. The proposed construction shall begin within a period of twelve (12) months following the approval of the application by the City Council. A minimum of fifty (50) percent of the total planned construction shown on the final plan shall be completed within a period of five (5) years following such approval or the PUD plan shall expire. The period of time established for the completion of the development may be modified from time to time by the City Council upon review and recommendation by the Planning Commission upon the showing of good cause by the developer.
5.15.04.02 The developer shall provide and record easements and covenants, shall make such other arrangements, and shall furnish such performance bonds, escrow deposit, or other financial guarantees for public improvements as may be determined by the City Council to be reasonably required to assure performance in accordance with the development plan and to protect the public interest in the event of abandonment of said plan before completion.
5.15.04.03 The site shall be accessible from public roads and/or private roads that are adequate to carry the traffic that will be imposed upon them by the proposed development. The streets and driveways on the site of the proposed development shall be adequate to serve the residents or occupants of the proposed development.

Section 5.17 GATEWAY CORRIDOR DISTRICT (OVERLAY DISTRICT)
5.17.01 Intent:
The City of La Vista has established basic site and building development criteria to be implemented within the boundaries of this overlay district for all multi-family, industrial, and commercial building projects. The Gateway Corridor District has been established in order to implement the policies developed in the Future Land Use Plan portion of the Comprehensive Development Plan. These criteria include, but are not limited to the following: landscaping, building material selection, lighting, and interior street development. The purpose for regulating these issues is to provide for cohesive and properly developed entrances into the City corridor. Guiding development in this manner promotes the general health, safety and welfare of the residents within the zoning jurisdiction of the City, by providing quality design and construction which will also aid in the protection of past and future investment in the corridor. (Ordinance No. 1172, 3-20-12)
Within the Gateway Corridor Overlay District there is a sub-area secondary overlay centered on the intersection of 96th and Giles Road (see Official Zoning map). The purpose of this secondary overlay evolves around a partnership between the City of La Vista and Metropolitan Community College which have made a significant investment in the community with the new La Vista Public Library / MCC Sarpy Center. The City's desire is that this district be the standard of quality for all multi-family, industrial, and commercial building projects within this geographically defined area. See Section 5.17.06 for special design criteria for this sub-area. (Ordinance No. 1048, 10-2-07)
5.17.02 Purpose:
The purpose of these criteria is to establish a checklist of those items that affect the physical aspect of La Vista's environment. Pertinent to appearance is the design of the site, building and structures, planting, signs, street hardware, and miscellaneous other objects that are observed by the public.
The criteria contained herein are not intended to restrict imagination, innovation or variety, but rather to assist in focusing on design principles that can result in creative solutions that will develop a satisfactory visual appearance within the city, preserve taxable values, and promote the public health, safety and welfare.
5.17.03 Geographic Area:
For a geographically defined area of the Gateway Corridor Overlay District, see the Official Zoning Map. If a site is partially covered by said overlay district, then the entire site is to be covered by these regulations. (Ordinance No. 1048, 10-2-07) (Ordinance No. 1172, 3-20-12)
The sub-area secondary overlay -area occurs within all developments that front on the 96th Street and Giles Road corridors including:
? Giles Road Corridor – from 90th Street to 108th Street.
? 96th Street Corridor – from Harrison Street to Portal Road
If a site is partially covered by said sub-area secondary overlay district, then the entire portion of the site facing 96th and/or Giles Road is to be covered by these regulations. See Section 5.17.06 for special design criteria for this geographic area. For a geographically defined area, see the Official Zoning Map. (Ordinance No. 1048, 10-2-07)

Section 5.18 FF/FW Flood Plain Districts (Overlay District)
5.18.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
The Legislature of the State of Nebraska has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. The Legislature, in Sections 31-1001 to 31-1022, R.R.S. 1943 (as amended), has further assigned the responsibility to adopt, administer, and enforce floodplain management regulations to the county, city or village with zoning jurisdiction over the flood-prone area. Therefore, the City Council of the City of LaVista, Nebraska, ordains as follows:
5.18.02 FINDINGS OF FACT
5.18.02.01 Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation
The flood hazard areas of the City of La Vista, Nebraska, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditure for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
5.18.02.02 General Causes of Flood Losses
Flood Losses are caused by: (1) The cumulative effect of obstruction in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and (2) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others, which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages.
5.18.02.03 Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards
These regulations use a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps:
1. Selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for these regulations is representative of large floods which are reasonable characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to these regulations. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one (1) year, as delineated in the official Flood Insurance Study and illustrative materials dated May 3, 2010, and as may be amended.
2. Calculations of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and over-bank areas to convey the base flood.
3. Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point.
4. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the floodway profile.
5. Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e. that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood.
LA VISTA, NEBRASKA - ZONING ORDINANCE - 2001
75
5.18.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in Section 5.18.02.01by applying the provisions of these regulations for the following purposes.
5.18.03.01 Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities.
5.18.03.02 Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction.
5.18.03.03 Protect individuals from buying lands which are not suitable for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
5.18.03.04 Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance.
5.18.04 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY
This ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of LaVista, Nebraska that are subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year, now or in the future, as identified as numbered and unnumbered A Zones (including AE, AO and AH Zones) on the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (effective FIRM) dated May 3, 2010, or best available data as determined by more recent hydrologic and hydraulic studies completed or approved by the City or other government agency. Requirements established in Section 5.18.16 of this ordinance shall apply to the Zoning Districts FW and FF based on the most restrictive information available. In all areas covered by this ordinance no development shall be permitted except upon the issuance of a floodplain permit to develop, granted by the City Council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the City Council or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community and where specifically noted in Sections 5.18.17, 5.18.18, and 5.18.19.
5.18.05 ENFORCEMENT OFFICER
The Chief Building Official is hereby designated as the Enforcement Officer for the City of La Vista, Nebraska, under these regulations.
5.18.06 RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
The boundaries of the floodway and flood fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map, the Flood Insurance Rate Map or Floodway Map, or on the Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map. Where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the Enforcement Officer shall make the necessary interpretation. In such cases where the interpretation is contested, the Board of Adjustment will resolve the dispute. The regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the flood fringe overlay district boundary on the land. The location of the floodway overlay district boundary may be based on a map completed or approved by the City or other government agency, provided the boundary is not less restrictive than that shown on the effective FIRM. The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board of Adjustment and to submit his own technical evidence, if he so desires.
The boundaries of the FF/FW Flood Plain Districts (Overlay District) shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, or the Floodway Map. Where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the Building Inspector shall make the necessary interpretation. In such cases where the interpretation is contested, the Board of Adjustment will resolve the dispute. The regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land. The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his/her case to the Board of Adjustment and to submit his/her own technical evidence, if he/she so desires.

5.18.08 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
It is not intended by this ordinance to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where these regulations impose greater restrictions, the provisions of these regulations shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with these regulations are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
5.18.09 INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these regulations shall be held to minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State Statute.
5.18.10 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. These regulations do not imply that areas outside the boundaries of the FF/FW Flood Plain Districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the City of La Vista, Nebraska, of any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
5.18.11 SEVERABILITY
If any section, clause, provision or portion of these regulations is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of these regulations shall not be affected thereby.
5.18.12 APPLICATION FOR APPEAL
Where a request for a permit to develop is denied by the Chief Building Official, the applicant may apply for such permit or variance directly to the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment may grant or deny such request in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance governing the Board of Adjustment.
5.18.13 PERMITS REQUIRED
No person, firm or corporation shall initiate any floodplain development or substantial improvement or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a separate permit for development as defined by these regulations.
5.18.14 ADMINISTRATION
The Chief Building Official is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of these regulations. The duties of the Chief Building Official shall include, but not be limited to the following:

5.18.18 FLOOD FRINGE OVERLAY DISTRICT (INCLUDING AO AND AH ZONES)
5.18.18.01 Permitted Uses
Any use permitted in Section 5.18.19 shall be permitted in the Flood Fringe Overlay District. No use shall be permitted in the district unless the standards of Section 5.18.17 are met.
5.18.18.02 Standards for the Flood Fringe Overlay District
1. Require that new construction or substantial improvements of residential structures to have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above one (1) foot above the highest base flood elevation available, now or in the future.
2. Require new construction or substantial improvements of non-residential structures to have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above one (1) foot above the base flood elevation available, now or in the future, or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, to be flood-proofed so that below that level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Chief Building Official as set forth in Section 5.18.14.07.
3. Require for all new construction and substantial improvements that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The area below lowest floor subject to flooding shall be a maximum of four (4) feet in height measured from the bottom of the floor joists, unless used for parking of vehicles. Areas other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be not higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
4. All electrical equipment and sanitary facilities, including circuits, installed electric appliances, toilets, sinks, drains, in new developments and substantial improvements shall be located so as to not be subject to flooding or shall be floodproofed to prevent damage resulting from flood levels exceeding the highest base flood elevation available, now or in the future, by one foot. Backflow valves should be installed on all septic lines leading from the structure.
5. Within AH Zones adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be required in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

6. All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Manufactured homes must be anchored in accordance with local building codes or FEMA guidelines. In the event that over-the-top frame ties to ground anchors are used, the following specific requirements (or their equivalent) shall be met:
(a) Over-the-top ties be provided at each of the four (4) corners of the manufactured home with two (2) additional ties per side at intermediate locations. Manufactured homes less than fifty (50) feet long require one (1) additional tie per side.
(b) Frame ties be provided at each corner of the home with five (5) additional ties per side at intermediate points. Manufactured homes less than fifty (50) feet long require four (4) additional ties per side.
(c) All components of the anchoring system be capable of carrying a force of forty-eight hundred (4800) pounds.
(d) Any additions to manufactured homes be similarly anchored.
7. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within special flood hazard areas on the FIRM on sites outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, or in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above one (1) foot above the base flood elevation; and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.18.18.02 (5) above.
8. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within the special flood hazard areas on the community's official map shall either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (ii) meet the permit requirements and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" of this ordinance. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
9. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 5.18.04 are areas designated as AO Zones. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply within AO Zones:
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as one (1) foot above the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified).
(b) All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall (i) have the lowest floor elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as one (1) foot above the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified), or (ii) together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely flood-proofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Such certification shall be provided to the Building Inspector as set forth in Section 5.18.14.07.
(c) Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be required in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
5. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
6. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
LA VISTA, NEBRASKA - ZONING ORDINANCE - 2001
82
7. The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and Flood Plain Management Program for that area;
8. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
9. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
10. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, and streets and bridges.
5.18.21 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES
5.18.21.01 Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size if contiguous to or surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the requirements of Sections 5.18.21.02 through 5.18.21.05 below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
5.18.21.02 Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels along the floodway profile during the base flood discharge would result.
5.18.21.03 Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
5.18.21.04 Variances shall only be issued upon:
1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
5.18.21.05 Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given a written notice from the Building Inspector that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one-hundred dollars ($100) of insurance coverage, and that such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by these regulations.
5.18.22 NONCONFORMING USE
5.18.22.01 A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or amendment of flood plain regulations, but which is not in conformity with the provisions of these regulations may be continued subject to the following conditions:
1. No such structure of use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity.
2. If such use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, any future use of the building premises shall conform to this ordinance.
3. Uses or adjuncts thereof, which are or become nuisances, shall not be entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
LA VISTA, NEBRASKA - ZONING ORDINANCE - 2001
83
5.18.22.02 If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred except that if it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of these regulations. This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations.
5.18.23 PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION
Violation of the provisions of these regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500), and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of La Vista, Nebraska, or other appropriate authority from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
5.18.24 AMENDMENTS
The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries set forth in these regulations may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, or appealed to reflect any and all changes in the National Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, provided, however, that no such action shall be taken until after a public hearing in relation thereto, at which interested parties and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of La Vista, Nebraska. At least ten (10) days shall elapse between the date of this publication and the public hearing. A copy of such amendments will be provided to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulations of this ordinance are in compliance with the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations as published in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations and the 1983 Nebraska Flood Plain Management Act.
5.18.25 DEFINITIONS
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage and so as to give this ordinance its most reasonable application.
“Appeal” – A request for a review of the Chief Building Official’s interpretation of any provision of this ordinance or a request for a variance.
“Area of Shallow Flooding” – A designated AO or AH Zone on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
“Area of Special Flood Hazard” – The land in the flood plain within a community subject to one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
“Base Flood” – The flood having one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
“Basement” – Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
“Best Available Data” – means any hydrologic and hydraulic studies which result in a base flood elevation, now or in the future, that is higher than that shown on the Effective FIRM or Effective FIS. Such study must be completed or approved by the Village/City/County or other government agency.
“Development” – Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials.
LA VISTA, NEBRASKA - ZONING ORDINANCE - 2001
84
“Existing Construction” (for the purpose of determining rates) – Structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRM’s effective before that date. “Existing Construction” may also be referred to as “existing structures.”
“Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision” – A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is complete before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
“Expansion to an Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision” – The preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and wither final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads.)
“Flood or Flooding” – A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
(1) the overflow of inland waters; or
(2) the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.
“Flood Fringe” – That area of the floodplain, outside of the floodway, that on the average is likely to be flooded once every one-hundred (100) years, i.e. that has a one percent (1%) chance of flood occurrence in any one year.
“Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” of “Effective FIRM” – An official map of a community, on which the Flood Insurance Study has delineated the Flood Hazard Boundaries and the zones establishing insurance rates applicable to the community.
“Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” or “Effective FIS” – The official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the Flood Boundary Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
“Floodplain” – Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of “flooding”.)
“Floodway” or “Regulatory Floodway” – The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot.
“Freeboard” – A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of flood plain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, clogged bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.
“Highest Adjacent Grade” – The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
“Lowest Floor” – The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement.) An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this ordinance.
"Manufactured Home" – A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".

"Special Flood Hazard Area" – The land in the floodplain within a community subject to one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
"Start of Construction" (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the coastal Barrier Resources Act, Pub. L. 97-348) – Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one-hundred and eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

"Structure" – A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home, and a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
"Substantial Damage" – Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
"Substantial Improvement" – Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."

ARTICLE 6: CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
Section 6.01 General Provisions. The City Council may, by conditional use permit after a Public Hearing and referral to and recommendation from the Planning Commission, authorize and permit conditional uses as designated in the district use regulations. Approval shall be based on findings that the location and characteristics of the use will not be detrimental to the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the area.
Allowable uses may be permitted, enlarged, or altered upon application for a conditional use permit in accordance with the rules and procedures of this ordinance. The Council may grant or deny a conditional use permit in accordance with the intent and purpose of this ordinance. In granting a conditional use permit, the Council will authorize the issuance of a conditional use permit and shall prescribe and impose appropriate conditions, safeguards, and a specified time limit for the performance of the conditional use permit.
Section 6.02 Application for Conditional Use Permits. A request for a conditional use permit or modification of a conditional use permit may be initiated by a property owner or his or her authorized agent by filing an application with the City upon forms prescribed for the purpose. The application shall be accompanied by a drawing or site plan and other such plans and data showing the dimensions, arrangements, descriptions data, and other materials constituting a record essential to an understanding of the proposed use and proposed modifications in relation to the provisions set forth herein. A plan as to the operation and maintenance of the proposed use shall also be submitted. The application shall be accompanied with a non-refundable fee.
Section 6.03 Public Hearing. Before issuance of any conditional use permit, the Council will consider the application for the conditional use permit together with the recommendations of the Planning Commission at a public hearing after prior notice of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing has been given by publication in a legal paper of general circulation in the City of La Vista, one time at least ten (10) days prior to such hearing.
Section 6.04 Decisions. A majority vote of the Council shall be necessary to grant a conditional use permit. No order of the Council granting a conditional use permit, which has not been acted upon by the applicant, shall be valid for a period longer than twelve (12) months from the date of such order. Unless the following is completed:
6.04.01 City staff has granted an additional twelve (12) month administrative extension provided:
6.04.01.01 The character (including uses, parking conditions, traffic, and others) of the area in which the use(s) were approved has not changed significantly,
6.04.01.02 The applicant has made some effort to follow through with said permit or there were circumstances that slowed the applicants’ progress.
6.04.01.03 If the administrative extension of the second twelve (12) month period has lapsed without establishment of said conditionally permitted use; or, if staff deems the character of the area has changed within the initial twelve (12) month period, the applicant shall be required to reapply to both the Planning Commission and City Council for further approval(s).
Section 6.05 Standards. No conditional use permit shall be granted unless that Planning Commission or City Council has found:
6.05.01 That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the conditional use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, moral, comfort, or general welfare of the community.
6.05.02 That the conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purpose already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood.
6.05.03 That the establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal and orderly development of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district.
6.05.04 That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, and/or necessary facilities have been or are being provided.
6.05.05 That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
6.05.06 The use shall not include noise which is objectionable due to volume, frequency, or beat unless muffled or otherwise controlled.
6.05.07 The use shall not involve any pollution of the air by fly-ash, dust, vapors or other substance which is harmful to health, animals, vegetation or other property or which can cause soiling, discomfort, or irritation.
6.05.08 The use shall not involve any malodorous gas or matter which is discernible on any adjoining lot or property.
6.05.09 The use shall not involve any direct or reflected glare which is visible from any adjoining property or from any public street, road, or highway.
6.05.10 The use shall not involve any activity substantially increasing the movement of traffic on public streets unless procedures are instituted to limit traffic hazards and congestion.
6.05.11 The use shall not involve any activity substantially increasing the burden on any public utilities or facilities unless provisions are made for any necessary adjustments.

ARTICLE 7: SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS
Section 7.01 Sign Regulations
7.01.01 Purpose
The purpose of these sign regulations are: to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the city’s ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; to improve pedestrian and traffic safety; to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations. These sign regulations are adopted under the zoning authority of the city in furtherance of the more general purposes set forth in the zoning ordinance.
7.01.02 Applicability
A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created, or maintained within the city and the city’s extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction only in conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions and other requirements of these sign regulations.
7.01.03 Definitions and Interpretation
Words and phrases used in this ordinance shall have the meanings set forth in Section 2. Principles for computing sign area and sign height are contained in Section 7.01.04.
7.01.04 Computations
1. Computation of Area of Individual Signs
The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing as a whole, representation, emblem, or other display as a whole, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly identical to the display itself.
2. Computation of Area of Multi-faced Signs
The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than forty-two (42) inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
3. Computation of Height
The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the grade at the base of the sign, or from the grade immediately below the sign in the case of Wall Signs, at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be from finished grade. Any berms shall be construed to be a part of the sign base and added to the overall height of the sign.

6. Project Directory Signs (Ordinance No. 1145, 5-17-2011)
In order to maintain the flow of traffic on arterial and collector roads and to promote vehicular safety, emphasis is made to limit the number of ingress and egress points off of such roads. Project directory signs are intended to direct attention to planned multi-tenant developments which are not easily accessible off of such roads and where on-premise signage for that development (or any tenants within the development) would not otherwise be visible by the motorists traveling on nearby arterial or collector roads at the closest point of access. Provisions are provided to allow project directory signs which identify the name of the particular development and/or the names of their tenants. Such signs would be supplemental to signage otherwise provided for such developments.
Directional signs may be erected under the following conditions:
A. Access to the development is restricted. Full ingress and egress to the development off an arterial or collector road is limited by access constraints or non-existent.
B. Such signs may be placed on or off-premises. All such signs shall be constructed and located, however, so as to be visible by the motorist traveling on the arterial or collector road which intersects with the local road providing access to the development.
C. Setbacks for all Project Directory Signs shall be twenty (20) feet along a street designated as an arterial or collector and ten (10) feet along any street designated as a local, minor or private street.
D. A maximum of two project directory signs per development shall be allowed. No two signs shall be allowed closer than five-hundred (500) feet to each other on the same side of the street, measured along the edge of the street.
E. No such sign shall be allowed further than one-thousand (1,000) feet from any entity advertising on the sign using the closest straight line measurement.
F. The minimum distance between a sign location and any residential zoning district shall be 50 feet.
LA VISTA, NEBRASKA - ZONING ORDINANCE - 2001
98
G. The sign may contain the name of the development, names of tenants within the development, directional arrows and distance information. If off-premises, sign shall identify multiple businesses or industries.
H. The size of each sign shall be a function of the number of tenants within the development. Each eight (8) square feet per principal use within the development, whichever is greater, with a maximum area of eighty (80) square feet.
I. All such signs shall be a ground-mounted, monument-style sign.
J. Such signs shall be subject to the design standards of the PUD or Gateway Corridor Overlay District, if within such district.

Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term of any member whose term becomes vacant. One member only of the board of adjustment shall be appointed from the membership of the planning commission, and the loss of membership on the planning commission by such member shall also result in his or her immediate loss of membership on the board of adjustment and the appointment of another planning commissioner to the board of adjustment. After September 9,1995, the first vacancy occurring on the board of adjustment shall be filled by the appointment of a person who resides in the extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction of the City at such time as more than two hundred persons reside within such area. Thereafter, at all times, at least one (1) member of the board of adjustment shall reside outside of the corporate boundaries of the City but within its extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction.

As provided in Section 19-909, Reissue Revised Statutes of 1943 (in full): Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the City affected by any decision of the administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with the officer from whom appeal is taken and with the Board of Adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board of Adjustment, after the notice of the appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a court of record in application on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties, in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.
Section 8.03 Powers and Jurisdiction on Appeal
The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
8.03.01 To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official or agency based on or made in the enforcement of any zoning regulation or any regulation relating to the location or soundness of structures;
8.03.02 to hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, requests for interpretation of any map, or for decisions upon other special questions upon which the Board is authorized by this Ordinance to pass; and
7.03.03 To grant variances, where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of enactment of this Ordinance, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property, the strict application of any regulation under this Ordinance would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional and undue hardships upon the owner of such property, to authorize, upon an appeal relating to the property, a variance from such strict application so as to relieve such difficulties or hardship, if such relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this Ordinance.
8.03.03.01 The Board of Adjustment shall authorize no such variance, unless it finds that:
1. The strict application of the Ordinance would produce undue hardship;
LA VISTA, NEBRASKA - ZONING ORDINANCE - 2001
135
2. Such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district and the same vicinity;
3. The authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and the character of the district will not be changed by the granting of the variance; and
4. The granting of such variance is based upon reasons of demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for purposes of convenience, profit or caprice. No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds that the condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to this Ordinance.
In exercising the above mentioned powers, the Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of any such administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this Ordinance or to effect any variation in this Ordinance.

2. Vacations of streets, access control or easements (unless certain easements are determined by city staff to be unnecessary and for which proper release from the corresponding utility companies have been made and filed) are required or proposed,
3. Such action will result in significant increases in service requirements, e.g., utilities, schools, traffic control, streets, etc. or will interfere with maintaining existing service levels, e.g., additional curb cuts, repaving, etc.,
4. There is less street right-of-way than required by this ordinance or the Comprehensive Development Plan,
5. All easement requirements have not been satisfied,
6. The administrative plat will result in a tract without direct access to a street,
7. A substandard-sized lot or parcel will be created,
8. The lot has been previously split through the administrative plat process of either the City or the County.
3.08.04 No administrative plats shall be approved unless all required public improvements have been installed, no new dedication of public right-of-way or easements are involved, and such subdivision complies with the Zoning Ordinance requirements concerning minimum lot areas and dimensions of such lots.
3.08.05 Prior to the approval of the administrative plat, the subdivider shall provide a statement from the County Treasurer's Office showing there are no tax liens against said land within the proposed subdivision or any part thereof.

ARTICLE 4: DESIGN STANDARDS
Section 4.01 Minimum Design Standards.
No subdivision shall be approved unless it is in conformance with the requirements of this ordinance and the Comprehensive Development Plan or a waiver has been granted according to Section 8.01 of this ordinance.
In subdividing property, consideration shall be given to suitable sites for schools, parks, playgrounds, and other common areas for public use so as to best conform with any recommendations of the Comprehensive Development Plan. Any provisions for schools, parks, and playgrounds should be indicated on the preliminary plat in order that it may be determined when and in what manner such areas will be provided or acquired by an appropriate agency.
Land which the City has found to be unsuitable for subdividing, due to flooding, poor drainage, steep slopes, or other features likely to be harmful to the safety, welfare or health of the future residents, shall not be subdivided unless adequate methods for remediation are formulated by the developer and approved by the City that would eliminate or substantially reduce such hazards.
The City may require all contiguous land under common ownership to be submitted with the preliminary plat in order to evaluate overall development patterns, extensions of future roads and services, and conformity with the Comprehensive Development Plan.
If a proposed subdivision contains lots which are sufficiently larger parcels than the minimum required lot size of the zoning district, such parcels shall be arranged to permit, and the preliminary plat shall show, a logical future street and utility system and logical re-subdivision.
Section 4.02 Design Standards; Streets.
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the Comprehensive Development Plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of land to be serviced by such streets.
The street layout of the proposed subdivision shall provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of streets already existing in areas adjacent to the area being subdivided. Where, at the determination of the city with recommendation from the city engineer, it is desirable to provide street access to adjoining properties, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundaries of the subdivision. Where the city engineer deems it necessary, such dead-end streets shall be provided with an acceptable temporary turnaround.
Section 4.03 Design Standards; Dedication of Rights-of-way for New Streets.
The dedications of rights-of-way for new streets measured from lot line to lot line shall be shown on the plat and shall meet the right-of-way requirements as stated in Section 4.24 of this ordinance.
Frontage roads may be required by the City for subdivisions fronting on arterial streets.
Section 4.04 Design Standards; Dedication of Rights-of-way for Existing Streets.
Subdivisions platted along existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way or easements if necessary to meet the minimum right-of-way width requirements set forth in this ordinance. The entire minimum right-of-way width shall be dedicated where the subdivision is on both sides of an existing street. When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, one half (1/2) of the required right-of-way width, measured from the centerline of the existing roadway, shall be dedicated along with any proposed easements.
LA VISTA, NEBRASKA - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS - 2014 15
Section 4.05 Design Standards; Intersections.
Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at an angle of ninety (90) degrees, and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than sixty (60) degrees. Curbs at street intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least twenty (20) feet. When the smallest angle of street intersection is less than seventy-five (75) degrees, the City may require curb radii of greater length. Whenever necessary to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius without reducing the sidewalk at such street corner to less than nominal width, the property line at such street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such construction. No lot or other parcel of land which abuts on and has access to either a collector or minor street and abuts an arterial street shall have a service drive, curb cut, or other means of vehicular access to the arterial street.
Section 4.06 Minimum Design Standards; Curves in Streets; Horizontal.
A tangent at least one hundred (100) feet long shall be introduced between reversed curves on arterial and collector streets.
Where there is a deflection angle of more than ten (10) degrees in the horizontal alignment of a street, a curve with a radius adequate to ensure safe sight distance shall be made. Minimum requirements shall conform to the standards in Section 4.24 of this ordinance.
Section 4.07 Design Standards; Street Grades and Elevations.
All streets shall be designed so as to provide for the discharge of surface water from the pavement and from the right-of-way by grading and drainage. For adequate drainage, the minimum street grade shall not be less than seventy-five tenths (0.75' / 100') of one percent. Storm sewer construction shall be required where necessary to meet these minimum grade requirements. Street grades shall conform to the minimum requirements provided in Section 4.24 of this ordinance.
Section 4.08 Design Standards; Frontage Roads/Marginal Access Streets.
Where, upon review by the City, development which abuts or has included within the proposed subdivided area any Arterial, the City may require a marginal access road or other treatment which may be necessary to provide for the adequate protection of properties, and to afford separation of through and local traffic. Marginal access or frontage roads shall incorporate year-round screening between these roads and the adjacent arterial streets.
Section 4.09 Design Standards; Access/Egress.
The system shall provide adequate traffic flow through a subdivision and provide at least two routes from each lot within the subdivision to the rest of the City, except as explicitly permitted by the approving authorities. Additionally, the system should be designed to discourage through traffic from using local streets. The city engineer shall determine the most suitable location for said access points during the review period.
Section 4.10 Design Standards; Street Jogs.
Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred fifty (150) feet at intersections shall be prohibited.
Section 4.11 Design Standards; Cul-de-sac Streets.
Temporary dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs shall not be longer than three hundred (300) feet and shall provide a turnaround conforming to the requirements of Section 4.24 of this ordinance. The length of the cul-de-sac shall be measured from the center of the turnaround to the center of the intersecting street.
Section 4.12 Design Standards; Street Names.
Proposed streets which are in alignment with other existing streets shall bear the name of such streets. The name of a proposed street which is not in alignment with an existing street shall not be similar to the name of any existing street. To avoid duplication and confusion, the proposed names of all streets shall be reviewed by Sarpy County Emergency Management and approved by the City Public Works Director prior to such names being assigned or used.
Section 4.13 Design Standards; Private Streets.
New private streets may be created as part of a Plan Unit Development district, provided such streets are specifically
LA VISTA, NEBRASKA - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS - 2014 16
authorized by the City Council and dedicated as access easements. Design standards for private streets shall meet the requirements of Section 4.24.
Section 4.14 Design Standards; Blocks.
The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to the provisions of adequate access and circulation, building sites suitable to the needs of the use contemplated, zoning requirements regarding minimum lot sizes, widths and frontages and the limitations or opportunities presented by the topography. Block lengths, except in unusual circumstances, shall not exceed one thousand (1,000) feet. Pedestrian easements ten (10) feet wide may be required to be provided through or near the center of blocks more than five hundred (500) feet long in order to provide for pedestrian circulation.
Section 4.15 Design Standards; Lots.
The lot sizes, width, depth, shape and orientation shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated. Corner lots for residential uses shall have additional width to permit appropriate building setback distances and orientation to both streets. The subdividing of land shall be such as to provide each lot with satisfactory vehicular access by means of a public street or an approved private street. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to curved street lines.
Section 4.16 Design Standards; Double Frontage or Through Lots.
Double frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from arterial streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography. Where such lots are used in relation to an arterial street, a landscape screen easement of at least ten (10) feet in width shall be provided along the lot line of the lots abutting such arterial street and the subdivider shall install trees, shrubbery, fences or a combination thereof to screen the residential development from the arterial street and dampen the noise generated by traffic on the arterial street. Such screen shall be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the main structure on each of such lots.
Section 4.17 Design Standards; Easements.
Easements for sanitary or storm sewers, where necessary, shall be provided and shall be a total of at least fifteen (15) feet wide or wider when required by the city engineer.
Where a subdivision is traversed by a major watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided to the City a permanent storm water easement or drainage right-of-way of such width as will be adequate for both water flow and maintenance operations as determined by the City. No other surface improvements or fill, except trails, bank stabilization, and stabilization structures, shall be placed in any such easement right-of-way.
Where a subdivision is traversed by the Thompson Creek, Hell Creek, Big Papillion Creek, South Branch Papillion Creek or West Branch Papillion Creek, there shall be provided to the City and the Papio-Missouri River Natural Resources District a permanent easement adequate for construction, operation, and maintenance of channel and flood control improvements and public recreation trails in accordance with Papillion Creek Watershed Stormwater Management Policies. No other surface improvements or fill, except bank stabilization structures, shall be placed in any such easement right-of-way.
Perpetual easements shall be granted to the Omaha Public Power District and any telecommunications entity or other corporation transmitting communication signals authorized to use the city streets under a franchise agreement, to erect, operate, maintain, repair and renew poles, wires, cables, conduits, and other related facilities, and to extend thereon wires or cables for the carrying and transmission of electric current for light, heat, and power and for the transmission of signals and sounds of all kinds and the reception on, over, through, under and across a five (5) foot wide strip of land abutting all front and side boundary lot lines, and eight (8) foot wide strip of land abutting the rear boundary lines of all interior lots, and a sixteen (16) foot wide strip of land abutting the rear boundary lines of all exterior lots. The term “exterior lots” is herein defined as those lots forming the outer perimeter of the above-described addition. Said sixteen (16) foot wide easement will be reduced to an eight (8) foot wide strip when the adjacent land is surveyed, platted and recorded. No permanent buildings or retaining walls shall be placed in the said easement ways, but the same may be used for gardens, shrubs, landscaping and other purposes that do not then or later interfere with the afore-said uses or rights herein granted.
LA VISTA, NEBRASKA - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS - 2014 17
Perpetual easements shall be granted to Metropolitan Utilities District of Omaha, Black Hills Energy, and their successors and assigns, to erect, install, operate, maintain, repair and renew pipelines, hydrants and other related facilities, and to extend thereon pipes for the transmission of gas and water on, through, under and across a five (5) foot wide strip of land abutting the turn-around portion of all cud-de-sac streets. No permanent buildings or retaining walls shall be placed in the said easement ways, but the same may be used for gardens, shrubs, landscaping and other purposes that do not, then or later, interfere with the afore-said uses or rights herein granted.
Section 4.18 Design Standards: Storm Sewer System.
The storm sewer system shall be designed in accordance with the Omaha Regional Storm Water Design Manual, Papillion Creek Watershed Plan, and Chapter 154 of the City Code all as amended from time to time. In addition, provisions shall be made to limit the ten (10) year peak rate of storm water discharge from the subdivision. Post-development peak runoff rate shall not exceed one and one-quarter (1.25) times the pre-development runoff rate at any time following post-development based upon a ten (10) year storm event. Pre-development shall be the condition prior to improvements being started, including agricultural uses. For single family subdivisions, storm water management facilities should be community-based in outlots rather than on individual private lots.
Section 4.19 Design Standards: Sanitary Sewer System.
Design standards for sanitary sewers shall conform to Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality Standards.
Section 4.20 Design Standards: Sidewalks.
All sidewalks within subdivisions shall have a minimum pavement width of five (5) feet and minimum pavement thickness of six (6) inches along major or other arterials and four (4) inches everywhere else, all of which shall be located within the right-of-way or pedestrian access easement and not directly abutting any street. Minimum distance between edge of walk and curb shall be six (6) feet.
All sidewalks, crossings, and other segments of a pedestrian system must comply with the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Ramps with truncated domes shall be installed at all public street crossings and private roadway/driveway crossings that have traffic control access.
Section 4.21 Design Standards: Flood Hazards.
Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically unsuitable for residential or other development shall not be platted for such purposes. Such land may be set aside on the plat for such uses compatible with the hazards associated with flooding or erosion. All development shall conform to the flood plain management regulations of the Zoning Ordinance.
Section 4.22 Design Standards: Creek Setback.
No person shall be granted a permit for the construction of any structure, exclusive of bank stabilization structures, adjacent to any creek or stream unless such structure is located so that no portion thereof is any closer to the stream than will allow a maximum three-to-one (3:1) slope plus twenty (20) feet between the water’s edge of the stream and the closest point on the structure at grade. For those creeks or streams designated in the Papillion Creek Watershed Plan, the setback shall be increased to allow a maximum three-to-one (3:1) slope plus fifty (50) feet between the water’s edge of the stream and the closest point on the structure at grade. As used herein, the edge of the water of the stream shall be the point constituting the edge of the water during normal flow conditions.
A property shall be exempt from the before mentioned provisions upon a showing by a registered professional engineer that adequate bank stabilization structures or slope protection will be installed in the construction of said structure, having an estimated useful life equal to that of the structure, which will provide adequate erosion control conditions coupled with adequate lateral support so that no portion of said structure adjacent to the stream will be endangered by erosion or lack of lateral support. In the event that the structure is adjacent to any stream which has been channelized or otherwise improved by any agency of government, then such certification providing an exception to the before mentioned may take the form of a certification to the adequacy and protection of the improvements installed by such governmental agency.

Before preliminary or final plat approval is given, the City may require the subdivider to reserve sites for parks, playgrounds, open space, schools, and other public land consistent with the Comprehensive Development Plan, as determined by the City. Reservation of land for public acquisition and/or use shall be for a period not to exceed five (5) years from the date the plat is officially recorded unless otherwise provided for in the subdivision agreement. If such reserved site is not acquired by the City or other governmental entity within said five (5) year period, the subdivider may then re-subdivide the site for alternative purposes and sell any or all of the site after giving written notice to the City to make a determination on acquisition.
In certain situations, the contemplated use of land creates or contributes to the public need for land or facilities including but not limited to recreational and public safety facilities created by the nature of the development and use of land. In such situations, the City may require dedication and/or other appropriate subdivider contribution to the cost of satisfying such need.
Where a park, playground, school, or other site for public use indicated in the Comprehensive Development Plan is located in whole or in part in the applicant's subdivision the City will determine the density and location of said park or other public use and may require the immediate acquisition or reservation of such area or may accept the dedication of such area.

7.02.03 Payment of all required fees identified in the subdivision agreement.

LA VISTA, NEBRASKA - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS - 2014 25
Section 7.03 Improvements: Financing.
7.03.01 As to those portions of the subdivision that are situated within the corporate limits of the City, the subdivider may petition the City to create City Improvement (Assessment) Districts to allow for the financing of improvements within the subdivision. Depending on the City’s financial condition, the City’s evaluation of risk of failure or delay in subdivision build out, the City’s evaluation of the debt impact on the City, or other sufficient reason as determined by the City, the City may or may not grant the subdivider’s request. In the event the City creates assessment districts, the subdivider shall deposit with the City funds equal to twenty percent (20%) or more of the cost of improvements as determined from the city engineer’s estimates prior to receipt of bids and award of contracts. The City may finance up to eighty percent (80%) of the cost of construction of said improvements. Such petition shall be in the form prescribed by the City and shall be executed by the owners of all the lots situated within the proposed improvement district. The cost of all such improvements in the district which are constructed shall be specially assessed against the land benefited thereby, to the full extent of special benefits, and unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the City prior to the time of the City’s approval of the final plat, the entire cost of all public improvements in said subdivision shall be deemed to be of special benefit to the property situated therein, and the full cost thereof, including engineering fees, attorney’s fees and other related costs, shall be specially assessed against such property. The City shall, in no event, be bound to form such a district, and if such a district be formed, the City shall not be required to install improvements therein until, in the opinion of the City, economic conditions warrant such installation; provided, the City shall have the right to limit the size of the final plat.
7.03.02 As to those portions of the subdivision that are situated outside the corporate limits of the City but within the zoning jurisdiction of the City, the subdivider may cause such improvements to be constructed by a street improvement district or sanitary and improvement district in accordance with the appropriate state law. However, the city engineer shall not certify to the City that the required improvements have been satisfactorily arranged for until the subdivider presents certified evidence that the improvement district has been duly formed and has executed contracts for the required work in that portion of said street improvement district or sanitary and improvement district included in the final plat. It is further provided, however, that if the City has approved a final plat for a phase of the area comprised in the preliminary plat, the subdivider may submit for final platting of the next phase only if the required improvements have been installed in the first phase, or have been contracted for as above provided in the phase comprised in the final plat theretofore approved. Subsequent applications for final platting shall be processed in the same manner.
7.03.03 Whether within or without the corporate limits of the City, expenditures of public debt may not exceed the amount to be received from special assessments in respect to the improvements, except as the City may otherwise agree.
7.03.04 Whether within or without the corporate limits of the City, the subdivider may use the private financing method which creates no public debt in respect to which the City may become liable.
7.03.05 When private financing is proposed, the subdivider is required to submit proof of financial capability to construct the proposed infrastructure.
Section 7.04 Subdivision Agreement.
A subdivision agreement, unless otherwise determined by the City Engineer, shall be required as a condition of any plat or replat approved by the City, containing such parties, terms and conditions as the City Engineer determines necessary or advisable. Not in limitation of the foregoing sentence, no contract for the construction of public improvements or shared private infrastructure improvements involving any subdivision in the within the city limits or extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city of La Vista shall be let, awarded, or otherwise consummated by the subdivider unless first entering into a formal subdivision agreement between the city, the subdivider, and/or the Sanitary Improvement District concerning such matters as the City Engineer determines necessary or advisable, including without limitation, land acquisition for public improvements, minimum design for utilities, pavements, open spaces, recreation facilities, erosion and sedimentation control methods, both temporary and permanent, and assessments for the costs to be incurred as a general obligation by the Sanitary Improvement District, development corporation, or other persons to be involved in this contract. The city will consider all sections of Article 7 of this ordinance in entering a contractual agreement covering the assessment of costs for public improvements.

The subdivider or the sanitary and improvements district shall reimburse the City for such costs incurred by the City for plan review, plan check, and plan approval as to conformance with approved City standards and specifications.
Subdivider, or the SID, shall pay to the City an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the actual construction cost of subdivider paid improvements as administrative expenses incurred by the City in connection with the administration of this Agreement. Estimated payment shall be made on the basis of two percent (2%) of the construction and/or installation cost estimates for the various improvements computed by the subdivider’s engineer, which estimated amount shall be paid to the City at the time the plans and specifications are submitted to the City for final approval.
Section 7.07 Failure to Complete Improvements.
If any portion of the required improvements shall fail to be completed and accepted for dedication in compliance with this Article 7 within the required time period, either for reason of non-compliance or for reason of substandard and unacceptable construction, the City, in addition to any other rights or remedies under applicable law or equity, shall have the option to pursue any rights or remedies under any bond or other security provided with respect to said improvements.
Where the City Council is not already in possession of said security, it shall immediately take the actions necessary to obtain it. Upon receipt of the security, the City Council shall use such to finance the completion of the improvements or rebuilding of substandard improvements. Unused portions of the surety shall be returned to the subdivider without interest.
Section 7.08 Certification and Inspection.
Upon completion of the improvements, the city engineer or other authorized person shall file with the City a statement either certifying that the improvements meet the requirements of the city or provide a statement indicating the improvements do not meet the requirements of the approved plans and specifications.
Upon completion of the improvements, the subdivider through use of a registered professional engineer shall file with the City a statement stipulating the following:

7.08.03 That there are no known defects from any cause in the improvements.
7.08.04 That these improvements are free and clear of any encumbrances or lien.
If the city engineer or other authorized person has certified that the improvements are complete and free from defect, the City shall accept any dedication of improvements. The City may, at its discretion, accept the dedication of any portion of the improvements provided that all statements and agreements specified above have been received for that portion of the improvements.
The city engineer or other authorized person shall regularly inspect the condition of required improvements for defects.
LA VISTA, NEBRASKA - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS - 2014 27
Section 7.09 Reduction of Guarantees.

Section 7.10 Release of Guarantee.
Upon acceptance, in accordance with Section 7.02.06 of the ordinance, the City shall authorize the release of the performance bond or the escrow.
Section 7.11 Operation and Maintenance.
It is the intention of the City to provide no services other than planning, zoning, building code enforcement, and subdivision regulations administration to the jurisdictional area beyond the corporate limits of the City. Therefore, it shall be the obligation of the subdivider to present to the City a precise method for the operation and maintenance of improvements in the subdivision. Said method may include formation of districts, owners’ associations or other methods to operate and maintain such improvements. Said method shall be binding on the subdivider in a form, agreement, or contract acceptable to the City.
