members of minority and women's groups from employment or
advancement at the departmental level and will include both yearly and
§ 8-5 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 8-6
8:16
§ 8-7. Recruitment.
long-range goals and timetables for achieving appropriate
representation of women and minorities within their department.
B. Departmental goals should be significant, measurable and attainable
and be designated to correct identifiable deficiencies.
(1) Goals should provide for specific planned results with timetables
for completion.
(2) Goals should take into consideration plans for expansion and
turnover of the work force with the presumption that qualified or
qualifiable minorities and women are in the area work force.
(3) Goals should reflect desired levels of achievement based upon an
analysis to resolve imbalances in its work force.
(4) Goals should be coupled with adoption of genuine and effective
internal techniques and procedures to locate qualified members of
women and minorities.
C. Department plans should be submitted within 90 days after the
adoption of the city's Affirmative Action Plan.
(1) The city's AAP is predicated on a five-year goal. After determining
employee turnover for the past five years, all departments shall
make a projection of their anticipated hiring activity for the next
five years. If a department hired 10 people in the category of
craftsmen since June 1, 1972, then that department shall anticipate
that it will hire 10 craftsmen in the next five years. It is realized
that precisely the numbers projected may not be hired; however,
this kind of projection is necessary in order to determine an
appropriate hiring goal for minority employees in each job
category.
(2) Once a projection of overall hiring activity has been made, each
department shall then establish goals for the number of minority
and women employees it intends to add to its work force in each
category where there is presently an underutilization. To be
acceptable, goals shall be based on the number of hires anticipated
in each job category, and in departments where it is found that the
existing percentage of minority and women employees is below the
level consistent with parity on the basis of population and/or
available work force, the sum total of all future hiring shall never
include a number of minority and/or women employees that is less
than 50% of the total future hiring until the goal is achieved.
A. Establishment of an aggressive recruitment program to attract
minorities and women is primarily the responsibility of the City
Administrator. The City Affirmative Action Officer and departments will
support this effort as it relates to their individual needs.
§ 8-6 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION § 8-7
8:17
§ 8-8. Testing and selection process.

commissions by the aggrieved party, his representatives or any person
affected so that appropriate action may be taken, up to and including

(1) Informal. The EEO Officer is designated to act in an effort to
mediate or conciliate informal complaints. However, informal
complaints should be resolved generally at the department or
supervisory level through the City Administrator with concurrence
from the EEO Officer.
§ 8-9 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION § 8-10
8:19
(a) When an informal complaint is received by the EEO Officer, a
memorandum shall be prepared by the EEO Officer to the City
Administrator advising him of the complaint and the
circumstances of such complaint.
(b) The EEO Officer shall ensure prompt consideration of each
complaint filed with his office. If, after the investigation of the
complaint, the EEO Officer concludes that the complaint is not
valid or no discriminatory act has occurred, he may dismiss the
charge. Any complainant adversely affected by the dismissal of
the charge retains all other administrative and legal remedies.
(c) If, after a consideration of the complaint, the EEO Officer
believes that an act of discrimination may have occurred,
within 15 work days after said determination is made, the EEO
Officer shall personally attempt to conciliate the matter. If the
parties to the complaint agree on a resolution by way of
conciliation, the terms of such resolution shall be set forth in a
written enforceable consent agreement, which shall not
constitute an admission of committing a discriminatory act.
(d) If either the respondent or the complainant fails to comply with
any obligation or requirement which forms part of any such
decision, said decision may be enforced by executive order
from the office of the City Administrator.
(2) Formal. Any informal complaint not adjudicated to the satisfaction
of either or both parties by the EEO Officer may thereafter be
handled through formal complaint procedures, as well as other
administrative and legal remedies.
(a) Formal hearings may be convened in cases in which
conciliation or mediation has failed or where either party so
requests. A formal complaint shall be submitted in writing,
shall be signed and shall state the basis for the complaint.
However, a statement from the complainant describing the
conduct and/or conditions complained of with greater
particularity may be required by the EEO Officer or the EEO
Committee.
(b) Formal hearing procedure.
[1] Step 1. A complaint of discrimination shall initially be
referred to the EEO Committee through the EEO Officer.
The EEO Officer shall consult with committee members to
ascertain the date, time and place for the hearing. All
hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the
administrative hearing procedures as set up by the EEO
Committee. Written notification of the hearing shall be
given to both the complainant and the respondent and
shall include the date, time and place of the hearing. The
hearing shall be recorded and the complainant and
§ 8-10 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 8-10
8:20
respondent shall be permitted to have access to the
record, but any transcription requested by either party
shall be at its expense. Both parties or their
representatives and members of the EEO Committee shall
be permitted to question all witnesses and to present all
relevant evidence. After hearing all of the evidence and
arguments, the Committee will have prepared a written
decision based solely on the evidence presented at the
hearing.
[2] Step 2. The EEO Officer shall certify the decision of the
Committee and dispose of it within 10 days by notifying
the complainant and respondent in writing of the decision.
[3] Step 3. Within five days of notification of the decision made
by the Committee, the complainant, if having determined
that the decision has not rendered satisfactory judgment,
shall be advised in writing by the EEO Officer of his further
rights of appeal to state and federal agencies.
Transcriptions of record shall be made at city expense for
the appeal.
(c) A complaint may be filed by any employee or applicant related
to employment in the city government who believes that
discrimination related to employment has been practiced
against him/her or that an employment practice in the city
government has or will result in discrimination in employment
against him/her. A complaint of general discriminatory
employment may also be filed by an employee or applicant for
employment or by an organization; provided, however, that
upon request of the EEO Officer, the complainant shall furnish
to the EEO Officer names of individuals whom the complainant
suspects are adversely affected by those practices, and such
names shall be held confidential by the EEO Officer upon
request of such individuals.
(d) All complaints shall be submitted within 180 calendar days of
the alleged discriminatory act giving rise to the complaint, and
the EEO Officer is charged to notify the accused party of the
particulars of such complaint within three working days from
the time of its submission.
(e) A complainant may request in writing an individual or an
organization to represent him in the processing of his
complaint and is entitled to the advice of a representative at all
stages in the proceeding. If the representative designated by
the complainant is an employee of the city government, such
employee, as well as an employee-complainant, shall have a
reasonable amount of administrative leave with pay, if he is in
pay status, for the purpose of appearing at any hearing on the
complaint or conciliation effort. The rights and privileges set
§ 8-10 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION § 8-10
8:21
§ 8-11. Additional remedies.
Any person aggrieved by a violation of this chapter who has exhausted the
remedies herein provided may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction
for appropriate relief, including but not limited to:
§ 8-12. Applicability.
If any provision of this chapter or the application thereof to any person
or circumstances is held invalid, the remainder of this chapter and the

the decision to the City Administrator or his designee in accordance
with the provisions of § 13-9F. Reasons for decertifying a business shall

§ 13-9. Recertification.
A certified VBE shall submit any information requested by the Finance/
Purchasing Department annually to ascertain whether such business is still
a qualified VBE pursuant to this program. If it is determined that the annual
submission of information has changed to such an extent that the VBE
status has changed, affecting the certified status, the Finance/Purchasing
Department may recommend that the business be required to reapply for
certification pursuant to this program.
§ 13-10. Certification standards.
To determine whether a business shall be recommended by the Finance/
Purchasing Department to be certified as a legitimate VBE, the following, in
conjunction with information submitted by the applicant, shall be used:
be expressed by certified mail. The decertified business may not
reapply for certification for a period of time to be determined by the
City Administrator and/or his designee, but in no event longer than a
period of one year.
A. Eligible VBEs under this program shall be independent businesses.
There shall be conclusive evidence that the ownership and control of
such business is real, substantial and continuing and shall go beyond
the pro forma ownership of the business as reflected in its ownership
documents. The VBE owners shall enjoy the customary interests of
ownership. They shall share in the risks and profits commensurate with
their interest of ownership. Recognition of the business as separate
entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient for
recognition as a VBE. To determine the legitimacy of an independent
VBE, the Finance/Purchasing Department shall consider all relevant
factors concerning ownership and control of business assets, including
but not limited to the date the business was established, whether its
resources for the work of the contract are adequate and the degree to
which financial, equipment-leasing and other relationships with non-
VBE firms vary from industry practice.
B. The VBE's owners shall have the power to direct or cause management
and policy directions of the firm/business as well as make major
decisions on matters of management, policy and operations. The firm
shall not be subject to any restrictions limiting the customary
discretions of the veteran owners. This shall include provisions in
bylaws, partnership agreements or charter requirements for
cumulative voting rights or otherwise that prevent the veteran owners,
without the cooperation or vote of any owner who is not a veteran, from
making a business decision of the firm.
C. Where non-veteran owners of the firm are disproportionately
responsible for the firm's operation, then, by the standards of this
program, the firm is not controlled by veterans and shall not be

§ 13-11. Violations and penalties.
considered a VBE business within the program's meaning on the basis
of veteran ownership.
D. In establishing a status of a legitimate VBE, all securities which
constitute qualifying ownership and/or control of a corporation shall be
held directly by veterans. Securities held in trust or by any guardian for
a minor shall not be considered as held by a veteran in determining the
ownership and/or control of a corporation.
E. Capital or expertise contributed by veteran owners to acquire their
interest in the firm shall be real and substantial. A promise to
contribute capital, a note payable to the firm or its owners who are not
veterans or the mere participation as an employee, rather than as a
manager, shall be examples of insufficient contributions.
F. In determining eligibility as a VBE, in addition to the above standards,
the Finance/Purchasing department shall give special consideration to
the following circumstances:
(1) VBEs which are newly formed and whose ownership and/or control
have changed since the date and/or time of the advertisement of
the contract shall be closely monitored to determine the reasons
and the relationship between the timing, formation and/or change
in the firm.
(2) Careful scrutiny and review of previous and/or continuing and/or
time of the relationships between or among present owners shall
be conducted to ensure that the employer/owner has the
management responsibilities pursuant to this program.
(3) Any relationship between a VBE and a non-veteran-owned business
having interest in the VBE shall be carefully monitored to
determine if the interest of the VBE conflicts with the ownership
and control requirements of this program.
G. Joint ventures may be eligible to compete as VBEs under this program,
provided that the VBE partner of the joint venture meets the eligibility
standards of a VBE set forth herein and the VBE partner shares in the
ownership, control and management responsibilities, the risks and
profits of the joint venture and the VBE partner is responsible for a
clearly defined portion of the work to be performed.
A. When the City determines, after hearing, that a business has been
classified as a VBE on the basis of false information knowingly supplied
by the business and has been awarded a contract to which it would not
otherwise have been entitled under this chapter, the City may:
(1) Assess against the business any difference between the contract
and what the City's cost would have been if the contract had not
been awarded in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40A:11-48, the City Administrator and/or Chief

of total procurements awarded to VBE. Council shall publish a list of the
City's attainments in the immediately preceding fiscal year, including the
municipal or county average, in a newspaper circulate in the municipality
by March 1 of each year.

ARTICLE I
Copies of Government Records
[Adopted 8-5-2002 by Ord. No. 24-2002]
§ 126-1. Title.
This article shall be known as the "City of Pleasantville Access to
Government Records and Establishment of Fees Ordinance."
§ 126-2. Purpose.
It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the City of Pleasantville to
recognize the public's general right to know pursuant to the Open Public
Records Act.67 All records kept in the course of official duties by any City of
Pleasantville officer or employee shall be deemed to be government records,
as that ten is defined by N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1, and such records shall be subject
to inspection by the public unless exempt under the statutes or other
regulation, common law practice, executive order of the Governor, Rules of
Court, federal law or judicial decision; this article was established to comply
with the mandate of N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq., known as the Open Public
Records Act, including that portion of the law permitting the establishment
of charges/fees, not otherwise provided, to be imposed and associated with
the reproduction of the materials requested.
§ 126-3. Custodian of records; records request form.
§ 126-4. Inspection and copying of public records.
A. In accordance with N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1, the Municipal Clerk or his/her
designee is designated as the custodian of records with the exception of
the records kept by the Police or Fire Department. The Chief of Police
or his/her designee shall be the custodian of records for the City of
Pleasantville Police Department and the Chief of the Pleasantville Fire
Department or his/her designee shall be the custodian of records for the
City of Pleasantville Fire Department.
B. The City recognizes the fact that the daily operation of the various
departments regularly involves the distribution of public records, as the
term is defined by state law, to the public, and that it would be
inefficient to require that all requests be submitted to the City Clerk. In
an effort to make records available within the time frames specified by
the law, the City will continue this policy in addition to the procedure
provided by this article.
A. Any person seeking to inspect, examine or copy a public record of this
municipality shall make application in writing to the Municipal Clerk, or
other custodian identified by this article, during regular business hours,
67.Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.
§ 126-1 DISORDERLY CONDUCT § 126-4
125:199
§ 126-5. Time limits for compliance.
Unless a shorter time period is otherwise provided by statute, regulation
of executive order, the Clerk shall grant access to a government record or
deny a request for access to a record as soon as possible but not later than
seven business days after receiving the request, provided that the record
is currently available and not in storage or archived. In the event that the
Clerk fails to respond within seven business days after receiving a request,
the failure to respond shall be deemed a denial of the request, unless the
requestor has elected not to provide a name, address or telephone number,
or other means of contacting the requestor. If the requestor has elected not
to provide an address, or telephone number, or other means of contacting
the requestor, the custodian shall not be required to respond until the
on the form provided. All requests for public records shall be as specific
as possible, including the type of record and date created, if known.
B. The Municipal Clerk or other custodian shall promptly comply with a
request to inspect, examine, copy or provide a copy of a government
record. If the custodian is unable to comply with a request for access,
he or she shall indicate on the request form the specific basis for such
inability to comply and shall promptly return it to the requestor. The
custodian shall sign and date the form and provide the requestor with a
copy thereof.
C. In those instances where the nature of the request to the record itself
leads the custodian to doubt whether or not the record is a government
record as defined by law or is a record exempt from disclosure, the
Clerk shall request an opinion from the Municipal Attorney. A copy of
the request form shall be forwarded to the attorney, who, after review
and investigation, shall issue an opinion and note such opinion on the
request form and promptly return to the custodian.
D. If any part of a particular record is exempt from public access pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq., the custodian shall delete, redact or excise
from a copy of the record that portion which is exempt from access and
shall promptly permit access to the remainder of the record.
E. If the record requested is temporarily unavailable because it is in use or
storage, the custodian shall so advise the requestor and shall make
arrangements to make a copy of the record available.
F. If a request for access to a government record would substantially
disrupt municipal operations, the Clerk may deny access to the record
after attempting to reach a reasonable solution with the requestor that
accommodates the interests of the requestor and the municipality.
G. As required by N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5e, immediate access shall be granted for
access to budgets, bills, vouchers, contracts (including collective
negotiations agreements and individual employment contracts), and
public salary and overtime information.
§ 126-4 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 126-5
125:200
requestor reappears before the custodian seeking a response to the original
request. If the government record is in storage or archived, the requestor
shall be so advised within seven business days after the custodian receives
the request. The requestor shall be advised by the custodian when the
record can be made available. If the record is not made available by that
time, access shall be deemed denied.
§ 126-6. Posting of appeals procedures.
The Clerk shall post prominently in public view, in or adjacent to the Clerk's
office, a statement that sets forth in clear, concise and specific terms the
right to appeal a denial or failure to provide access to government record
and the procedure by which an appeal may be filed.
§ 126-7. Viewing of government records; removal prohibited.
§ 126-8. Procedures and fee for purchasing copies of public
records.
Copies of records may be purchased for the fee prescribed by law or
regulation. If a fee is not prescribed by law or regulation, the fee shall be

accompanied by the custodian or his or her authorized representative.

ARTICLE I
Statutory Authorization; Findings of Fact; Purpose and Objectives
§ 139-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et seq.
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of City of Pleasantville, of
Atlantic County, New Jersey does ordain as follows.
§ 139-2. Findings of fact.
§ 139-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. The flood hazard areas of City of Pleasantville are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
§ 139-1 FIREARMS § 139-3
131:215
§ 139-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in
the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Pleasantville
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy
any violation.
§ 139-9. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter
and other ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
§ 139-10. Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
§ 139-11. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
A. Considered as minimum requirements;
B. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
A. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare
occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the area of special
flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of City of Pleasantville,
any officer or employee thereof or the Federal Insurance
Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway,
assure that the encroachment provisions of 5.3[1]74 are met.
74.Editor's Note: So in original.
§ 139-12 FIREARMS § 139-14
131:225
(4) Review all development permits in the coastal high-hazard area of
the area of special flood hazard to determine if the proposed
development alters sand dunes so as to increase potential flood
damage.
(5) Review plans for walls to be used to enclose space below the base
flood level in accordance with § 139-18B(4).
B. Use of other base flood and floodway data. When base flood elevation
and floodway data has not been provided in accordance with § 139-7,
Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard, the Construction
Official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other
source, in order to administer § 139-17A, Residential construction, and

Environmental Protection, Dam Safety and Flood Control Section
and the Land Use Regulation Program prior to any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Federal Insurance Administration.
(2) Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so the flood-carrying capacity
is not diminished.
E. Interpretation of FIRM boundaries. Make interpretations where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict
between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person
contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in § 139-15.
§ 139-14 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 139-15

when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Construction Official in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
(3) Those aggrieved by the decision of the Atlantic County Board of
Appeals, or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Atlantic
County Board of Appeals, as provided in this chapter.
(4) In passing upon such applications, the Atlantic County Board of
Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
(a) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(b) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner;
(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
(e) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(f) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program of that area;
(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(j) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave
action, if applicable, expected at the site; and,
§ 139-15 FIREARMS § 139-15
131:227
(k) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems, and streets and bridges.
(5) Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection A(4) and the
purposes of this chapter, the Atlantic County Board of Appeals may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
(6) The Construction Official shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions, including technical information, and report any variances
to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the
items in § 139-15A(4)(a) through (k) have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and,
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in § 139-15A(4), or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
§ 139-15 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 139-15
131:228
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

of practice for compliance with the provisions of Subsection B(1)
and (2)(a) and (b).
(4) Space below the lowest floor.
(a) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a
structure started after the enactment of this chapter shall not
enclose the space below the lowest floor unless breakaway
walls, open wood lattice-work or insect screening are used as
provided for in this section.
(b) Breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work or insect screening
shall be allowed below the base flood elevation provided that
they are intended to collapse under wind and water loads
without causing collapse, displacement or other structural
damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting
foundation system. Breakaway walls shall be designed for a
safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20
pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed
a design safe loading of 20 pounds per square foot (either by
design or when so required by local or State codes) may be
permitted only if a registered professional engineer or
architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following
conditions:
[1] Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less
than that which would occur during the base flood; and
[2] The elevated portion of the building and supporting
foundation system shall not be subject to collapse,
displacement or other structural damage due to the effects
of wind and water load acting simultaneously on all
building components (structural and nonstructural). Water
loading values used shall be those associated with the base
flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by
applicable state or local building standards.
(c) If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be
used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage
and not for human habitation.
(d) Prior to construction, plans for any breakaway wall must be
submitted to the Construction Code Official or Building
Subcode Official for approval.
C. Sand dunes. Prohibit man-made alteration of sand dunes within Zones
VE and V on the community's DFIRM which would increase potential
flood damage.

whether natural or unnatural, so as to outweigh whatever other merits
it may possess.
C. Books and magazines. A book or magazine containing photographs,
paintings or illustrations of the type defined as obscene in Subsection B
is obscene if, considered as a whole, its calculated purpose or dominant
effect is substantially to arouse sexual desires, whether natural or

whatever other merits it may possess. A book or magazine containing
no photographs, paintings or illustrations shall not be considered
obscene for purposes of this chapter.
D. Objects. An object is obscene if it is by itself a recognizable
reproduction of a sexual organ, including breasts, or if some part of it
consists of a recognizable reproduction of sexual organs substantially
exaggerated in size or appearance.
E. Acts. An act is obscene if it involves the naked display of sexual organs,
including breasts, or if it is explicitly suggestive of sexual acts or if it
involves sexual acts.
A. Any person desiring to make commercial distribution or commercial
display of a film or moving picture which he has reason to believe may
be obscene shall first submit it for inspection by the Review Committee,

175:289
§ 175-5. Violations and penalties.97
Anyone having violated § 175-2 of this chapter shall be subject to a fine of
not less than $100 nor more than $1,000, imprisonment in the county jail
for a period not exceeding 90 days and/or a period of community service not
consisting of the Mayor, a consenting elected or appointed officer of
the City of Pleasantville and a consenting resident of said city who is
registered to vote therein, the latter two to be appointed by and to serve
at the pleasure of said Mayor without compensation, which Review
Committee shall act by a majority of the members thereof.
B. The applicant shall give the Review Committee written notice of his
intention to submit any film or moving picture for inspection. Said
notice shall be delivered to the Review Committee or to the City Clerk
and shall contain the applicant's name, address within the city and
telephone number where he can be reached during business hours.
Within 24 hours (Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excepted) of receipt
of said notice the Review Committee shall make itself available to said
applicant during business hours for the purpose of inspecting the film
or moving picture. The Review Committee shall reasonably notify the
applicant of the appointed time either by telephone or by written notice
left at the address within the city stated by the applicant. (The failure of
the applicant to cooperate in any way in arranging a time for inspection
within said 24 hours shall not relieve said applicant of the duty to
submit the film or moving picture for inspection as soon thereafter as
possible and prior to any commercial distribution or commercial
display.) The applicant shall bring the film or moving picture, together
with any necessary projector, screen and operating personnel, to the
Review Committee or City Clerk at the City Hall of the City of
Pleasantville, whereupon the applicant shall show the film or moving
picture for the inspection of the Review Committee. Within 72 hours
(Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excepted) of the termination of said
inspection, the Review Committee shall either inform the applicant in
writing that the commercial distribution or commercial display of said
film or moving picture has been refused and that the city will seek to
have the same enjoined if necessary because of its obscene character;
or that said film has been approved.
C. It shall be a violation of this section to make commercial distribution or
commercial display of any obscene film or moving picture prior to the
expiration of said seventy-two-hour period. Nothing herein shall
prevent the applicant from making commercial distribution or
commercial display of said film or moving picture after the end of said
seventy-two-hour period, subject to any judicial restraints imposed, and
further subject to any penalties under § 175-5 of this chapter should
said film or moving picture ultimately be adjudged obscene by a court of
law.

exceeding 90 days. Anyone having violated § 175-4 of this chapter, and the
film or moving picture having been adjudged obscene in a court of law in
the same or a separate proceeding, shall be subject to a separate penalty
of imprisonment in the county jail for a period not exceeding 90 days or a
fine of not less than $100 nor more than $1,000, imprisonment for a term
not exceeding 90 days and/or a period of community service for not more
than 90 days. Each separate film, moving picture, photograph, painting,
illustration, book, magazine, object or act, and each issue of them, which
is commercially distributed or commercially displayed shall constitute a
separate offense under this chapter. Each separate commercial distribution
or commercial display, whether to different persons or to the same person,
shall constitute a separate offense under this chapter.
§ 175-6. Interpretation and enforcement.
Notwithstanding any other section, clause or provision of this chapter to
the contrary, the definitions of "obscene" and "obscenity," for all purposes
of interpretation and enforcement of this chapter shall be construed in
accordance with and in no event more strictly than the criteria set forth
in N.J.S.A. 2C:34-2 et seq., as same shall be from time to time amended
or supplemented, as well as in accordance with and not more strictly
than judicial interpretations thereof pursuant to the Constitution of the
United States and of the State of New Jersey finally concluded in courts of
jurisdiction sufficient to render decisions on constitutional questions having
general application.

calendar days after having been notified of the additional
information or documents required.

private profit and not for First Amendment expression.
(4) Another special event permit application has been received prior in
time, or has already been approved, to hold another event at the
same time and place requested by the applicant or so close in time
and place as to cause undue traffic congestion or the Police
Department is unable to meet the needs for police services for both
events; or
(5) The time, route, or size of the event will substantially interrupt the
safe and orderly movement of traffic contiguous to the event site or
route or disrupt the use of a street at a time when it is usually
subject to great traffic congestion; or
(6) The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at the site of
the event, or the assembly and disbanding areas around an event,
§ 178-6 PARADES AND OTHER SPECIAL EVENTS § 178-7
178:295
§ 178-8. Permit conditions.
The Chief of Police may also condition the issuance of a special events
permit by imposing reasonable requirements concerning the time, place,
and manner of the event and such requirements as are necessary to protect
the safety of persons and property and the control of traffic, provided such
conditions shall not unreasonably restrict the right of free speech. Such
conditions include:
will prevent proper police, fire, or ambulance services to areas
contiguous to the event; or
(7) The size of the event will require diversion of so great a number of
police officers of the City to insure that participants stay within the
boundaries or route of the event or to protect participants in the
event as to prevent normal protection to the remainder of the City.
Nothing herein authorizes denial of a permit when additional peace
officers would be available to the City under applicable state law or
mutual aid plans if requested by the City in advance of the event.
Nothing herein authorizes denial of a permit because of the need to
protect participants from the conduct of others if reasonable
permit conditions can be imposed to allow for adequate protection
of event participants with the number of police officers available to
police the event.
(8) The parade or other event moving along a route will not move from
its point of origin to its point of termination in three hours or less.
(9) The location of the event will substantially interfere with any
construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place upon or
along the City streets or along any public right-of-way or where
construction work is scheduled in connection with a previously
granted encroachment permit.
(10) The event shall occur at a time when a school is in session at a
route or location adjacent to the school or class thereof and the
noise created by the activities of the event would substantially
disrupt the educational activities of the school or class thereof.
B. When the grounds for denial of an application for permit specified in
Subsections A(4) through A(10) above can be corrected by altering the
date, time, duration, route, or location of the event, the City
Administrator shall, instead of denying the application, conditionally
approve the application upon the applicant's acceptance of conditions
for permit issuance. The conditions imposed shall provide for only such
modification of the applicant's proposed event as are necessary to
achieve compliance with Subsections A(4) through A(10) above.
A. Alteration of the date, time, route or location of the event proposed on
the event application;
§ 178-7 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 178-8
178:296
§ 178-9. Appeal procedure.
An appeal or review from a denial to grant a permit shall be to the Public

specifically appoints another to act in such capacity.

facts stated to be true.
(2) Upon a showing of good cause, the hearing officer may, in his/her
discretion, permit the filing of an appeal, or an amended appeal,

an amended appeal fails to comply substantially with the requirements
of Subsection A(1)(a) through (e) above, the City Clerk may give written
notice of such insufficiency to the appellant at any time within 15
calendar days after the appeal is presented, stating with particularity
the defects or omissions therein. Failure of the appellant to file an
amended appeal within 15 calendar days of the date of service of such
notice of insufficiency shall constitute a waiver of the appeal. Failure of
the City Clerk to give notice of any insufficiency within 15 calendar days
shall result in the appeal being heard on its merits, without regard to
any insufficiency.
C. Hearing date; notice. Upon receipt of an appeal or, if notice of
insufficiency is given in accordance with Subsection B above, upon
receipt of an amended appeal within the time specified in Subsection B,

for the hearing or in writing prior to the time set for the hearing,
he/she may, in his/her discretion, continue the matter to another
date certain. The City Administrator shall present evidence in
support of the findings or reasons upon which the denial was
based. The appellant, or any individual authorized in writing to
represent him/her, may then present evidence in support of the
§ 178-9 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 178-9

by it in repairing damage to City property occurring in connection with
the permitted event proximately caused by the actions of the permittee/

who was under the permittee's/sponsoring organization's control insofar
as permitted by law. The agreement shall also provide that the permittee/
sponsoring organization shall hold harmless, indemnify and defend the City
of Pleasantville, its officials, members, agents and employees against any
claims, costs, damages, demands, liability and notices, or any of these,
arising or resulting from any damage or injury proximately caused by
actions of the permittee/sponsoring organization in connection with the
permitted event, regardless of whether the City is actively negligent or
passively negligent, except for those claims, costs, damages, demands,
liability and notices, or any of these, caused solely by the negligence or
willful misconduct of the City. Persons who merely join in a parade or event
contentions made in the notice of appeal. The hearing shall be
informally conducted and the technical rules of evidence shall not

be excluded. The Public Safety Committee shall render a decision,
at the conclusion of the hearing, or in writing within 10 working
days thereafter. The Public Safety Committee may affirm, reverse,
modify, or may delete or impose such conditions as the facts and
law warrant. All decisions of the Public Safety Committee shall be

Committee may, in his/her discretion, set aside the default by the
appellant and reschedule the appeal for hearing.
A. Section 178-11 pertaining to indemnification.
B. Section 178-12 pertaining to insurance.

§ 178-9 PARADES AND OTHER SPECIAL EVENTS § 178-11
178:299
are not considered by that reason alone to be under the control of the
permittee/sponsoring organization.
§ 178-12. Insurance.
§ 178-13. Traffic control fees; use of preestablished event routes.
A. The applicant/sponsor of an event must possess or obtain public liability
insurance to protect against loss from liability imposed by law for
damages on account of bodily injury and property damage arising from
the event. Such insurance shall name on the policy or by endorsement
as additional insured the City of Pleasantville, its officers, employees,
and agents. Insurance coverage must be maintained for the duration of
the event. Coverage shall be as follows:
(1) Commercial general liability: $1,000,000.
(2) Automobile liability: $1,000,000.
(3) Workers compensation: Statutory requirements.

necessary endorsements, must be filed with the City Administrator no

insurance policy or certificate of insurance, along with necessary
endorsements, have been filed by the applicant/sponsor and approved
by the City Administrator.
C. The insurance requirements of Subsections A and B above shall be
waived by the City Administrator for nonathletic events if the following
conditions are satisfied:
(1) The applicant or an officer of the sponsoring organization signs a
verified statement that he believes the event's purpose is First
Amendment expression and that he has determined that the cost of
obtaining insurance is so financially burdensome that it would
constitute an unreasonable burden on the right of First Amendment
expression or that it has been impossible to obtain insurance
coverage. The statement shall include the name and address of one
insurance agent or other source for insurance coverage contacted
to determine insurance premium rates for insurance coverage.
(2) The City Administrator may, in his discretion, determine to require
the applicant/sponsor to apply for insurance coverage for the event
under a policy containing the insurance requirements of
Subsections A and B above. The applicant/sponsor must provide
any information pertinent to qualifying for the insurance coverage.

§ 178-11 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 178-13
178:300
§ 178-14. Cleanup deposits for certain special events.
A. Prepayment of fees. Upon approval of an application for a special event
permit, the Chief of Police shall provide the applicant with a statement
of the estimated cost of providing overtime police officers for crowd and
traffic control at the event. The applicant/sponsor of the event shall be
required to prepay the crowd and traffic control fees prior to the
issuance of a special event permit. Traffic and crowd control by officers
includes clearing the event route or site of unauthorized vehicles,
diversion of traffic around the event, and directing pedestrian and
vehicular traffic along the route of an event.
B. Computing traffic control fees. The traffic control fees will be computed
by determining the number of police officers who will be required for
crowd and traffic control in addition to those who would otherwise be
on duty at that time, the number of hours the officers will be on duty for
the event, and the City's full cost of providing officers on an hourly basis
as established by the Police Department fee schedule. In determining
crowd and traffic control fees, the Council shall establish fees upon the
recommendation of the Chief of Police based on the applicant/sponsor's
use of monitors for the event.
C. Refunds or underpayments. If the actual cost for crowd and traffic
control on the date of the event is less than the estimated cost pursuant
to Subsection A above, the applicant/sponsor will be promptly refunded
the difference by the Controller. Should the actual full cost to the City
by reason of the event exceed the estimated cost, the applicant/sponsor
shall pay the balance upon demand by the Controller.
D. Preestablished event routes and fees. The Chief of Police shall
preestablish several event routes within the City of Pleasantville. The
routes shall specify the number of officers assigned for police traffic
control on those routes. The preestablished routes and the fee schedule
for police crowd and traffic control services shall be made available to
the public.
E. Free speech routes and waiver of fees. Crowd and traffic control fees
will be waived by the Chief of Police for nonathletic events if the
following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The applicant/sponsor signs a verified statement that he believes
the event's purpose is First Amendment expression and that the
cost of crowd and traffic control fees is so financially burdensome
that it would constitute an unreasonable burden on the right of
First Amendment expression;
(2) The applicant or sponsor selects one of the preestablished free
speech routes for a parade or other event established by the Chief
of Police.

ARTICLE I
Responsibility for Actions of Minors
[Adopted 6-7-1982 by Ord. No. 11-1982 as Art. I of Ch. 148 of the
1982 Code]
§ 180-1. Purpose.
The Council does find that far too many minors are contributing breaches
of the public peace which, in significant part, are occasioned by a lack
of responsibility on the part of the parents of the minors. Although the
existing statutes do afford a means to alert parents to their responsibilities
to both the minor and society in general, it is considered the opinion and
legislative judgment of the Council that further legislation is necessary to
encourage greater parental concern and responsibility and to fill the void
where traditional parental control is inadequate. This article, pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:48-1, is intended to fill this void.
§ 180-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
MINOR  Any person under the age of 18 years.
PARENT  Either or both parents of a minor, the legal guardians of such
minor or any other person(s) having the care or custody of the minor
committing the violation of the public peace. However, the term "parent"
shall not apply to parents, legal guardians or other persons whose custody
and control over such minor has been removed by court order, decree or
judgment or military service or marriage of such minor.
VIOLATION OF PUBLIC PEACE  Any of the following acts: defacing,
damaging or destroying public property or the private property of another
within the City of Pleasantville; committing an assault or assault and battery
upon another in the city; consuming and/or possessing alcoholic beverages
in a public place in the city; breaking and entering, or entering without
breaking into the property of another with or without the intent to steal or
remove property without the permission of the owner; threatening another
with the intention of extorting money or anything of value to the owner;
possession and/or use of a controlled dangerous substance, as the same
shall be defined under Title 24 of the Revised Statutes of New Jersey;98
behaving in such a manner as to create a real or implied threat of harm
to another individual by threatening gestures and/or words that denote
physical threat; the use of abusive or obscene language; the use of one's
voice, instrument or device in a manner so as to deprive one of quiet
enjoyment; harassment of any individual, family or business in the city
(harassment: to trouble by repeated attacks; incursions; to disturb
persistently); or, while on public property, the operating of or riding upon
any minibike, motorcycle or other motor vehicle for which the operator

does not have in his possession a current registration, a valid driver's
license or a current insurance card as required by N.J.S.A. 39:3-29; or to
demand, request or encourage another or others to commit any of the
aforementioned acts or violations or any other act covered by N.J.S.A.
2A:14-1 et seq. relating to juvenile behavior.
§ 180-3. Violation notice.
In order for a parent to violate § 180-4 of this article utilizing the
terminology "allow," "permit" or "suffer" where a minor is apprehended
and convicted of a violation of the public peace, the Chief of Police in
the city or his designated agent shall forthwith serve written notice of
the act and conviction on the parent, a copy of which shall be forwarded
to the Pleasantville Juvenile Conference Committee. If at any time within
180 days of the giving of such notice such minor shall again be charged
and thereafter be subsequently convicted of the same classification of the
violation of the public peace, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the parent
allowed, permitted or suffered said minor to commit a violation of the public
peace.
§ 180-4. Parental involvement in unlawful acts prohibited.
It shall be unlawful for any parent to assist, aid, abet, allow, permit, suffer
or encourage a minor to commit a violation of the public peace as defined
herein, either by overt act, by failure to act or by lack of supervision and
control over such minor.
§ 180-5. Violations and penalties.99
Any person violating or failing to comply with any of the provisions of this
article shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to a fine of not less than
$100 nor more than $1,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 90 days
and/or a period of community service not exceeding 90 days. Each day such
violation is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate
offense and shall be punishable as such.
§ 180-6. Cumulative remedies.
The remedy provision of this article shall not be exclusive, and the state or
any other person shall have the right to proceed under any other legally
available remedies.

Civil Liability
[Adopted 6-7-1982 by Ord. No. 11-1982 as Art. II of Ch. 148 of the
1982 Code]
§ 180-7. Purpose.
The Council of the City of Pleasantville finds that malicious acts of
vandalism by youths are increasing at an alarming rate; that such acts are
frequently attributable to lack of care, custody and control exercised by
the parent; that parents should have some responsibility for the conduct of
their children; and that while there is a reluctance to charge a child with
juvenile delinquency there should be some legal deterrent to juvenile acts
of vandalism and to parental neglect of child supervision.
§ 180-8. Supervision and control of minors.
Any parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of a minor
16 years of age or under who fails or neglects to exercise responsible
supervision and control of the conduct of such minor shall be liable in a civil
action for the willful, malicious or unlawful injury or destruction by such
minor of the real or personal property of another.
§ 180-9. Civil damages imputed to parents.
The act of misconduct as set forth in § 180-8 hereof shall be imputed for all
purposes of civil damages to the parent, parents or legal guardian having
custody of the minor.
§ 180-10. Actual damages limited.100
The joint and several liability of one or both parents or of the legal guardian
for any one act of willful misconduct under this article shall be limited to
actual damages.
§ 180-11. Cumulative remedies.
The remedy provisions of this article shall be cumulative, not exclusive, and
the state or any other concerned person shall have the right to proceed
under any other legally available remedies.

(8) Where the Inspecting Official, after hearing, shall determine that
there was a violation and a notice was served upon the owner,
operator or occupant, whether or not said violation was abated
prior to the issuance of an order, if thereafter within the space of
one year there shall be a second violation by the same owner,
operator or occupant of the same provision of this article
discovered on the same premises, the offender may be prosecuted
on the second violation without the Inspecting Official first giving
notice and opportunity for a hearing to the owner, operator or
occupant by the filing of a complaint by the Inspecting Official in
the Municipal Court. Where the Inspecting Official has on two
different occasions found violations by the same owner, operator or
occupant on the same premises and has issued notices on each and

The repeal of any provisions of any other ordinances by this article shall not
affect any action for prosecution or abatement under any such ordinance or

other steps of enforcement have been taken or are being taken within any
administrative agency or in the Municipal Court for enforcement thereof.
§ 207-10. Inspector's powers and duties. [Amended 2-17-1999 by
Ord. No. 6-1999]
providing notice and opportunity for a hearing by the Inspecting
Official.
(9) Effect of notice on owner. For the purposes of enforcement of this
article, the service of a notice on an owner, whether or not the
owner is also the operator, shall constitute notice of violations set
forth therein until said violations are abated in conformity with this
article and the other applicable ordinances of the City of
Pleasantville.
A. Fines for violations. A violator of any section or subsection of this article
shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $5,000 or 90 days in jail, at
the discretion of the Judge of the Municipal Court, for each violation
committed hereunder. [Amended 2-17-1999 by Ord. No. 6-1999]
B. Meaning of "each violation." Each violation of a section or subsection of
this article shall constitute a separate and distinct violation
independent of any other section or subsection. Each day's failure to
comply with any such section or subsection shall constitute a separate
violation.
C. Application to officers or agents. Where the defendant is other than a
natural person or persons, Subsections A and B shall also apply to any
agent, superintendent, officer, member or partner who shall alone or
with others have charge or control of the premises.
A. Adoption of rules and regulations by Inspecting Official. The Inspecting
Official is hereby authorized and empowered to promulgate such
written rules and regulations as may be necessary for the proper
interpretation and administration of the provisions of this article,
provided that such rules and regulations do not conflict with this article
and conform to the general standards prescribed by this article. The
Inspecting Official shall file copies of such rules and regulations with
the City Clerk, Health Officer, City Engineer and Fire Chief and shall
make available in the Inspecting Official's office a copy for inspection by
members of the public during regular business hours. Such rules and
regulations shall have the approval of the Health Officer, City Engineer
§ 207-7 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 207-10
203:388
and Fire Chief, respectively, where the provisions thereof relate to
matters which are also in the jurisdiction of and supervision of each
officer. In case of conflict, the rule or regulation may be promulgated
by direction of the Mayor. Such rules and regulations shall have the
same force and effect as the provisions of this article, and the violations
thereof shall be enforced as violations of the express provisions of this
article, as herein provided.
B. Premises located in area of expected public action. The Inspecting
Official shall have the power to modify the strict enforcement of this
article where premises subject to this article are contemplated for
acquisition or are within an area where acquisition is contemplated by a
public agency having the power of eminent domain, and there is a
reasonable likelihood that said premises will be acquired within a
period of two years, and the strict enforcement of the provisions of this
article would require repairs and improvements estimated to exceed
$5,000 in cost, and there is an alternative means satisfactory to the
Inspecting Official to be used which will eliminate violations of this
article constituting hazards to the health, safety and welfare of the
occupants of the premises and persons in the immediate vicinity
thereof; provided, however, that any waiver of the provisions of this
article permitted under this subsection shall be canceled, and the
Inspecting Official shall strictly enforce the article if it shall be
ascertained subsequent to the granting of the waiver that the premises
are in fact not to be acquired for any public use or purpose.
Notwithstanding the above, no such waiver granted shall be in violation
of any laws of the State of New Jersey or any other public body.
C. Right to hearing where application denied. Upon denial of any such
application, the owner, operator or occupant may request a hearing
with the Board of Appeals for the Building, Housing and Maintenance
Codes of the City of Pleasantville, which shall be held in accordance
with procedures of said Board.
(1) Application not to constitute a defense or stay. Such application
shall not constitute a defense of any violation of this article
concerning which any proceedings are pending in the Municipal
Court when the application is filed, nor shall any variance or
modification allowed hereunder constitute a vested right against
any ordinance enacted hereinafter by the City Council compelling
strict enforcement of any provisions of this article.
(2) Record of variations or modifications granted. Where variations or
modifications of any section of this article are approved by the
Board of Appeals for the Building, Housing and Maintenance Codes
of the City of Pleasantville, or by action of any court, a written
record thereof stating the name of the applicant, the address of the
premises, the variation or, modification approved, the date of
approval and the reasons therefor, satisfying the provisions
contained herein, shall be prepared by the Inspecting Official and
filed both under the section or sections of this article to which the
§ 207-10 POOL AND BILLIARD PARLORS § 207-10
203:389
variation or modification applies and under the address of the
premises, and such files shall be available for public inspection in
the office of the Inspecting Official during regular business hours.
D. Annual review of article provisions and related activity. The Inspecting
Official shall, in the month of December of each year, review with the
Fire Chief, Health Officer, City Engineer and the City Counsel, the
procedure and operation of this article and report to the Mayor and City

(1) Any recommended amendment, addition or modification of
provisions of this article consonant with the field experience of the
personnel charged with enforcement.
(2) A summary of the enforcement experience, indicating number of
violations abated, number of cases processed in the Municipal
Court, number of inspections made and such other and further
pertinent information as will provide the Mayor and City Council
with an annual account of progress in securing the standards
required by this article.
(3) Any further recommendation as to how this article and the
procedure and operations thereunder can be improved.

good operating condition and to make all necessary repairs and
replacements. Such meters shall be accessible to employees and
other authorized representatives of the city for reading, testing,
inspection or repair. If the owner, being required so to do, shall fail
to furnish or install a meter or meters or shall fail to maintain the
same, then, in any such case, after 10 days' written notice by the
Plumbing Subcode Official to perform such obligation, said
Inspector may enter onto such property to install such meter or
repair and maintain the same, as the case may be, and charge the
cost thereof to such owner. Bills for such installation or repair, if
made by the city, shall be due and payable immediately upon
completion of the work and shall be collected in the same manner
as bills for sewer service charges.

and on a waterline used solely for lawn sprinkling, car washing, the
filling of swimming pools and other similar purposes, including a
commercial use, provided that the water so used is not discharged
in the public sewer system. The quantity of water so used and not
discharged into the public sewer system must be measured by a
separate meter installed by the owner as otherwise provided for all
other water meters. All requirements of Subsection F(1) shall
herein apply.
(4) Any customer having a swimming pool, who does not utilize a
separate meter as provided in Subsection F(3), may apply for a
permit to fill the swimming pool with water. Thereafter, upon

Superintendent of Public Works.
(5) Any industrial user may, subject to approval by the City Engineer,
install an adequate metering system so as to determine the amount
of water used that is not discharged in the public sewer system,
which shall then be excluded from sewer charges. In the
alternative, an industrial user may, subject to the approval of the
City Engineer, install an adequate metering system so as to
determine the amount of water that is discharged into the public
sewer system, and the same shall be included in the sewer charges,
but all other water utilized but not discharged into the public sewer
system, such industrial installations shall be subject to inspection
upon installation and biannually thereafter, by the city's Water
Pollution Superintendent, to confirm compliance with this chapter,

which such sewer is or should be connected the same as taxes upon
real estate, and the same charges of interest, costs and penalties
shall be imposed by the city for nonpayment of said charges for
sewer service as are imposed and fixed by law in the city for the
collection of taxes upon real estate.
(3) Council may direct that the sewer service furnished shall be cut off
and terminated; provided, however, that prior to cutting off said
sewer service, five days' notice shall be given to the tenant, owner
or person in charge of the premises to which such service is
furnished that unless said charges are paid within five days from
the date of the notice, the sewer service will be cut off and
terminated. The mailing of said notice addressed to the tenant,
owner or person in charge of the property shall be a sufficient
service thereof.
B. In the event that sewer service is cut off in any case, the applicant shall
prepay actual cost of reconnection.

ARTICLE I
Regulation of Stormwater Runoff from Development
[Adopted 6-6-1988 by Ord. No. 14-1988]
§ 251-1. Title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Stormwater
Management article.
§ 251-2. Statement of purpose.
It is hereby determined that the lakes and waterways within the City of
Pleasantville of Atlantic County are subject to flooding; that development
tends to accentuate such flooding by increasing stormwater runoff, due to
alteration of the hydrologic response of the watershed in changing from
the undeveloped to the developed condition; that such increased flooding
produced by development of real property contributes increased quantities
of waterborne pollutants and tends to increase channel erosion; that such
increased flooding, increased erosion and increased pollution constitutes
deterioration of the water resources of the City of Pleasantville, the county
and the state; and that such increase in flooding, increased erosion and
increased pollution can be controlled to some extent by the regulation of
stormwater runoff from such development. It is determined that it is in the
public interest to regulate the development of real property and to establish
standards to regulate the additional discharge of stormwater runoff from
such developments as provided in this article.
§ 251-3. Applicability.
The criteria within this article are applicable to all site and subdivision plans
that require approval by the Municipal Planning or Zoning Boards.153
§ 251-4. Goals and objectives.
In order to protect, maintain and enhance both the immediate and longterm
health and general welfare of its citizens, Pleasantville established the
following goals and objectives for stormwater control:
A. To ensure that stormwater runoff after development of a site will
approximate the same rate of flow and timing of stormwater runoff that
would have occurred under predevelopment conditions.
B. To maintain the adequacy of existing and proposed culverts and
bridges, dams and other conveyance structures.
C. To minimize, to the greatest extent possible, the transport of pollutants
to receiving waters necessary for the preservation of the chemical,
physical and biological integrity of those waters.
153. Editor's Note: See Arts. XII, XIV and XV of Chapter 290, Zoning and Land Use.
§ 251-1 SIGNS, TEMPORARY § 251-4
243:455
§ 251-5. Administrative procedure.
§ 251-6. Required submissions.
The following submissions shall be required for a proposed project under
review:
D. To minimize erosion and sedimentation from any development or
construction project.
A. Burden of proof. Whenever an applicant seeks a municipal approval of a
development to which this article is applicable from any board or
official of the municipality, that applicant shall be required to
demonstrate that his project meets the standards set forth in this
article.
B. Submission materials due. The applicant shall submit materials, as
required by § 251-6 hereof, to the municipal board or official from
which he seeks municipal approval prior to or at the same time he
submits his application for municipal approval.
C. Review of project. The applicant's project shall be reviewed by the
municipal board or official from which he seeks his municipal approval.
That municipal board or official shall consult with the Municipal
Engineer to determine if the project meets the standards set forth in
this article.
D. Time for decision. The municipal board or official shall promptly
determine if the project meets the standards set forth in this article.
The time for that determination should be the time permitted to review
and act on the applicant's application for a municipal approval.
E. Failure to comply. Failure of the applicant to demonstrate that the
project meets the standards set forth in this article is reason to deny the
applicant's underlying application for a municipal approval.
F. Variance. For good reason, the municipality maintains the right to grant
a waiver of the standards given in § 251-7 below.
A. Topographic base map. A topographic base map of the site extending
200 feet beyond the limits of the proposed development at a scale of
one inch equals 200 feet shall display two-foot contour intervals;
existing surface water drainage; marsh lands; outlines of woodland
cover; existing, natural and man-made features; roads; utilities; and
bearings and distances of property lines.
B. Vicinity map. Preparation of a map at the scale of one inch equals 400
feet will reflect the site of the proposed development, access to the site
and surface date reflected from United States Geological Survey Quads
and Soils Maps.
§ 251-4 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 251-6
243:456
§ 251-7. Design standards.
Each proposed project not exempted from the operation of this article shall
meet the following storm drainage standards:
C. Environmental site analysis. A written and graphic description of the
site shall include existing soil conditions, slope factors, wetlands,
vegetation and animal life. Particular attention should be given to
unique features of the site.
D. Water detention facilities map. The following information shall be
illustrated on a map of the same scale as the topographic base map:
(1) The total area to be impervious or built-upon, the estimated land
area to be occupied by water-retention or -detention facilities and
the type of vegetation thereon, and details of the proposed plan to
control and dispose of surface water.
(2) Details of all water-retention or -detention plans, during and after
construction, including discharge provisions, discharge capacity
and spillway provisions, where applicable.
A. General standards. The project plans submitted shall demonstrate
careful consideration of the general and specific concerns, values and
standards of the Municipal Master Plan and applicable county, regional
and state storm drainage control programs and any County Mosquito
Commission control standards and shall be based on environmentally
sound site planning, engineering and architectural techniques.
B. Alternatives to detention basins.
(1) Basin requirements may also be satisfied the following ways:
Tanks, infiltration pits, dry wells or gravel layers underneath
paving may be used for the purpose, with appropriate
consideration for length of life and feasibility of continued
maintenance.
(2) Nonstructural management practices, such as cluster land use
development, open space acquisition, stream encroachment and
flood hazard controls should be coordinated with detention
requirements. Changes in land use can often reduce the scope and
cost of detention provisions required by means of appropriate
changes in runoff coefficients.
C. Specific standards.
(1) Detention basins.
(a) A detention facility must accommodate the volume of site
runoff generated from a two-year, five-year, ten-year and
twenty-five-year twenty-four-hour storm considered
individually (in each case, a Type III rainfall as defined in Soil
Conservation Service Publications, Technical Release No. 55).
§ 251-6 SIGNS, TEMPORARY § 251-7
243:457
Runoff greater than that occurring from a twenty-five-year
twenty-four-hour storm will be passed over an emergency
spillway. Detention will be provided such that, after
development, neither the peak rate of flow from the site nor
the total flow during the hour of maximum release will exceed
the corresponding flows which would have been created by a
similar storm prior to development.
(b) The water quality design storm for dry detention basins shall
be defined as a one-year frequency Soil Conservation Service
Type III twenty-four-hour storm or a one-and-one-fourth-inch
two-hour rainfall. The outlet from the detention facility must
require that the runoff from a settleability design storm be
retained such that not more than 90% will be evacuated prior
to 36 hours for all nonresidential projects or 18 hours for all
residential projects. The retention time shall begin at the time
of peak storage. Retention will not be required in any case to
an extent which would reduce the outlet size to a diameter of
three inches or less.
(c) Multiple level outlets or other fully automatic outlets shall be
designed so that discharge rates from the developed condition
will not exceed the predevelopment runoff rate for a two- , five-
, ten- or twenty-five-year storm considered individually. Outlet
waters shall be discharged from the development at such
locations and velocities as not to cause additional erosion.
(d) Outlets from detention facilities shall be designed to function
without manual, electric or mechanical controls.
(e) In many instances, the provisions of separate detention
facilities for a number of single sites may be more expensive
and difficult to maintain than provisions of joint facilities for a
number of sites. In such cases, the municipality will be willing
to consider provisions of joint detention facilities which will
fulfill the requirements of this regulation. In such cases, a
properly planned staged program of detention facilities may be
approved by the municipality in which compliance with some
requirements may be postponed at early stages while
preliminary phases are being undertaken and construction
funds accumulated.
(f) If detention basins are provided through which water passes at
times other than following rainfall, the Municipal Engineer
should be consulted concerning design criteria. It will be
necessary for detention requirements to be met, despite the
necessity of passing certain low flows. This applies to all online
detention basins.
§ 251-7 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 251-7
243:458
(g) Soil borings must be made at least five feet below the lowest
invert of the basin bottom. Two soil borings will be required
per facility.
(h) Where the project consists of two phases, (a) new construction
which required provisions of storm drainage under the terms
of this article and (b) repair or rehabilitation of structures and
surfaces which does not result in increasing the extent of
impervious areas or in rendering existing surfaces less
pervious, the detention requirements may be computed on the
basis of Phase (a) exclusively.
(i) Soil within the recharge system shall be protected with filter
fabric during construction; then, when site construction is
complete, the filter fabric will be removed and basin soils
stabilized.
(j) The location of a detention facility shall be in an area with
seasonal high water a minimum of 1.5 feet below the lowest
invert elevation of the facility.
(k) A low flow channel shall be incorporated into the detention
basin to prevent broad area ponding.
(2) Stabilized access 20 feet wide is to be provided to the detention
facility capable of supporting maintenance vehicles.
(3) Retention-infiltration basin.
(a) A retention basin system must accommodate stormwater
runoff so that the minimum rate of percolation of the soil is 15
minutes per inch, which allows infiltration of 36 inches of
runoff over a three-day period from the basin.
(b) One soil boring shall be required for each 1,000 square feet of
all retention stormwater facilities. All borings must extend 10
feet below the lowest invert elevation of the proposed
stormwater facility.
(c) The location of a retention facility shall be in an area with
seasonal high water a minimum of two feet below the lowest
invert elevation of the facility. Furthermore, the bottom of any
proposed basin shall be at least five feet above any impervious
soil formations found in the soil logs; otherwise, the impervious
layer shall be penetrated at required intervals.
(d) Sediment traps must be located such that all inflowing
stormwater be treated before entering any subsurface
recharge system.
(e) Soil within the recharge system shall be protected with filter
fabric during construction; then, when site construction is

243:459
complete, the filter fabric shall be removed and basin soils
stabilized.
(f) A low flow channel shall be incorporated into the retention
basin to prevent broad area ponding.
(g) Stabilized access 20 feet wide is to be provided to the retention
facility capable of supporting maintenance vehicles.
(h) The retention of site runoff as required by this article will
result in the accumulation of sediment, including particulate,
silt and debris. Provision must be made for periodic removal of
accumulated solid materials, such that the basin continues to
operate as designed.
(i) Infiltration practices, such as dry wells, infiltration basins,
infiltration trenches, buffer strips, etc., may be used to satisfy
this requirement, provided that they produce zero runoff from
the water quality design storm and allow for complete
infiltration within 36 hours.
(4) Detention/retention facilities in flood hazard areas.
(a) Whenever practicable, developments and their stormwater
facility basins should be beyond the extent of Zone A5 flood
hazard boundary. When this is not possible and facility basins
are located partially or wholly within Zone A5 (as defined by
New Jersey Division of Water Resources, Bureau of Flood Plain
Management), some storm conditions will make the facility
ineffective at providing retention of site runoff. This will
happen if the stream is already overflowing its banks and the
basin, causing the basin to be filled prior to the time it is
needed for containment of runoff. In such cases, the standards
established in these regulations will be modified in order to
give only partial credit to detention capacities located within
the A5 Zone. The credit will vary in ratio intended to reflect the
probability that storage will be available at the time a storm
occurs at the site.
(b) Stormwater runoff storage parameters shall be based upon the
location and elevation of said facility. If a facility is located on
the edge or within the base flood elevation (A5 Zone), the
following criteria shall be used to determine effective storage:
[1] When the bottom of the stormwater facility is less than two
feet below the base flood elevation, a storage volume of
2 1/2 times the calculated site runoff storage volume must
be accommodated by the basin.
[2] When the bottom of the stormwater facility is between two
feet and four feet below base flood elevation, a storage
§ 251-7 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 251-7
243:460
§ 251-8. Calculation methods and supplementary standards.
volume of 10 times the calculated site runoff storage
volume must be provided by the basin.
[3] When the bottom of said facility is four feet or more below
of the base flood elevation, a storage volume of 10 times
the calculated site runoff storage volume must be provided
by the basin.
(c) As an alternative approach to the above criteria, if the
developer can demonstrate that the detention provided would
be effective during runoff from the twenty-five-year twentyfour-
hour Type III storm, peaking simultaneously at the site
and on the flood hazard area, his plan will be accepted as
complying with provisions in the above set criteria.
(5) Landscaping. All detention and retention-infiltration basins shall be
landscaped in the following manner:
(a) Detention basins. All grassed areas shall be sodded into place.
(b) Retention-infiltration basins. Grassed area requirements for
retention-infiltration basins are identical to those of detention
basins in all respects.
(6) Basin design. Design of both detention and retention-infiltration
basin will be the same except for outlet design for detention basins.
(a) Side slopes of all basins shall not exceed three to one.
(b) All basins must maximize the distance between inflow and
outflow.
(c) At inflow point to basins, energy dissipaters should be
incorporated to reduce the velocity of inflowing waters.
(d) Design of facility should be based upon peak rates of runoff for
the entire drainage area upstream from the parcel in question
and design release rates computed on the basis of preexisting
conditions for the entire watershed.
A. Detention facilities. For the purpose of determining the total quantity of
runoff prior to and following development, the applicant shall utilize the
Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release No. 55 (TR-55). This
methodology shall serve as the basis for determining total storage
capacity required subject to the guidelines identified in previous
sections of this report and will also serve as the basis for determining
release rates from the two- , five- , ten- and twenty-five-year storms.
B. Calculations shall be computed on the basis of all areas upstream of the
parcel(s) in question. Peak rates of runoff shall be computed for the
§ 251-7 SIGNS, TEMPORARY § 251-8
243:461
entire area and design release rates computed on the basis of
preexisting conditions for the entire watershed.

percent of impervious cover, alterations of hydraulic length and
percentage of watershed as wetland as described in TR-55 and
supplemented by notes provided by the Soil Conservation Service.
Either the tabular method described in TR-55 or the charts
contained in Appendix D of TR-55 shall be used.
(2) Total quantity of runoff utilizing the tabular hydrographic data
contained in TR-55. Total quantities of runoff shall be estimated
prior to and after development by calculating total area under the
hydrograph utilizing hydographic coefficients contained in TR-55.
(3) The relative timing of the peak rate of discharge following onset of
a storm, which shall be identified within the stormwater
calculations.
F. Methods and standards.
(1) For storm sewer design, the rational method may be utilized for
calculating runoff quantities subject to the following criteria:
Design requirements for storm sewers shall be the ten-year storm.
Runoff generated by storms of greater intensity (up to and
§ 251-8 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 251-8
243:462
including the twenty-five-year storm) shall be directed towards
detention basins or alternative stormwater facilities on the site.

§ 251-14. Scope and purpose.
A. Policy Statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural BMPs. Structural BMPs should be
integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and
proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater
recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for "major
development," as defined in § 251-15.
C. Applicability.
(1) This article shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for
the following major developments that require preliminary or final
site plan or subdivision review:
(a) Nonresidential major developments; and
(b) Aspects of residential major developments that are not
preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) This article shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the City of Pleasantville.
D. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant
to this article are to be considered an integral part of development
approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule,
act, or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this article shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This article
is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinances, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law except
that, where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different

D.
A. Design and performance standards for stormwater management
measures.
(1) Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
standards in § 251-17. To the maximum extent practicable, these
standards shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies into the design. If these strategies alone
are not sufficient to meet these standards, structural stormwater
management measures necessary to meet these standards shall be
incorporated into the design.
(2) The standards in this article apply only to new major development
and are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on
water quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and
maintain groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new
major development to the extent that alternative design and
performance standards are applicable under a regional stormwater
management plan or water quality management plan adopted in

§ 251-17. Stormwater management requirements for major
development.
accordance with Department rules. The stormwater management
requirements within this article, as they relate to major
development supercede other design requirements stipulated in
the City Code, including but not limited to the following sections:
(a) City Chapter 290, Zoning and Land Use.
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a
major development in accordance with § 251-23.
B. Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of
concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered species as
documented in the Department's Landscape Project or Natural
Heritage Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-15.147 through
15.150, particularly Helonias bullata (swamp pink) and/or Clemmys
muhlnebergi (bog turtle).
C. The following linear development projects are exempt from the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater
runoff quality requirements of Subsections F and G.
(1) The construction of an underground utility line, provided that the
disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion;
(2) The construction of an aboveground utility line, provided that the
existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements of Subsections F and G may be obtained for the
enlargement of an existing public roadway or railroad or the
construction or enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided
that the following conditions are met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates through an alternatives analysis that,
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of Subsections F and G to the
maximum extent practicable;
§ 251-16 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 251-17
243:472
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of Subsections F and G, existing structures currently in use, such
as homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above within
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would
provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of
Subsections F and G that were not achievable on site.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Subsections F
and G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth at Subsection E into the design.
The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures
incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant
contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental, or
safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater
management measures identified in Subsection E(2) below into the
design of a particular project, the applicant shall identify the
strategy considered and provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:
(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;
(d) Minimize the decrease in the time of concentration from

hydraulically most distant point of the watershed to the point
of interest within a watershed;
(e) Minimize land disturbance including clearing and grading;
(f) Minimize soil compaction;
(g) Provide low-maintenance landscaping that encourages

discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;
§ 251-17 SIGNS, TEMPORARY § 251-17
243:473
(i) Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site, in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
[1] Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that satisfy Subsection E(3) below;
[2] Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash
and debris from drainage systems;

spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and
[4] When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
(3) Site design features identified under Subsection E(2)(i)[2] above
shall comply with the following standard to control passage of solid

this paragraph, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment,
debris, trash, and other floating, suspended, or settleable solids.
For exemptions to this standard see Subsection E(3)(c) below.
(a) Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm
drain or surface water body under that grate:
[1] The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways
Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
[2] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square inches, or
is no greater than 0.5 inches across the smallest

§ 251-17 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 251-17
243:474
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches, or be no greater
than two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in Subsection G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Subsections F and
G shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate county clerk's
office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 251-20, or found on the Department's Web

F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 251-18, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area, or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department-approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
§ 251-17 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 251-17
243:476
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 251-18, complete one of the
following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
§ 251-17 SIGNS, TEMPORARY § 251-17
243:477
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to
be constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsections F(1)(c)[1],
F(1)(c)[2] and F(1)(c)[3] above shall only be applied if the
increased volume of stormwater runoff could increase
flood damages below the point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at § 251-15 shall be submitted to
the appropriate soil conservation district for review and approval in
accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable soil conservation district guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this
section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,
expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of
rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 251-20, or found on the Department's Web
site at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources
of technical guidance are listed in § 251-20. TSS reduction shall be
calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2
below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
§ 251-17 SIGNS, TEMPORARY § 251-17
243:479
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, PO Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey, 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (A x B)/100
Where:
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP
Table 2: TSS Removal Rates for BMPs
Best Management Practice
TSS Percent Removal
Rate
Bioretention systems 90
Constructed stormwater wetland 90
Extended detention basin 40-60
Infiltration structure 80
Manufactured treatment device See § 251-19C
Sand filter 80
Vegetative filter strip 60-80
Wet pond 50-90
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Subsections F and G.

243:480
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 251-20.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top-of-bank of the waterway or center
line of the waterway where the bank is undefined. All
encroachments proposed under this subparagraph shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil
§ 251-17 SIGNS, TEMPORARY § 251-17
243:481
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under
the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et
seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under the Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS
postconstruction removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and soil conservation district
staff to identify necessary stabilization measures; and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to Subsection G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in Subsection G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall
a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
special water resource protection area to less than 150 feet as
§ 251-17 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 251-17

recharge.
measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology and
Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds;
or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at Subsection A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at Subsection A(1)(b). A runoff
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption
prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover have
existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the
time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the
presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the
land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land
use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and
conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
§ 251-17 SIGNS, TEMPORARY § 251-18
243:483
§ 251-19. Standards for structural stormwater management
measures.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32, A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New

A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
§ 251-18 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 251-19
243:484
§ 251-20. Sources for technical guidance.
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of § 251-21D.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosion
resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
§ 251-21.
B. Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
stormwater management measures may be utilized, provided the
design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its
design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater
recharge and water quality design and performance standards
established by § 251-17 of this article.
C. Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements
of § 251-17 of this article, provided the pollutant removal rates are
verified by the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and
certified by the Department.

the proper design and operation of stormwater management basins.
This section applies to any new stormwater management basin.
B. Requirements for trash racks, overflow grates and escape provisions.
(1) A trash rack is a device designed to catch trash and debris and
prevent the clogging of outlet structures. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet from the stormwater
management basin to ensure proper functioning of the basin
outlets in accordance with the following:
(a) The trash rack shall have parallel bars, with no greater than
six-inch spacing between the bars.
(b) The trash rack shall be designed so as not to adversely affect
the hydraulic performance of the outlet pipe or structure.
(c) The average velocity of flow through a clean trash rack is not to
exceed 2.5 feet per second under the full range of stage and
discharge. Velocity is to be computed on the basis of the net
area of opening through the rack.
(d) The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be rigid,
durable, and corrosion resistant, and shall be designed to
withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.

Reference to articles or sections hereinafter refer to said state highway
specifications.
A. Trenches shall be backfilled in layers not to exceed six inches and a
vibratory tamper must be used. Ninety-five-percent compaction shall be
required. Puddling of backfill is strictly prohibited. Should there be a
deficiency, additional backfill material shall be supplied by the
permittee. Whenever the City Engineer shall deem the material
unsatisfactory for backfill, the permittee shall provide acceptable
material for the backfill.
B. Roadways with a concrete base shall be restored using a combination of
concrete and asphalt. The amount of concrete and asphalt to be used at
each such excavation shall be as directed by the City Engineer. (See
detail at end of chapter.)
C. Bituminous concrete street restoration specifications.
(1) Gravel. Gravel shall be installed six inches thick. The gravel shall
consist of compact soil aggregate Type I-5. The use of a recycled
asphalt product (RAP) or recycled concrete product may be
substituted for the soil aggregate as long as it meets the New
Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) requirements for I-5
materials. The City Engineer may, at his discretion, submit samples
of the soil aggregate for a gradation analysis, with the costs of said
analysis borne by the applicant.
(2) Temporary roadway restoration.
(a) Less than 100 square feet.
[1] For openings in asphalt roadways that are less than 100
square feet, the temporary restoration will consist of the
installation of six inches of soil aggregate, Type I-5, to a
level of six inches below the level of adjacent paved
surfaces. A four-inch lift of stabilized base course, Mix I-2,
followed by a two-inch lift of a bituminous concrete cold
patch shall be installed to grade.
[2] These temporary surfaces shall be in place for a period of
not less than 45 days to allow sufficient settlement to
occur. Should settlement continue to occur, the City
Engineer shall determine when the work is acceptable for
final restoration. The permittee shall be responsible for all
maintenance deemed necessary by the City Engineer until
such time as the final restoration is completed.
(b) Greater than 100 square feet.
[1] For openings in asphalt roadways that are greater than
100 square feet, the temporary restoration will consist of
the installation of six inches of soil aggregate, Type I-5, to
§ 255-20 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 255-20
243:508
a level six inches below the level of the adjacent paved
surfaces. A six-inch lift of stabilized base course, Mix I-2,
shall then be installed to grade.
[2] These temporary surfaces shall be left in place for a period
of not less than 45 days to allow sufficient settlement to
occur. Should settlement continue to occur, the City
Engineer shall determine when the work is acceptable for
final restoration. The permittee shall be responsible for all
maintenance deemed necessary by the City Engineer until
such time as the final restoration is completed.
(3) Final roadway restoration.
(a) Newly paved streets.
[1] In the event that an emergency or hardship requires the
opening of a roadway that has been resurfaced by the City
during the previous five years pursuant to § 255-18, a fullwidth
restoration will be required. The restoration will
consist of six-inch dense graded aggregate base course,
and a six-inch bituminous stabilized base course, Mix I-2,
brought to existing grade, within the excavated area. A full
width, curb to curb, milling two inches in depth to extend
20 feet beyond the limit of excavations will be performed
after proper settlement in the trench area. The allowable
time for the settlement shall be 45 days unless otherwise
directed by the City Engineer. The final surface course
shall be a two-inch bituminous concrete surface course,
Mix I-5. (See detail at end of chapter.)
[2] Trench restoration may be permitted under special
circumstances and at the option of the City of Pleasantville
and City Engineer for openings having a minimum impact
on the longevity and serviceability of the street in
question. (See detail at end of chapter.)
(b) Streets paved between five and eight years prior to proposed
opening.
[1] Any street opening on a street that has been constructed,
reconstructed, or overlaid between five years and eight
years after the completion of said construction,
reconstruction, or overlay will require a half-width paving
from the center line to the curb on the side affected by the
opening. The trench shall be repaved with six inches of
gravel or similar subbase, four-inch stabilized base (HMA
19M64) to the surface. The half width of the street shall
then be milled 1 1/2 inches deep from the center line to the
curbline a distance of 20 feet on either side of the opening
edges. A one-and-one-half-inch surface course (HMA
9.5M64) shall be machine-placed and rolled as per New
§ 255-20 SIGNS, TEMPORARY § 255-20
243:509
Jersey Department of Transportation Standard
Specifications for Roads and Bridges, 2007, and as
amended.
[2] If the opening crosses over the center line of the street,
the above street repair shall be full-width restoration.
(c) Streets paved over eight years prior to proposed opening.
[1] Where 20% or more of the existing surface width and/or a
distance parallel or longitudinal to the roadway center line
of 25 feet or more has been disturbed, the permittee shall
mill the entire pavement surface from edge to edge or curb
to curb and the full length of the trench plus five feet each
side at a minimum depth of two inches. All milling and
disposal of millings shall be done in accordance with
Division 400 of the NJDOT Standard Specifications. The
permittee shall clean and sweep the milled surface and
apply tack coat in preparation for immediate paving. The
area will then be paved with two inches of HMA 9.5M64
surface course in accordance with Division 400 of the
NJDOT Standard Specifications. The City will require that
the terminal ends of the paving be keyed and cut vertical
to provide a smooth transition to the existing asphalt
surface. Feathering will not be allowed.
[2] Where less than 20% of the existing surface and a distance
parallel or longitudinal to the roadway center line of less
than 25 feet has been disturbed, the permittee shall
sawcut the existing surface course two inches deep at a
location 12 inches beyond the trench surface, and remove
the existing pavement to the same depth. Pavement
removal shall be done by milling or another method as
approved by the City Engineer. The permittee shall clean
and sweep the milled surface and apply tack coat in
preparation for immediate paving. The area will then be
paved with two inches of HMA 9.5M64 surface course in
accordance with Division 400 of the NJDOT Standard
Specifications. The Township will require that the terminal
ends of the paving be keyed and cut vertical to provide a
smooth transition to the existing asphalt surface.
Feathering will not be allowed.
(d) Calculating age of street.

calculated from December 31 of the year in which said
road was constructed, reconstructed or overlaid and run
five years thereafter. The end date of this five-year period
is the beginning date of the five-year to eight-year period

length, a single trench must be used rather than the individual
excavations. Final restoration will require the entire pavement
surface from edge to edge or curb to curb and the full length of the
trench plus five feet each side at a minimum depth of two inches.
All edges shall be coated with an asphaltic tack coat prior to a twoinch
lift of bituminous concrete surface course, Mix I-5, being
placed to a level even with the existing road grade.
(5) In all cases where concrete has to be removed prior to any
excavation, saw cut methods of removal shall be used. The

so to pay on demand any cost or expense that the City may incur by
reason of any shrinkage or settlement in the excavated area resulting

A. The purpose of this chapter is to establish guidelines for the siting of
wireless telecommunications towers and antennas and ancillary
facilities. The goals of this chapter are to: protect residential areas and
land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas;
encourage the location of towers on municipally owned property where
appropriate or in other nonresidential areas; minimize the total number
of towers throughout the community; strongly encourage the joint use
of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than
construction of additional single-use towers; encourage the use of
existing buildings, telecommunications towers, light or utility poles, or
water towers as opposed to construction of new telecommunications
towers; encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is
minimal; ensure that all telecommunications facilities, including
towers, antennas and ancillary facilities, are located and designed to
minimize the visual impact on the immediate surroundings and
throughout the community by encouraging users of towers and
antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual
impact of the towers and antennas through careful design, siting,
landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques; enhance
the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide
such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently;
consider the public health and safety of telecommunications towers;
and avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures.
B. In furtherance of these purposes, the City of Pleasantville shall give due
consideration to the City's Master Plan, Zoning Map, existing land uses
and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the location
of towers and antennas.

§ 266-2 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 266-4
266:550
A. Principal or accessory use. Telecommunications antennas and towers
may be considered either principal or accessory uses. Notwithstanding
any other land use regulation, a different existing structure on the same
lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot.
If a tower and its appurtenant structures constitute the sole use of the
lot, the tower shall be deemed to be the principal use.
B. Lot size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a
tower or antenna complies with zone regulations, including but not
limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other
such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even
though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within
such lot.
C. State or federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of
the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers
and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the
owners of the towers and antennas governed by this Chapter shall bring
such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards
and regulations within 90 days of the effective date of such standards
and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by
the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring towers and
antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations
shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the
owner's expense.
D. Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of
towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local
building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are
published by the Electronic Industries Association and
Telecommunications Industry Association, as amended from time to
time. If, upon inspection, the City of Pleasantville concludes that a
tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a
danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the
owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower
into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into
compliance within said 30 days shall constitute grounds for the removal
of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense.
E. Not essential services. Telecommunications towers and antennas shall
be regulated and permitted pursuant to this Chapter and shall not be
regulated or permitted as essential services, public utilities, or private
utilities.
F. Collocation required. The City of Pleasantville mandates that carriers
collocate antennas on towers and other structures whenever possible.
See § 266-7 for collocation requirements.
§ 266-4 TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES, § 266-4
266:551
§ 266-5. Use regulations.
G. Conditional use. Telecommunications facilities on public land in the City
of Pleasantville shall be principal uses. Telecommunications facilities on
nonpublic lands in the City of Pleasantville shall be conditional uses in
accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-67.
H. Site plan required. Site plan approval shall be required for all new
telecommunications facilities in the City of Pleasantville, including
modifications to or addition of new telecommunications facilities to
preexisting towers, buildings or other structures. For the purposes of
this Chapter, the City's Zoning Official may approve site plans for
telecommunications facilities on public lands, provided that said
permitted uses conform to the use regulations established in § 266-5,
and site design standards established in § 266-6 herein. All other site
plans for telecommunications facilities must be approved by an
approving body pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.
A. Permitted use. Wireless telecommunications facilities are permitted as
permitted uses on all lands owned by the City of Pleasantville
regardless of zoning district.
B. Conditional use. Wireless telecommunications facilities are permitted
as conditional uses in the Regional Shopping Center (RSC) and
Industrial (IND) Zoning Districts and in the Economic Redevelopment
Area (EDA) Zoning Overlay District.
C. Conditional and permitted use standards. Wireless telecommunications
facilities may be permitted on the above-referenced lands, provided
that:
(1) The minimum lot size on which the telecommunications facility is to
be located is at least 30,000 square feet in area.
(2) Lattice towers and any type of guyed tower are prohibited.
(3) Telecommunications towers shall be limited to monopoles without
guys designed to ultimately accommodate at least three carriers
and shall meet the following height and usage criteria:
(a) For a single carrier, up to 120 feet in height;
(b) For two carriers, up to 140 feet in height; and
(c) For three or more carriers, up to 160 feet feet in height.
D. Factors considered in granting use permits.
(1) In addition to the above standards, the approving board or Zoning
Official, as appropriate, shall consider the following factors in
determining whether to issue a conditional use permit:
§ 266-4 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 266-5
266:552
§ 266-6. Site design standards.
The following site design standards shall apply to wireless
telecommunications facilities:
(a) Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;
(b) Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
(c) Surrounding topography;
(d) Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
(e) Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating
visual obtrusiveness, including stealth designs which are
encouraged;
(f) Availability of suitable existing towers, alternative tower
structures, other structures or alternative technologies not
requiring the use of towers or structures;
(g) Availability of proposed tower to other potential carriers.
(2) This list is considered to be illustrative in nature and may not
include all factors to be considered.
A. New towers.
(1) Telecommunications towers may not be located closer than 300
feet to any residential zone. Antennas located on preexisting
buildings or structures are exempt from this requirement.
(2) Fall zone.
(a) A fall zone shall be established such that the tower is set back
50% of the height of the tower from any adjoining lot line or
nonappurtenant building. This tower setback requirement may
be adjusted higher or lower by the approving board or Zoning
Official, as appropriate, based on the design of the antenna
mount(s) on the top of the tower and the particular geography
of the subject site in relation to the features of the adjoining
lands or rights-of-way consistent with the intent of the
definition of "fall zone" of this Chapter.
(b) The above notwithstanding, in no instance shall a fall zone be
less than 20 feet from the edge of the tower (measured at the
base) to the inside edge of the buffer area required for the site.
(c) The fall zone setback may supercede the zoning district
setback for a site for the tower and exposed ancillary facilities
only. Ancillary facilities enclosed in an ancillary building
pursuant to § 266-6A(5) of this Chapter must satisfy the
§ 266-5 TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES, § 266-6
266:553
minimum zoning district setback requirements for accessory
structures.
(3) Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not
less than eight feet in height. Said towers shall be equipped with
appropriate anti-climbing measures.
(4) Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the
landscaping surrounding towers:
(a) Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screens the view of the tower
compound from property used for residences or planned
residences or any other area frequented by the public. The
standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least 10
feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound. However, at
a minimum, the facility should be shielded from public view by
evergreen trees at least eight feet high (3 1/2 inch caliper) at
planting and planted in staggered double rows 15 feet on
center.
(b) In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be
minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced at the
sole discretion of the approving authority.
(c) Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some
cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural
growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient
buffer.
(5) Ancillary buildings. Any proposed building enclosing related
electronic equipment shall not be more than 10 feet in height nor
more than 200 square feet in area, and only one such building shall
be permitted on the lot for each provider of wireless
telecommunications services located on the site. Such buildings
must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements for
accessory structures.
(6) Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following
requirements:
(a) Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or,
subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a
neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(b) At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related
structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors,
textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend them into
the natural setting and surrounding buildings.
§ 266-6 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 266-6
266:554
(7) Lighting. No lighting is permitted except as follows, which shall be
subject to review and approval by the approving board as part of
the site plan approval process:
(a) The building enclosing electronic equipment may have one
light at the entrance to the building, provided that the light is
attached to the building, is focused downward and is switched
so that the light is turned on only when workers are at the
building; and
(b) No lighting is permitted on a tower except lighting that
specifically is required by the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA), and any such required lighting shall be focused and
shielded to the greatest extent possible so as not to project
towards adjacent and nearby properties.
(8) Signs. No signs are permitted except those required by the Federal
Communications Commission, the Electronic Industries
Association (EIA) and/or the Telecommunication Industry
Association (TIA) or by law, such as warning and equipment
information signs.
B. Antennas mounted on existing structures or roof tops.
(1) Antennas on existing structures. Any antenna which is not attached
to a tower may be attached to any existing business, industrial,
office, utility or institutional structure owned by the City of
Pleasantville or in the zoning districts enumerated in § 266-5B of
this chapter.
(a) Side- and roof-mounted personal wireless service facilities
shall not project more than 10 feet above the height of an
existing building or structure nor project more than 10 feet
above the height limit of the zoning district within which the
facility is located. Personal wireless service facilities may
locate on a building or structure that is legally nonconforming
with respect to height, provided that the facilities do not
project above the existing building or structure height.
(b) The antenna complies with all applicable FCC and FAA
regulations.
(c) The antenna complies with all applicable building codes.
(d) The equipment structure shall not contain more than 200
square feet of gross floor area or be more than 10 feet in
height. In addition, for buildings and structures which are less
than 48 feet in height, the related unmanned equipment
structure shall be located on the ground and shall not be
located on the roof of the structure.
§ 266-6 TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES, § 266-6
266:555
§ 266-7. Collocation.
(e) If the equipment structure is located on the roof of a building,
the area of the equipment structure and other equipment and
structures shall not occupy more than 10% of the roof area.
(f) Equipment storage buildings, structures or cabinets shall
comply with all applicable building codes.
(2) Aesthetics. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a
tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical
equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to or closely
compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to make
the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as
possible.
C. Antennas on existing towers. An antenna may be attached to a
preexisting tower in a nonresidential zone and, to minimize adverse
visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of
towers, collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on existing
towers shall take precedence over the construction of new towers,
provided such collocation is accomplished in a manner consistent with
the following:
(1) A tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the
collocation of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower type
as the existing tower, unless reconstruction as a monopole is
proposed.
(2) An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height, not
to exceed the maximum tower height established by this Chapter.
(3) On-site location. A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the
collocation of an additional antenna may be moved on site,
provided that the new location is within 10 feet of its existing
location and further provided that said new location is no closer to
any property line or nonappurtenant building than the existing
location.
(a) After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation, only one
tower may remain on the site.
A. The City of Pleasantville requires that licensed carriers share personal
wireless service facilities and sites where feasible and appropriate,
thereby reducing the number of personal wireless service facilities that
are stand-alone facilities. All applicants for site plan approval for a
personal wireless service facility shall demonstrate a good faith effort
to collocate with other carriers. Such good faith effort includes:
(1) A survey of all existing structures that may be feasible sites for
collocating personal wireless service facilities;
§ 266-6 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 266-7
266:556
§ 266-8. Location priorities.
Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be located and approved in
accordance with the following prioritized locations:
§ 266-9. Site plan submission requirements.
In addition to the site plan submission requirements contained in the Zoning
and Land Use Code for the City (Chapter 290 of the City Code), the
following information shall be submitted in conjunction with site plan
approvals for all wireless telecommunications facilities:
(2) Notification by certified mail of intent to seek site plan approval to
all the other licensed carriers for commercial mobile radio services
operating in the county;
(3) Sharing information necessary to determine if collocation is
feasible under the design configuration most accommodating to
collocation; and
(4) A copy of a proposed lease or affidavit of compliance with this
section.
B. In the event that collocation is found to be not technically feasible, a
written statement of the reasons for the unfeasibility shall be submitted
to the City. The City may retain a technical expert in the field of RF
engineering to verify if collocation at the site is not feasible or is
feasible given the design configuration most accommodating to
collocation. The cost for such a technical expert will be at the expense
of the applicant. The City may deny approval to an applicant that has
not demonstrated a good faith effort to provide for collocation.
C. If the applicant does intend to collocate or to permit collocation, plans
and elevations, which show the ultimate appearance and operation of
the personal wireless service facility at full build-out, shall be
submitted.
A. The first priority shall be an existing tower or an existing or proposed
water tower or standpipe owned by either a public or private utility
within or near the City of Pleasantville.
B. The second priority shall be new towers on lands owned by the City of
Pleasantville.
C. The third priority shall be an existing building in the Regional Shopping
Center (RSC), Industrial (IND) and Economic Redevelopment Area
(EDA) Zoning Districts.
D. The fourth priority shall be new towers on lands not owned by the City
of Pleasantville located within the Regional Shopping Center (RSC),
Industrial (IND) and Economic Redevelopment Area (EDA) Zoning
Districts.

any proposed location of wireless telecommunications antennas (and
any supporting tower and/or ancillary building enclosing related
electronic equipment) has been planned to result in the fewest number
of towers within the City of Pleasantville at the time full service is
provided by the applicant throughout the municipality, the applicant
shall submit a comprehensive service plan. Said comprehensive service
plan shall indicate how the applicant proposes to provide full service
throughout the municipality and, to the greatest extent possible, said
service plan shall also indicate how the applicant's plan is coordinated
with the needs of all other providers of telecommunications services
within the City. The comprehensive service plan shall indicate the
following:
(1) Whether the applicant's subscribers can receive adequate service
from antennas located outside of the borders of the City of
Pleasantville.
(2) How the proposed location of the antennas relates to the location of
any existing towers within and/or near the City of Pleasantville.
(3) How the proposed location of the antennas relates to the
anticipated need for additional antennas and supporting towers
within and/or near the City of Pleasantville by both the applicant
and by other providers of telecommunications services within the
City.
(4) How the proposed location of the antennas relates to the objective
of collocating the antennas of different service carriers on the same
tower.
(5) How the proposed location of the antennas relates to the overall
objective of providing full telecommunications services within the
City of Pleasantville while, at the same, limiting the number of
towers to the fewest possible.
B. A scaled site plan clearly indicating the location, type and height of the
proposed tower, on-site land uses and zoning, adjacent land uses and
zoning (including when adjacent to other municipalities), and all
properties within the applicable fall zone, adjacent roadways, proposed
means of access, setbacks from property lines, elevation drawings of
the proposed tower and any other structure, topography, parking and
other information deemed by the approving authority to be necessary to
assess compliance with this chapter.
C. Legal description of the entire tract and leased parcel (if applicable).
D. The setback distance between the proposed tower and the nearest
residential unit and residentially zoned properties.
E. The separation distance from other towers and antennas.

owner(s) and their successors in interest.
L. A visual impact study containing, at a minimum, a photographic
simulation showing the appearance of the proposed tower, antennas
and ancillary facilities from at least five points within a three-mile
radius. Such points shall be chosen by the carrier with review and
approval by the approving board or designee to ensure that various
potential views are represented.
M. An analysis of the RFR levels at the facility as a means of assessing
compliance with the FCC RF safety criteria. This analysis shall:
(1) Take into consideration all collocated radio transmitting antennas
and/or nearby antennas that could contribute to RFR levels at the
facility.
(2) Be performed by an RF engineer, health physicist or similar
knowledgeable individual.
(3) Follow current methods recommended by the FCC for performing
such analyses.
A. After the wireless telecommunications facility is operational, the

ARTICLE IV
Administrative Bodies and Related Agencies
§ 300-11. Planning Board established; composition.
A. There is herewith established, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-23, a
Planning Board for the City of Pleasantville. Such Planning Board shall
consist of nine regular members, which shall consist of and be divided
into the following four classes:
(1) Class I: the Mayor of the City of Pleasantville or, in the absence of
the Mayor, a designee who shall be appointed by the Mayor.
(2) Class II: one official of the City of Pleasantville, other than a
member of the City Council, who shall be appointed by the Mayor.
If the City adopts an Environmental Commission, the member of
the Environmental Commission who is also a member of the
Planning Board as required by N.J.S.A. 40:56A-1 shall be deemed to
be the Class II Planning Board member in the event that there be
among the Class IV or alternate members of the Planning Board
both a member of the Zoning Board of Adjustment and a member of
the Board of Education.
(3) Class III: one member of the governing body, who shall be
appointed by the members of the governing body.
(4) Class IV: six other citizens of the City of Pleasantville, who shall be
appointed by the Mayor. Class IV members shall hold no other City
office, position or employment, except that one member may be a
member of the Zoning Board of Adjustment and one may be a
member of the Board of Education. If the City adopts an
Environmental Commission, the member of the Environmental
Commission who is also a member of the Planning Board as
required by N.J.S.A. 40:56A-1 shall be deemed to be the Class II
Planning Board member, unless there be among the Class IV or
alternate members of the Planning Board both a member of the
Zoning Board of Adjustment and a member of the Board Of
Education, in which case the member common to the Planning
Board and Environmental Commission shall be deemed a Class II
member of the Planning Board. For the purpose of this section,
membership on a municipal board or commission whose function is
advisory in nature, and the establishment of which is discretionary
and not required by statute, shall not be considered the holding of
municipal office.
B. Alternate members. There shall be appointed to the Planning Board not
more than two alternate members. Such alternates members shall meet
the qualifications of Class IV members and shall be designated by the
Mayor at time of appointment as "Alternate No. 1" and "Alternate No.
2." Alternate members may participate in all matters but may not vote
except in the absence or disqualification of a regular member of any
§ 300-11 WATER § 300-11
285:753
class. Participation of alternate members shall not be deemed to
increase the size of the Planning Board established by ordinance of
the governing body pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-23. A vote shall not
be delayed in order that a regular member may vote instead of an
alternate member. In the event that a choice must be made as to which
alternate member is to vote, Alternate No. 1 shall vote.
C. Temporary members. If the Planning Board lacks a quorum because any
of its regular or alternate members is prohibited by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-23
or 40:55D-23.1 from acting on a matter due to the member's personal
or financial interests therein, regular members of the Zoning Board of
Adjustment shall be called upon to serve, for that matter only, as
temporary members of the Planning Board in order of seniority of
continuous service to the Zoning Board of Adjustment until there are in
attendance the minimum number of Planning Board members
necessary to constitute a quorum to act upon the matter without any
personal or financial interest therein, whether direct or indirect. If a
choice has to be made between regular members of equal seniority, the
Chair of the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall make the choice.

forth below shall be, at the time of appointment and throughout their
term as a member of the Planning Board, residents of the City of

terms of the alternate members shall be such that the term of not
more than one alternate member shall expire in any one year;

alternate members first appointed exceed two years. A vacancy
occurring otherwise than by expiration of a term shall be filled by
the Mayor for the unexpired term only.

Board shall be permitted to act on any matter in which such member

a particular matter by reason of such conflict of interest, such member
shall not continue to sit with the Board on the hearing of such matter,
nor shall such member participate in any discussions or proceedings
related thereto. Nothing herein shall deny a Board member who has

personal or financial interests therein, Class IV members of the
Planning Board shall be called upon to serve, for that matter only, as
temporary members of the Zoning Board in order of seniority of
continuous service to the Planning Board until there are in attendance
the minimum number of Zoning Board members necessary to constitute
a quorum to act upon the matter without any personal or financial
interest therein, whether direct or indirect. If a choice has to be made
between Class IV members of equal seniority, the Chair of the Planning
Board shall make the choice.

and throughout their term as a member of the Zoning Board, residents
of the City of Pleasantville. No member of the Zoning Board may hold

§ 300-19 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-19
285:800

(4) Bulk regulations. Except as expressly provided otherwise in
Subsection Q(3), every temporary use shall comply with the bulk
regulations applicable in the zoning district in which such
temporary use is located.
(5) Parking and loading. Before approving any temporary use, the
Zoning Officer shall make an assessment of the total number of offstreet
parking and loading spaces which will be reasonably
required for such use, on the basis of the particular use, its
intensity and the availability of other parking and loading facilities
in the area, and shall approve such temporary use only if such offstreet
parking and loading is provided.
A. Except as provided in § 300-20A(5), following the effective date of this
chapter, any use, building or structure lawfully existing at the time of
enactment of this chapter, but not in conformity with the provisions of
§ 300-19 WATER § 300-20
285:801
this chapter for the zoning district in which such use, building or
structure is located, may be continued indefinitely, subject to the
following limitations:
(1) Expansion or alteration. No nonconforming use, building or
structure shall be enlarged, extended, increased, altered or
relocated to a different portion of the lot or parcel of land occupied
by such use, building or structure on the effective date of this
chapter, or of any applicable amendment thereto, nor shall any
external evidence of such nonconforming use, building or structure
be increased by any means whatsoever, except whereby through
such action the use, building or structure is made conforming.
(2) Change from nonconforming to nonconforming. No nonconforming
use, building or structure shall be changed to another
nonconforming use, building or structure without appropriate
variance relief from the Board of Adjustment.
(3) Restoration of nonconforming buildings.
(a) Any nonconforming building or structure which shall be
damaged by reason of event of windstorm, flood, fire, explosion
or other natural or man-made disaster, of any kind, may be
restored to its pre-event condition within 12 months of such
damage. No action resulting in an increase in any structural
nonconformity shall be made without approval of the Planning
Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be.
(b) If the restoration of such building is not completed within said
twelve-month period, such building shall be deemed to have
been abandoned, unless a use shall have been carried on
without interruption in an undamaged portion of such building.
In case of such abandonment, such building or structure may
not be rebuilt, restored or repaired except in conformity with
this chapter.
(c) In the event that such damage to the nonconforming building
or structure exceeds 50% of its replacement value as
calculated by the City's Construction Code Official as of the
date of the damage, such building or structure shall be deemed
to be completely destroyed, and such building or structure may
not be rebuilt, restored or repaired except in conformity with
this chapter.
(4) Restoration of conforming building with nonconforming use.
(a) An otherwise conforming building or structure hosting a
nonconforming use wherein such building or structure shall be
damaged by reason of event of windstorm, flood, fire, explosion
or other natural or man-made disaster, of any kind, may be
restored to its pre-event condition and the nonconforming use
reinstated within 12 months of such damage. No action
§ 300-20 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-20
285:802
resulting in an increase in any nonconformity shall be made
without approval of the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be.
(b) If the restoration of such building or structure is not completed
such that the nonconforming use is resumed within said
twelve-month period, the physical operation of the
nonconforming use shall be deemed to have ceased, unless
such nonconforming use shall have been carried on without
interruption in an undamaged portion of such building.
(5) Continuation of use upon destruction of structure. Where a
nonconforming use is undertaken in a nonconforming structure,
the destruction of the nonconforming structure shall serve to
eliminate the lawful preexistence of the nonconforming use. For the
purpose of this subsection, "destruction" is defined in accordance
with Subsection A(3)(c) hereinabove.
(6) Reestablishment. No nonconforming use shall be reestablished
after the physical operation thereof has ceased and discontinued,
for any reason, for a period of not less than 12 months, and upon a
finding of intentional abandonment by the Zoning Officer. Intent to
resume active operation of a nonconforming use after cessation
thereof, without actual physical resumption of activities, shall not
confer the right to do so.
(7) Reversion prohibited. No nonconforming use, building or structure
which has been changed into a conforming use, building or
structure may be returned to the prior nonconforming use, building
or structure or converted to another nonconforming use, building
or structure.
(8) Safety. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent normal
maintenance and repair of any building, or the carrying out, upon
issuance of a building permit, of major structural alterations or
demolitions necessary in the interest of public safety. In granting
such a permit, the Construction Code Official shall state the precise
reason(s) to the Board of Adjustment why such alterations were
deemed necessary.
(9) Approved construction. Nothing in this section shall require any
change in plans, construction or designated use of a building or
structure for which a building permit has been issued prior to the
effective date of this chapter.
B. Nonconforming lots of record.
(1) In any zoning district where single-family detached dwellings are
permitted, a single-family detached dwelling, along with such
accessory buildings or structures which may be normal and
customary thereto, may be erected on any single lot which was of
record at the effective date of this chapter, notwithstanding
§ 300-20 WATER § 300-20
285:803
§ 300-21. Deconversion of illegal nonconforming residential uses,
buildings or structures.
limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter. Such a
nonconforming lot of record must be in separate ownership and
not of contiguous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.
Such provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the
requirements for lot size or lot width, or both, applicable in the
zoning district in which such lot is located; provided, however,
that such nonconforming lot of record shall conform with all other
district requirements, and further provided that any
nonconforming lot of record sold after the effective date of this
chapter shall be subject to all zoning district regulations applicable
as provided in this chapter.
(2) Where two or more individual lots, combinations of lots, or portions
of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record
at the effective date of this chapter, and where all of the individual
lots, combinations of lots, or portions of lots do not meet the
requirements established for lot size and lot width for the zoning
district in which such lots, combination of lots or portions of lots
are located, the lands involved shall be considered to be a single,
undivided parcel for purposes of this chapter, and no portion of
such parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes
compliance with the lot size and lot width requirements of the
zoning district in which such parcel is located; nor shall any
division of any parcel be made which creates a lot whose lot size or
lot width does not conform to the requirements of the zoning
district in which such lot or parcel is located.
A. Purpose.
(1) Conversion of existing buildings to increase the number of dwelling
units contained in them presents problems not encountered when
new buildings are designed and constructed for the same number
of units. Such conversions can adversely affect a neighborhood
originally designed for low-density development through
overcrowding and its concomitant problems of inadequate
recreational space, inadequate parking and overtaxed municipal
services. These, in turn, may contribute to the physical decline and
deterioration of the area.
(2) The intent of this section is to establish standards to prevent the
overcrowding of dwelling units and overly dense development of
neighborhoods and to ensure satisfactory amenities in
neighborhoods as conversions take place.
B. The following provisions identify the practices and procedures for the
identification and deconversion of illegal nonconforming residential
uses, buildings and structures.
§ 300-20 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-21
285:804
(1) No residential building shall be sold, transferred, altered,
renovated or reconstructed, and no dwelling unit conversion shall
be undertaken, without the part responsible therefor first obtaining
a zoning permit certifying that such residential building is in
compliance with the requirements of this chapter as relates to the
zoning district in which such building is located.
(2) Any City employee vested with the responsibility of making
inspections, whether they be building inspections, construction
inspections, mercantile inspections, land use inspections or any
other type of inspection, is required to report, in writing, any
activity or situation which in his/her judgment may be in violation
of this section. The Zoning Officer shall notify all employees subject
to this section.
(3) Any designated representative of the City who makes an inspection
in order to issue any certificate, license or permit shall determine
the appropriate zoning district in which the subject property is
located, and shall refuse to issue, or cause to be issued, any such
certificate, license or permit if the property, structure or use(s)
thereon do(es) not conform with the requirements of the zoning
district in which such property is located. Any such nonconformity
shall be referred to the Zoning Officer or his/her designee,
whereupon one of the following determinations shall be made:
(a) Where City records support lawful preexistence of the
nonconformity, the Zoning Officer shall issue a letter to the
property owner, via certified mail, advising him/her of the
nonconforming condition of the property and the necessity of
obtaining a certificate of nonconformity from the Zoning
Officer, if such nonconformity was discovered within one year
of any change in this chapter resulting in such nonconformity,
or from the Zoning Board of Adjustment in all other cases.
(b) Where City records do not support the lawful preexistence of
the nonconformity, the Zoning Officer shall issue a letter to the
property owner, via certified mail, advising him/her of the
nonconforming condition of the property and that one of the
following steps are necessary:
[1] The property owner is required to file for a certificate of
nonconformity with the Zoning Board of Adjustment;
[2] The property owner is required to file for a zoning variance
with the Zoning Board of Adjustment; or
[3] The property owner is required to deconvert the
nonconforming dwelling unit(s).
(c) Any individual and/or entity who receives written notice from
the Zoning Officer in accordance with this subsection and does
not file an appropriate application with the Zoning Officer or
§ 300-21 WATER § 300-21
285:805
§ 300-22. Residential zoning districts.
Zoning Board of Adjustment pursuant to such subsection
within 30 days of receipt of such letter must commence the
deconversion of the nonconforming dwelling unit(s) as follows
[and the letter issued by the Zoning Officer under Subsection
B(3)(b) advising the property owner of the nonconforming
property, structure or use(s) shall specifically state]:
[1] The kitchen (sink, cooking appliances, dishwasher and
cabinets) in any illegal dwelling unit shall be completely
removed and the unit returned to its original room
configuration, all dead bolts on all interior entry doors
must be removed, holes repaired and doors painted or
finished. All separate doorbells, mailboxes, doorknockers
and separate utility meters must be removed;
[2] The deconversion shall be completed within 90 days of the
date of such letter. In the event that more than three units
are to be deconverted, the Zoning Officer may, at his/her
discretion, extend the time period for deconversion for an
additional 60 days; and
[3] At the termination of such ninety-day period, the Zoning
Officer or designee shall inspect the property.
[4] If more than three units are to be deconverted, the Zoning
Officer may extend the period of time to complete such
deconversion for a period not to exceed an additional 60
days.
(d) If the steps of deconversion are not followed precisely, then a
summons shall be issued along with a certified letter advising
the property owner that a penalty of $2,000 per violation will
be sought by the City in Municipal Court in the event that the
owner is found guilty.
(e) Upon successful completion of the deconversion, the Zoning
Officer shall note that fact in a ledger to be maintained by his/
her office and shall schedule a follow-up inspection one year
from the date that the conversion was completed. The Zoning
Officer shall also issue a letter to all utilities advising said
utilities of the legal use of the building; the actions taken by
the City to deconvert the building to its proper use; and the
requirement that any action to return the building to an illegal
use be reported to the Zoning Officer.
A. Purpose. The purpose and intent of the City's residential zoning
districts is to permit residential development of varied sizes and
densities within the City of Pleasantville in order to provide for a range
of housing types throughout the community, thereby providing a
§ 300-21 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-22

stimulate meaningful and valuable development as a
replacement to the patchwork of underutilized and
underproductive uses existing in this section of the City.

on its northeast and southeast edges, are extremely
environmentally sensitive, the Conservation Zoning District was

locations in specific sections of the City for a variety of specialized land
uses which may be appropriate for and benefit from being sited in such
locations but which do not necessitate the removal or displacement of
the existing land uses in such locations, and therefore do not require
change in the base (i.e., underlying) zoning of such locations. The
benefit of such overlay zoning is to permit certain land uses in an area
without rendering the existing land uses nonconforming.

Land Use Approvals
§ 300-26. Application submission process.
A. Purpose.
(1) The purpose of this section is to establish a unified set of
procedures and standards governing applications for land use
review and approval.
(2) Consistent with the structure of the New Jersey Municipal Land
Use Law, this section makes no distinction between site plan and
subdivision approvals, but does distinguish between major site
plans and subdivisions and minor site plans and subdivisions, as
same are defined in this chapter.
(3) The regulations established herein are designed to insure that
development in the City of Pleasantville is consistent with the
Pleasantville Master Plan, and Capital Improvement Program,
Official Map and this chapter, and that adequate consideration will
be given to critical on-tract and off-tract engineering, planning and
design elements in order to insure the least possible adverse effect
upon, and the greatest possible benefit to, the public health, safety
and welfare as a result of public and private development. Toward
such end, it is the purpose of this section to assure that all
development requiring land use approval is located, planned,
designed, constructed and serviced to:
(a) Provide for adequate light, air and privacy;
(b) Secure safety from fire, flood and other danger;
(c) Be served by or provide adequate public improvements, public
sites and rights-of-way and essential public and quasi-public
services and facilities;
(d) Provide the most beneficial relationship between land use,
structural form and traffic circulation, having particular regard
to the avoidance of congestion in the streets and highways and
the adequate provision for pedestrian and vehicular movement
and adequacy of parking and loading;
(e) Prevent the pollution of air, water and land;
(f) Assure the adequacy of drainage facilities;
(g) Safeguard the water table;
(h) Provide for open space through the most efficient design and
layout of the land;
§ 300-26 WATER § 300-26
285:863
(i) Insure the proper use and management of the natural
resources in the City in order to preserve the integrity and
stability of such features and to ensure appropriate
development while minimizing negative impacts to such
features;
(j) Provide for the orderly layout and design of new subdivisions
and resubdivisions; and
(k) In the case of subdivisions, provide for the proper conveyance
of land by insuring accurate legal descriptions and the proper
placement of survey monumentation.
B. Procedures.
(1) All applications for land use approval, including pre-application
conferences and applications for site plan approval, subdivision
approval and variance relief, shall be submitted to the Zoning
Officer, who shall review the application against the appropriate
City checklist (§ 300-77) for the purpose of determining if such
application is complete or incomplete as required under N.J.S.A.
40:55D-10.3.
(2) Site plans which include design of drainage, pavement, curbing,
walkways, embankments, horizontal and vertical geometrics,

subdivisions, shall be provided by or attributed to a New Jersey
licensed professional land surveyor.

number. Once an application has been assigned a number, such
number shall appear on all papers, maps, plats or plans and other
documents submitted for processing in conjunction with the
application.
(4) No application will be processed which does not include the
appropriate application fees and escrow deposits.
(a) It shall be the applicant's responsibility to insure that
application fees and escrow deposits are sufficient to address
all approvals required, consistent with the fee schedule found

285:865

and thorough review of the subject application.
(2) Accordingly, applicants are advised when requesting waivers that
such Board requirement may result in a delay in the hearing

found to contain all of the information required by the appropriate
checklist(s):

application has been deemed complete and that the applicant is

Board Secretary shall schedule the application at a regularly
scheduled Board meeting under the time frames established by the
Municipal Land Use Law. (Note: Including, but not limited to,
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-46, 40:55D-47, 40:55D-48 and 40:55D-50.)

by the application forms and/or the appropriate checklist(s), the
Zoning Officer shall either:
(a) Cause the applicant to be notified, in writing, that said
application is incomplete, specifying the deficiencies in the
application; or
(b) If the Zoning Officer reasonably concludes that the missing
items of information are not necessary for the Board to make
an informed decision on the application, the Zoning Officer
may waive the requirement that said items be supplied as a
prerequisite for completeness, and certify that the application
is complete, notwithstanding the missing items. Such
certification shall be for completeness only, and does not limit
the Board's right to demand such information if it, in its
discretion, determines that such information is required to
make an informed decision on the matter.
(2) An applicant who has been notified that the application is
incomplete may request that one or more checklist requirements
be waived, in which event the Zoning Officer shall grant or deny the
request within 45 days.

40:55D-72, 40:55D-73 and 40:55D-74.) within 20 days of the action

(3) Copies of every development regulation and any revision or
amendment thereto shall be filed in the office of the Pleasantville
City Clerk and in the office of the Board Secretary. Such copies
shall be maintained in each such office and shall be available to any
interested party upon reasonable request and a payment of a fee in
accordance with § 300-9.
(4) No development regulation required to be filed with the County
Planning Board and no Official Map required to be filed with the
County Recording Officer pursuant to Subsection J(1) and J(2) shall
take effect until so filed.
A. Whenever an application for development has been granted pursuant to
this chapter and the developer is willing and able to proceed with the
development but is barred from proceeding by a legal action instituted
by any state agency, political subdivision or other party to protect the
public health and welfare, or by a directive or order issued by any state
agency, political subdivision or court of competent jurisdiction to
protect the public health or welfare, the running of the period of
approval under this chapter shall be suspended for the period of time
said legal action is pending or such directive or order is in effect.
B. A developer may submit a development application pursuant to this
chapter which is directly or indirectly barred by a legal action instituted
by a state agency, political subdivision or other party to protect the
public health and welfare, or by a directive or order issued by any state
agency, political subdivision or court of competent jurisdiction to
§ 300-30 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-31
285:874
§ 300-32. Development dependent on other agency approval.
Whenever a developer submits an application for development pursuant to
this chapter which requires the approval of an agency outside the provisions
of this chapter, the responsible board shall process the application as
if no further approval was required, and any approval granted shall be
conditioned upon the approval of such outside agency.
§ 300-33. Successive applications.
§ 300-34. Applications for zoning permits.
protect the public health and welfare. The Board to which the
application is submitted shall process the application as if no such
bar existed, and any approval granted shall be conditioned upon the
removal of such legal barrier to development.
A. Whenever any application, appeal or other request filed pursuant to this
chapter has been finally denied on its merits, a second application,
appeal or other request seeking essentially the same relief, whether or
not in the same form or on the same theory, shall not be brought unless,
in the opinion of the Board before which it is brought, substantial new
evidence is available or a mistake of law or fact significantly affected
the prior denial.
B. Any such second application shall include a detailed statement of
grounds justifying consideration of such application.
C. Such application may be denied summarily and without hearing upon a
finding that no grounds appear which warrant a new hearing. In any
case where such application is set for hearing, the applicant shall be
required to establish grounds warranting reconsideration of the merits
of the application prior to being allowed to offer any evidence on the
merits. Unless such grounds are established, the application may be
summarily dismissed for such failure.
A. Authority.
(1) The Zoning Officer or his duly authorized delegate shall have
authority to issue zoning permits in accordance with the provisions
of this section.
(2) Any zoning permit issued in conflict with the provisions of this
chapter shall be considered void ab initio (i.e., from the beginning).
B. Purpose. A zoning permit is intended to serve the following general
purposes:

chapter.
(2) As a means for evidencing such compliance.
§ 300-31 WATER § 300-34
285:875
(3) As an adjunct to, and thus must be filed prior to or with, all other
applications filed pursuant to this chapter with respect to a specific
use or development proposal. When so filed, a zoning permit serves
as a vehicle for routine plan review by the Zoning Officer prior to
consideration of special requests by other officers, boards and
commissions, thus avoiding needless special reviews of defective
plans.
C. Submission and processing of applications.
(1) Unless a zoning permit shall have first been obtained from the
Zoning Officer:
(a) The construction, reconstruction, remodeling, alteration or
moving of any structure shall not begin.

used or occupied for any purpose.
(c) The improvement of land preliminary to any use of such land
shall not begin.

(e) No use or occupancy of any land or structure shall be changed
to any other use or occupancy, whether or not construction,
reconstruction, remodeling, alteration or moving is involved.
(f) No home occupation shall be established.

(2) In any case where a zoning permit is not required under this
chapter, the Zoning Officer shall, on written request, issue a
binding certification of such fact.
(3) An application for a zoning permit shall be made, in writing, to the
Zoning Officer, shall be in such form and contain such information
and documentation as is required by Checklist A and Checklist B,
included in § 300-77, and shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable
application fee and escrow deposit in accordance with § 300-9.
(4) The Zoning Officer shall act on an application for a zoning permit
within 10 days following determination of a completed application
therefor, and shall promptly inform the applicant whether the
application has been granted, denied, or will require review and
approval beyond the jurisdiction of the Zoning Officer pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter.
§ 300-34 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-34
285:876
(5) In any case where an application is granted, the Zoning Officer
shall issue a zoning permit, which shall, either directly or by
incorporation of explicitly identified plans and documents, describe
the proposed construction, reconstruction, remodeling, alteration,
moving or subdivision to which the permit applies, and shall certify
the compliance of such construction, reconstruction, remodeling,
alteration, moving or subdivision with all or stated provisions of
this chapter.
(6) Every zoning permit issued shall state on its face, in bold, capital
letters:
THIS ZONING PERMIT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN THE
PLEASANTVILLE LAND MANAGEMENT CODE WHICH MAY
OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME.
THIS ZONING PERMIT DOES NOT SIGNIFY
CONSTRUCTION CODE REVIEW OR APPROVAL.
APPLICATION IS NOT AUTHORIZATION TO UNDERTAKE
ANY WORK WITHOUT SUCH REVIEW AND APPROVAL
(WHERE EITHER IS REQUIRED).
BEFORE ANY STRUCTURE TO WHICH THIS ZONING
PERMIT IS APPLICABLE MAY BE OCCUPIED OR USED FOR
ANY PURPOSE, A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY OR
OCCUPANCY PERMIT MUST BE OBTAINED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH § 300-43 AND CHAPTER 119
(CONSTRUCTION CODES, UNIFORM) OF THE
PLEASANTVILLE CITY CODE.
(7) In any case where an application is denied, the Zoning Officer shall
state the specific reasons therefor, shall cite the specific provisions
of this chapter upon which such denial is based and shall state any
special approval procedure for relief of such denial available under
this chapter but beyond the jurisdiction of the Zoning Officer.
(8) A duplicate copy of every zoning permit issued or denied pursuant
to this section, numbered consecutively and showing the fee
charged therefor, together with such portions of the application as
the Zoning Officer may consider necessary for the proper
administration of this chapter, shall be kept on file by the Zoning
Officer as a public record, open to inspection by interested parties
at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice.
(9) Effect of approval.
(a) The issuance of a zoning permit shall not authorize the
establishment or extension of any use nor the development,
construction, relocation, alteration or moving of any building
or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing
and processing of applications for any additional permits and
approvals which may be required by the codes and ordinances
§ 300-34 WATER § 300-34
285:877
§ 300-35. Preapplication conference.
of the City or other governmental agency, including but not
limited to a building permit, a certificate of occupancy and
any special permits or approvals required pursuant to the

certification of compliance with specified provisions of this
chapter, such permit shall not be construed to certify
compliance as to any matter not shown on such plans or to any
provision other than those specified.
(10) Limitations on approval. Except to the extent that, under this
chapter, site plan and/or subdivision plat approvals confer specified
rights on the applicant which are irrevocable for specified periods
of time, the issuance of a zoning permit pursuant to this section
shall not limit the right of the City to change the provisions of this
chapter in a manner considered appropriate by it, and upon the
effective date of any such change, inconsistent with any
certification contained in any such permit, such permit shall, to the
extent of such inconsistency, be null, void and of no effect.
A. Purpose.
(1) Prior to filing any application for site plan or subdivision approval,
the prospective applicant may request a preapplication conference
with the Planning Board or Planning and Redevelopment Advisory
Committee. Included in such preapplication conference shall be
relevant City/Board staff and consultants.
(2) The preapplication conference shall be an informal, nonbinding
review of the proposed project designed to broadly acquaint all
parties with the project proposal, air views and concerns of all
parties and provide the applicant with guidance and direction as to
possible solutions to problematic project elements.
B. Submission and processing of applications.
(1) A request for a preapplication conference shall be made, in writing,
to the Planning Board Secretary. Requests shall be in such form as
is required by Checklist A and Checklist C, included in § 300-77,

A and Checklist C as are known at the time, but in any case shall
include the information necessary to provide the Board with a

A. Authority.
(1) The City of Pleasantville hereby requires site plan review and

exterior alteration of any building to be constructed,
§ 300-35 WATER § 300-36
285:879
altered, owned, leased or operated by any such
governmental agency, or the use or development of any
land to be owned, leased or operated by any such

(2) The City of Pleasantville hereby requires subdivision review and
approval for all subdivisions and resubdivisions of land.
(3) The Planning Board shall, subject to the procedures, standards and
limitations hereinafter set forth, have authority to review and
approve or disapprove site plans and subdivision plats as detailed
in § 300-36D, E, F and G.
(4) Such review and approval is required prior to any clearing or
excavation of or removal of soil from a site, prior to any affirmative
construction on a site, prior to the issuance of any building permit
or certificate of occupancy and prior to the recording of any plat or
plan.
(5) Such review and approval shall be subject to the procedures,
standards and limitations hereinafter set forth herein.
(6) Approval by the Zoning Board of Adjustment may substitute for the
approval of the Planning Board whenever the Board of Adjustment
has jurisdiction over a site plan or subdivision pursuant to this
chapter.
B. Exempt development as defined in § 300-10 shall be exempt from the
requirements of this section.
C. Purpose.
(1) The purpose of this section is to establish a unified set of
procedures and standards governing site plan and subdivision
review and approval.
(2) It is the purpose of the provisions of this section to assure that
development will occur only as consistent with the Master Plan,
any capital improvement program, the Official Map and this
chapter, and that adequate consideration will be given to critical
on-tract and off-tract engineering, planning and design elements so
as to assure the least possible adverse effect upon and the greatest
possible benefit to the public health, safety and welfare as a result
§ 300-36 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-36
285:880
of public and private development. In particular, it is the purpose
of this section to insure that all development subject to these
provisions are located, planned, designed, laid out, constructed and
serviced to:
(a) Provide for adequate light, air and privacy;
(b) Secure safety from fire, flood and other danger;
(c) Be served by or provide adequate public improvements, public
sites and rights-of-way and essential public and quasi-public
services and facilities;

to the avoidance of congestion in the streets and highways and
the adequate provision for pedestrian and vehicular movement
of traffic and the adequacy of parking and loading;
(e) Prevent the pollution of air, water and land;
(f) Assure the adequacy of drainage facilities;

(h) Insure the proper use and management of natural resources in
order to preserve their integrity and stability and to ensure
appropriate development while minimizing negative impacts to
such features;
(i) Provide for open spaces through the most efficient design and
layout of the land;
(j) Provide an orderly layout and design of new subdivisions and
resubdivisions; and
(k) In the case of subdivisions, provide for the proper conveyance
of land by ensuring accurate legal descriptions and the proper
placement of monumentation.
(3) Consistent with the structure of the New Jersey Municipal Land
Use Law, this section makes no distinction between cases where
site plan approval is required and those where subdivision approval
is required, but does distinguish between major site plans and
subdivisions and minor site plans and subdivisions, as same are
defined in this chapter.
D. Procedures, general.
(1) The procedures established by this section are intended to serve as
the principal development review mechanism for all significant
development in the City, whether such development is permitted
by-right or requires discretionary (i.e., variance) approval.
§ 300-36 WATER § 300-36
285:881
(2) Requirements for by-right applications. The standards of this
section are intended as minimum standards to be met by all
developments subject to site plan and subdivision review and are
designed to insure that development permitted by-right in the
various zoning districts will be adequately planned, designed and
serviced to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
(3) Requirements for discretionary approvals, combined.
(a) In cases where discretionary approval, as defined in § 300-10,
is required, the procedures for site plan and/or subdivision
approval established herein are designed to be concurrent with
such discretionary approvals so that the applications for such
approvals may be processed without the need for separate
hearings and hearing notices.
(b) Where a development requires site plan and/or subdivision
approval in connection with another discretionary approval
pursuant to other sections of this chapter, additional standards
applicable to such discretionary approvals must be met, such
standards being generally more demanding than the minimum
standards established by this section, it being recognized that
developments subject to such discretionary approvals are
generally those which are expected to have unusual impacts
either on their immediate neighborhood or on the City in
general.
(4) Initiation. An application for site plan or subdivision approval may
be filed by the owner of or other person having a contractual
interest in the subject property.
E. Minor site plans and minor subdivisions.
(1) Purpose. The provisions of this section shall apply only upon a
finding by the Zoning Officer that the proposed development
qualifies as a minor site plan and/or minor subdivision, as defined
in § 300-10, and that no useful purpose would be served by the
bifurcation of the application into preliminary and final phases and
holding separate public hearings on each matter.
(2) Submission and processing of applications.
(a) Applications for minor site plan and/or minor subdivision
approval shall be in such form and shall contain such
information and documentation as is required by Checklist A
and Checklist D, included in § 300-77, and shall be
accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee and escrow
deposit, pursuant to § 300-9.
(b) Upon determination that an applicant has been deemed
complete in accordance with § 300-27, the Planning Board or
§ 300-36 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-36
285:882
Zoning Board Secretary, as the case may be, shall notify the
applicant of the time and place of the hearing on such matter.
(c) The Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case
may be, shall act on an application for minor site plan and/or
minor subdivision approval within 45 days from the time the
application has been determined to be complete, or within
such other time as may be consented to by the applicant.
(d) Effect of approval. Approval of a minor subdivision plat shall be
deemed to be final approval of the subdivision, subject to any
condition imposed.
(e) Limitations on approval/expiration.
[1] Approval of a minor subdivision shall expire 190 days from
the date of memorialization of the Board resolution
approving the application, unless within such period a plat
in conformity with such approval and the provisions of the
Map Filing Law (N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.) is filed by the
applicant with the Atlantic County Recording Officer, the
City Engineer and the Municipal Tax Assessor. Any such
plat accepted for filing shall have been signed by the Chair
and Secretary of the Planning Board, or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be, and referred to the
Atlantic County Planning Board pursuant to this chapter.
[2] Alternatively, the filing and recording of minor
subdivisions may be accomplished by deed, provided that
such deed clearly describes the approved minor
subdivision.
[3] Approval of a minor site plan or subdivision by the
Pleasantville Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case maybe, shall not substitute for or
limit the power of the Atlantic County Planning Board to
review and approve a minor site plan or subdivision under
its jurisdiction.
F. Preliminary major site plans and preliminary major subdivisions.
(1) Purpose.
(a) A preliminary major site plan or preliminary major subdivision
plat is intended to serve as a working document in the
development of a final major site plan or final major subdivision
plat and to provide sufficiently detailed information to allow an
informed decision concerning the overall acceptability of a
proposed development.
§ 300-36 WATER § 300-36
285:883
(b) The preliminary major site plan or preliminary major
subdivision plat is the basis on which the required public
hearing is held.
(c) Approval of the preliminary major site plan or preliminary
major subdivision plat binds the applicant and the City with
respect to the following basic elements of the development (to
the extent applicable):
[1] Consistency of the layout or arrangement of the
subdivision or land development with the requirements of
this chapter.

utilization of lands and buildings to maximize solar
gain, provided that no street of a width greater than
50 feet within the right-of-way lines shall be required
unless said street constitutes an extension of an
existing street of the greater width or already has
been shown at the greater width on the Official Map or
in the Master Plan.
[3] Adequate water supply, drainage, sewerage facilities and
other utilities necessary for essential services to residents

285:884
et seq.) for any airport hazard areas delineated
thereunder.
[8] Provisions governing the standards for grading,
improvement and construction of streets or drives and for
any required walkways, curbs, gutters, streetlights,
landscaping, fire hydrants and water and drainage and
sewerage facilities and other improvements as shall be
found necessary and provisions ensuring that such
facilities shall be completed either prior to or subsequent
to final approval of the subdivision or site plan by allowing
the posting of performance bonds by the developer.

improvements which are necessitated by a subdivision or
land development, subject to the provisions of N.J.S.A.

proposes construction over a period of years, the
protection of the interests of the public and of the
residents, occupants and owners of the proposed
development in the total completion of the development.

approval, the submission of proof that no taxes or
assessments for local improvements are due or delinquent
on the property for which any subdivision or site plan
application is made
[12] Preservation of existing natural resources
[13] Adequate screening, landscaping and location of

Checklist A and Checklist E, included in § 300-77, and shall be
accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee and escrow
deposit, pursuant to § 300-9.
§ 300-36 WATER § 300-36
285:885
(b) Upon determination that an application has been deemed

Zoning Board Secretary, as the case may be, shall notify the
applicant of the time and place of the hearing on such matter.
(c) The Planning Board shall act on an application for preliminary
major site plan and/or preliminary major subdivision approval
within the following time periods, or within such other time as
may be consented to by the applicant:

fewer lots: within 45 days following determination of a
complete application or within such other time as may be

of a complete application or within such other time as may be
consented to by the applicant.
(e) Failure of either board to act within the foregoing time frames
shall constitute approval of the application.
(f) Standard for approval. No application for Preliminary major
site plan and/or preliminary major subdivision approval shall
be granted unless the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be, shall find that, based on the
information presented to it, it is probable that the proposed
development will, upon presentation of an application for final
major site plan and/or final major subdivision pursuant to
§ 300-36G, merit approval on the basis of its compliance with
each of the standards established for site plan and/or
subdivision plat approval pursuant to this chapter.
(g) Conditions for approval.
[1] In granting preliminary major site plan and/or preliminary
major subdivision approval, the Planning Board or Zoning
Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, may impose such
restrictions and conditions upon the approval, the
proposed development or the subject property as may be
necessary, in its opinion, to achieve the purposes of this
chapter and the site plan/subdivision approval process, to
ensure the compliance of the proposed development with
the standards established by this chapter and to prevent or
§ 300-36 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-36
285:886
minimize any adverse effects of the proposed development
upon any portion of the subject property, properties in
the neighborhood of the subject property and/or upon the
general health, safety and welfare of the entire community.
Where any remaining portion of the subject property is
sufficient to be subdivided and/or further developed, the
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case
may be, may require the applicant to submit a conceptual
feasibility plan as to how such land could be subdivided
and/or further developed in order for the Board to
determine the extent that such development might create
or exacerbate any such adverse effects.
[2] Every preliminary site plan or preliminary subdivision
approval shall be conditioned upon the timely submission
of a final site plan or final subdivision in compliance with
the provisions of § 300-36G and upon the applicant's
continuing compliance with applicable laws, ordinances
and regulations and all conditions imposed pursuant to
such approval.
[3] All conditions imposed upon any preliminary site plan or
preliminary subdivision approval, except to the extent
made applicable to all such approvals by this chapter, shall
be expressly set forth in the decision and resolution
granting such approval. The violation of any condition
upon any such approval shall be a violation of this chapter
and shall be sufficient basis for revoking such approval
and for denying any further approval required pursuant to
this chapter or any other ordinance of the City of
Pleasantville.
[4] Upon approval of an application for preliminary major site
plan and/or preliminary major subdivision approval, the
applicant shall furnish 10 copies of such approved plan/
plat to the Secretary of the Planning Board or Zoning
Board of Adjustment, as the case may be. Such approved
plan/plat shall include a notation that the plan/plat has
been approved as well as signature lines for the City
Engineer and the Board Chair and Board Secretary, who
by affixing their signatures to each copy, shall signify such
approval.

preliminary major subdivisions.
[a] The Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as
the case may be, may condition its preliminary major
site plan and/or preliminary major subdivision
approval on such minor revisions or additions as may
be deemed necessary. All such modifications shall be
§ 300-36 WATER § 300-36
285:887
completed and submitted to the Board within 30 days
of such approval.
[b] Withdrawal and resubmission of the application shall
be required in any case where the Planning Board or
Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be,
determines, in its sole discretion, that the necessary
revisions or additions are so substantial in nature,
scope or extent to warrant such resubmission.
(h) Effect of approval. Unless the applicant shall fail to file the final
major site plan and/or preliminary major subdivision plat with
the appropriate County Recording Officer within 95 days of
signature by the Secretary and Chair of the Planning Board or
Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, or shall fail to
proceed with development in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter and the preliminary major site plan and/or
preliminary major subdivision application as approved, or shall
in any other manner fail to comply with any provision of this
chapter or any condition of any approval granted pursuant to
it, a preliminary major site plan or preliminary major
subdivision which has been approved or approved subject to
conditions which have been accepted by the applicant shall not
be modified, revoked or otherwise impaired, pending the
application for approval of a final major site plan and/or final
major subdivision, by any action of the City without the consent
of the applicant.
(i) Limitations on approval/expiration.
[1] Approval of a preliminary major site plan or subdivision by
the Pleasantville Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case maybe, shall not substitute for or
limit the power of the Atlantic County Planning Board to
review and approve such site plan or subdivision under its
jurisdiction.
[2] Unless a final major site plan and/or final major
subdivision plat covering at least the area designated in
the preliminary major site plan and/or preliminary major
subdivision plat as the first stage or unit of the proposed
development has been filed with the appropriate County
Recording Officer within three years following the date of
the preliminary major site plan and/or preliminary major
subdivision plat approval, or in any case where the
applicant fails to proceed with development in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter and the approved the
Preliminary major site plan and/or Preliminary Major
Subdivision plat or fails in any other manner to comply
with the provisions of this chapter or any approval granted
pursuant to it, the preliminary major site plan and/or
§ 300-36 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-36
285:888
preliminary major subdivision approval shall expire and be
of no further force or effect, unless the Planning Board or
Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, shall,
upon written request of the applicant, waive any failure
of compliance or, to the extent permitted by Subsection
F(2)(i)[3] below, grant an extension of the time specified in
this subsection.
[3] Following the approval of a preliminary major site plan
and/or preliminary major subdivision plat, the Planning
Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be,
may, upon written request of the applicant, grant an
extension of such preliminary approval for additional
periods of at least one year, but not to exceed a total
extension of two years, from the original expiration date of
the preliminary approval; provided, however, that in the
case of a preliminary major site plan and/or preliminary
major subdivision plat for an area of 50 acres or more, the
responsible board may, in originally granting preliminary
approval, provide that the preliminary approval shall not
expire for such period of time, in excess of than three
years, as shall be determined by the such board, taking
into consideration the number of dwelling units and/or
nonresidential floor area permitted pursuant to the
preliminary approval, economic conditions and the
comprehensiveness of the development. In the case of any
such development of 50 acres or more, the applicant may
apply for and the responsible board may grant extensions
of the preliminary approval for such additional periods of
time following the original expiration date as shall be
determined by the Board to be reasonable, taking into
consideration the number of dwelling units and the
nonresidential floor area permitted by the preliminary
approval, the potential number of dwelling units or
nonresidential floor area of the stage or stages of the
development awaiting final approval, economic conditions
and the comprehensiveness of the development. If the
standards for approval of a preliminary major site plan
and/or preliminary major subdivision plat have been
revised at the time a request for extension is made
pursuant to this subsection, the Board may, in its
discretion, apply the revised standards to the request for
extension.
[4] Upon the grant of final approval for any stage or unit of the
proposed development, the time period during which the
preliminary approval is to remain in effect pursuant to this
section shall expire as to that stage or unit.
(j) Site improvements.
§ 300-36 WATER § 300-36
285:889
[1] At any time following the approval of a preliminary major
site plan and/or preliminary major subdivision plat, the
applicant may, pursuant to and subject to the limitations of
the applicable codes and ordinances of the City, apply for
and receive grading permits and approvals necessary for
the installation of public improvements and private roads
within the area of the proposed development for which
preliminary approval has been given.
[2] If expressly authorized by the approval of the preliminary
major site plan and/or preliminary major subdivision plat,
the applicant may, pursuant to and subject to the
limitations of the applicable codes and ordinances of the
City, apply for and receive building permits for model
buildings or temporary structures to be constructed within
the area of the proposed development.
G. Final major site plans and final major subdivisions.
(1) Purpose. A final major site plan and/or final major subdivision plat
shall serve as a complete, thorough and permanent public record of
the proposed development and the manner in which it is to be
developed. The final plan or plat is intended only to add detail to
and to put in final form the information contained in the
preliminary major site plan and/or preliminary major subdivision
plat and shall conform to the preliminary approval in all respects,
and shall incorporate all prior approved plans and all approved
modifications thereof resulting from the site plan/subdivision
approval process and shall be responsive to and in compliance with
all conditions imposed on prior approvals.
(2) Submission and processing of applications.
(a) Applicants shall have three years from the date of Preliminary
major site plan and/or preliminary major subdivision approval
to submit an application for final major site plan and/or final
major subdivision approval.
(b) Applications for final major site plan and/or final major
subdivision approval shall be in such form and shall contain
such information and documentation as is required by
Checklist A and Checklist F, included in § 300-77, and shall be
accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee and escrow
deposit in accordance with § 300-9.
(c) The application may include the entire area of the approved
preliminary major site plan and/or preliminary major
subdivision plat or one or more stages or units thereof in
accordance with a staging plan approved as part of the
preliminary approval. The application shall add necessary
detail to and put in final form the information contained in the
approved preliminary major site plan and/or preliminary major
§ 300-36 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-36
285:890
subdivision plat and shall conform to the approved preliminary
major site plan and/or preliminary major subdivision plat and
all conditions imposed on such approval in all respects.
(d) Upon determination that an applicant has been deemed
complete in accordance with § 300-27, the Planning Board or
Zoning Board Secretary, as the case may be, shall notify the
applicant of the time and place of the hearing on such matter.
(e) Time frames for Board action.
[1] The Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the
case may be, shall act on an application for final major site
plan and/or final major subdivision approval within the
following time periods:
[a] For development requiring variance approval: within
the time allowed for such approval if longer than the
time allowed pursuant to the foregoing subsections.
[b] For all other developments, within 45 days of
determination of a complete application, or within
such further time as may be consented to by the
applicant.
[2] Failure of the Board to act within such time frames shall
constitute approval of the application.
(f) Standard for approval.
[1] No application for final major site plan and/or final major
subdivision approval shall be granted unless the Planning
Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be,
shall find that, based on the information presented to it,
the proposed development and the final plan/plat are in
compliance with each of the standards established for
major site plan and/or major subdivision plats approval
pursuant to this chapter.
[2] The decisions, findings and recommendations of any thirdparty
agency or official who might have jurisdiction over
an application for site plan and/or subdivision approval
shall be reviewed and carefully considered as part of the
deliberations for final major site plan and/or final major
subdivision approval by the Planning Board or Zoning
Board of Adjustment, as the case may be.
[3] Any approval of a preliminary major site plan and/or
preliminary major subdivision by the County Planning
Board shall be noted on the final plan/plat.
(g) Conditions for approval.
§ 300-36 WATER § 300-36
285:891
[1] In granting final major site plan and/or final major
subdivision approval, the Planning Board or Zoning Board
of Adjustment, as the case may be, may impose such
restrictions and conditions upon the approval, the
proposed development or the subject property as may be
necessary, in its opinion, to achieve the purposes of this
chapter and the site plan/subdivision approval process, to
ensure the compliance of the proposed development with
the standards established by this chapter, and to prevent
or minimize any adverse effects of the proposed
development upon properties in the neighborhood and
upon the general health, safety and welfare of the entire
community.
[2] Every final plan/plat approval shall be conditioned upon
the applicant's strict compliance with all the terms,
restrictions and conditions of the approved final plan/plat,
and upon the applicant's continuing compliance with all
applicable laws, ordinances and regulations. All conditions
imposed upon any final plan/plat approval, except to the
extent made applicable to all such approvals by the terms
of this chapter, shall be expressly set forth in the decision
and resolution granting such approval. Violation of any
condition of any such approval shall be a violation of this
chapter and shall be sufficient basis for revoking final site
plan and/or subdivision approval and for denying any
further approval or permit required pursuant to this
chapter or any other ordinance of the City of Pleasantville.
(h) Notice of final approval.
[1] Within 10 days following the date of memorialization of the
Board resolution approving the final major site plan and/or
final major subdivision, or the expiration, without decision,
of the time specified in § 300-36G(2)(e), the Board
Secretary shall publish notice and mail notice thereof to all
parties entitled thereto. Notice to the applicant shall
include a provision informing him/her that properly signed
and approved copies of the final plan/plat as necessary for
Atlantic County review and for recording may be obtained
upon submission of the guaranties required by § 300-49
and the presentation of proof of recording, prior to the sale
of any property to be subject to them, of any documents,
easements, restrictions or covenants required to be
recorded as a condition of final approval.
[2] Approval of the final plan or plat shall be evidenced by the
signature thereon of the Board Secretary, which shall not,
however, be affixed until the applicant has posted the
guaranties required by § 300-49.
§ 300-36 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-36
285:892
[3] In the case of failure of the Board to act on an application
for final major site plan and/or final major subdivision
approval, a certificate evidencing such failure shall be
issued by the Board Secretary Zoning Officer, upon written
request of the applicant and the posting of guaranties as
required by § 300-49.
[4] Such certificate shall be sufficient, in lieu of the written
endorsements herein required, and shall be so accepted by
the Atlantic County Recording Officer for purposes of filing
of approved final major site plans and/or final major
subdivision plats. The date the Board Secretary issues
such certificate shall be the date of final approval.
[5] Published and mailed notice of the final disposition of an
application for final major site plan and/or final major
subdivision approval shall be made in accordance with
§ 300-30G through J.
(i) Recording of final approval. The applicant shall, within 95 days
following the date of memorialization of the Board resolution
approving the application, file an approved final major
subdivision plat with the County Recording Officer. The
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case
may be, may, for good cause shown, extend the period for
recording for an additional period not to exceed 190 days from
the date of final approval. If the applicant fails to record the
plat or plan within the prescribed time, final approval shall
expire.
(j) Limitations on approval/expiration.
[1] Unless an applicant shall fail to comply with any condition
or provision of this chapter or any approval granted
pursuant to it, all rights conferred upon the applicant
pursuant to a final plan/plat approval granted in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, whether
conditionally or otherwise, shall not be changed for a
period of two years or such longer period as may be
established pursuant to the provisions of Subsection
G(2)(j)[3] below after the date of said final approval. The
rights so conferred shall expire if the plat has not been
duly recorded within the time period provided in
Subsection G(2)(i) above.
[2] If the developer has followed the standards prescribed for
final approval and has duly recorded the plat, the Planning
Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be,
may, upon written request of the applicant, extend such
period of protection for up to one year; provided, however,
that not more than three such extensions shall be granted,
§ 300-36 WATER § 300-36
285:893
§ 300-37. Variances.
except pursuant to the provisions of Subsection G(2)(j)[3]
below.
[3] In the case of a site plan/subdivision plat for 150 acres or
more, the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment,
as the case may be, may extend the original period during
which rights conferred pursuant to a final approval shall
not be changed for such period of time, longer than two
years, as it shall determine to be reasonable, taking into
consideration the number of dwelling units and the
nonresidential floor area permissible under the final
approval, economic conditions and the comprehensiveness
of the development. The applicant may thereafter apply for
and the Board may thereafter grant an extension of final
approval for such additional period of time as shall be
determined by the Board to be reasonable, taking into
consideration the number of dwelling units and the
nonresidential floor area permissible under the final
approval, the number of dwelling units and the
nonresidential floor area remaining to be developed,
economic conditions and the comprehensiveness of the
development.
A. Authority. The Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the
case may be, shall, subject to the procedures, standards and limitations
hereinafter set forth, have authority to review and grant or deny
variances from the strict application of this chapter.
B. Purpose and general prohibitions.
(1) The variance procedure is intended to provide a narrowly
circumscribed means by which relief may be granted from
unforeseen particular applications of the provisions of this chapter,
where such provisions create peculiar and exceptional practical
difficulties or exceptional and undue hardships or where special
reasons exist for varying the use and structure restrictions of such
provisions. Only where no other procedure exists to remedy such
difficulty or hardship or to respond to such special reasons is an
application for relief pursuant to this section appropriate.
(2) In adopting this Land Management Code, the City has provided
specific, preordained regulations as well as a variety of
administrative procedures whereby specific properties and uses
may be given individual attention within the confines of a wellstructured
overall plan of development regulation. The variance
procedure is essentially a procedure that operates outside of that
structured plan and is, by its very purpose and definition,
destructive of that plan.
§ 300-36 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-37
285:894
(3) Accordingly, the City Council hereby finds as fact and states as
policy that no relief pursuant to this section may be validly granted
in any case where relief pursuant to any other section of this
chapter is or might be available.
C. "C" variances (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70c).
(1) Reasons for granting variances.
(a) Subject to the general prohibitions of § 300-37B, and to the
other terms and provisions of this section, the Planning Board
or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, may grant
a variance from the strict application of any provision of this
chapter, other than the provisions hereof restricting the uses to
which land and structures may be devoted or the types of
structures which may be located in a district and other than
the provisions hereof restricting the erection of buildings and
structures in public areas mapped on the Official Map or on
lots not abutting a street, upon a showing that:
[1] By reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or
shape of a specific piece of property or by reason of
exceptional topographic conditions or physical features
uniquely affecting the subject property or by reason of an
extraordinary and exceptional situation uniquely affecting
a specific piece of property or the structures lawfully
existing thereon, the strict application of any regulation
pursuant to this chapter would result in peculiar and
exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional and
undue hardship upon the developer of such property; or
[2] The grant of the requested variance would advance one of
the purposes of the New Jersey Municipal Land Use Law
(N.J.S.A. 40:55D-2, adopted by the City of Pleasantville as
§ 300-3).
(b) The grant of a "c" variance shall require the affirmative vote of
a majority of Board members present at the time of the vote.
(2) No "c" variance shall be granted which would result in a substantial
detriment to the public good or a substantial impairment of the
City's Zone Plan.
(3) No "c" variance shall be granted pursuant to this subsection which
would allow a structure or use in a district restricted against such
structure or use. Any variance which would permit, on any lot or
parcel, one or more dwelling units in addition to the number that
would be permitted by a strict application of the provisions of this
chapter shall be considered to be within the prohibition of this
subsection.
§ 300-37 WATER § 300-37
285:895
(4) No "c" variance shall be granted pursuant to this subsection which
would permit the erection of a building or other structure within
the bed of a street or public drainageway, flood control basin or
public area shown on the Official Map of the City or which would
permit erection of a building on a lot which does not abut a street
giving access to such building or structure.
(5) No "c" variance shall be granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment
pursuant to this subsection where the proposed development for
which such variance is sought also requires site plan and/or
subdivision approval, unless such development also requires a
variance under N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d.
D. "D" variances (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d).
(1) Subject to the general prohibitions of § 300-37B, and to the other
terms and provisions of this section, the Zoning Board of
Adjustment may grant a variance to permit a use of a parcel of land
or a structure, or the location of a structure in a zoning district
restricted against such use or structure, upon a showing that:
(a) By reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a
specific piece of property or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions or physical features uniquely affecting
the subject property or by reason of an extraordinary and
exceptional situation uniquely affecting a specific piece of
property or the structures lawfully existing thereon, the strict
application of any regulation pursuant to this act would result
in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or
exceptional and undue hardship upon the developer of such
property; or
(b) The grant of the requested variance would advance one of the
purposes of the New Jersey Municipal Land Use Law (N.J.S.A.
40:55D-2, adopted by the City of Pleasantville as § 300-3); and
(c) The grant of the requested variance would not result in a
substantial detriment to the public good or a substantial
impairment of the goals and purposes of the Master Plan, the
Official Map, any capital improvement program and this
chapter.
(2) The grant of a "d" variance shall require the affirmative vote of five
Board members.
E. Official Map variances (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70b).
(1) Subject to the general prohibitions of § 300-37B, and to the other
terms and provisions of this section, the Board of Adjustment may
grant a variance from the application of § 300-16B(2) and (3) upon
the terms and conditions hereinafter specified:
§ 300-37 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-37
285:896
(a) Variance to erect a building or other structure within a
reserved public area. Whenever one or more parcels of land
upon which is located the bed of a mapped street or public
drainageway, flood control basin or other public area reserved
pursuant to § 300-16B(2) cannot yield a reasonable return to
the owner unless a building permit is granted, the Zoning
Board of Adjustment may grant a variance from the application
of said subsection and direct the issuance of a permit for a
building or structure in such reserved area. Every such
variance shall be limited so as to increase the cost of opening
such street or developing such drainageway, flood control
basin or other public area as little as practicable and to cause
the minimum possible change in the Official Map.
(b) Variance to erect a building or other structure which does not
abut a street. Where the enforcement of § 300-16B(3) requiring
that no building permit be issued for any building or structure
not abutting a street would entail practical difficulty or
unnecessary hardship on an applicant, or where circumstances
do not require the proposed building or structure to be related
to a street, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may grant a
variance from the application of said subsection and direct the
issuance of a building permit for the proposed building or
structure. Every such variance shall be so conditioned as to
assure that adequate access to such building or structure will
be provided for fire-fighting equipment, ambulances and other
emergency vehicles necessary for the protection of health and
safety, and so as to protect any future street layout shown on
the Official Map or on the Circulation Plan Element of the
Master Plan.
(2) The grant of an Official Map variance shall require the affirmative
vote of a majority of the Board members present at the time of the
vote.
F. Submission and processing of applications.
(1) Applications for variance relief shall be in such form and shall
contain such information and documentation as is required by
Checklist A and Checklist H (for "c" variances) and/or Checklist I
(for "d" variances), included in § 300-77, and shall be accompanied
by a nonrefundable application fee and escrow deposit in
accordance with § 300-9.
(2) Upon determination that an application has been deemed complete
in accordance with § 300-27, the Planning Board or Zoning Board
Secretary, as the case may be, shall notify the applicant of the time
and place of the hearing on such matter.
§ 300-37 WATER § 300-37
285:897
(3) The Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case
may be, shall act on an application for variance relief within 120
days following determination of a complete application.
(4) Standard for approval.
(a) The application for a variance shall be denied where the
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case
may be, finds:
[1] That other relief pursuant to this chapter exists to remedy
or respond to the hardship, difficulty or special reason and
the applicant has not sought relief pursuant thereto;
[2] That the grant of the requested variance would result in a
substantial impairment of the goals and purposes of the
Master Plan, the Official Map, any capital improvement
program or this chapter; or
[3] That any ground exists pursuant to this chapter for denial
of the variance.
(b) The failure of the Board to act within 120 days or such longer
period of time as may be agreed to by the applicant shall
constitute approval of the application.
(c) A variance less than or different from that requested may be
granted when the record supports the applicant's right to some
relief but not to the relief requested, provided that the grant of
such variance does not conflict with any public notices
required under § 300-29.
(5) Conditions for approval.
(a) In granting variance approval, the Planning Board or Zoning
Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, may impose such
restrictions and conditions upon the approval, the proposed
use and the premises to be developed or use pursuant to such
approval as may be necessary, in its opinion, to ensure the
compatibility of the proposed use and development with
surrounding development, to ensure the compliance and
consistency of the proposed use and development with the
standards of this chapter and the general purposes, goals and
objectives of this chapter, the Master Plan, any capital
improvement program and the Official Map; and to prevent or
minimize adverse effects from the proposed use and
development upon other properties in the neighborhood and
upon the general health, safety and welfare of the entire City to
the end that no variance granted pursuant to this section shall
result in a substantial detriment to the public good or a
substantial impairment of the land use plans and policies of the
City.
§ 300-37 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-37
285:898
(b) All conditions imposed upon any variance approval, except to
the extent made applicable to all such approvals by this
chapter, shall be expressly set forth in the decision and
resolution granting such approval. The violation of any
condition upon any such approval shall be a violation of this
chapter and shall be sufficient basis for revoking such approval
and for denying any further approval required pursuant to this
chapter or any other ordinance of the City of Pleasantville.
(c) Every variance granted shall be conditioned upon the
developer's continuing compliance with all applicable laws,
ordinances and regulations and all conditions imposed upon
such approval.
(d) Action by applicant.
[1] In the event that a variance is granted or granted subject
to conditions acceptable to the applicant, the applicant
shall, in writing, within 10 days following publication of
notice of such decision pursuant to § 300-30G through I,
acknowledge the grant of such variance and
unconditionally accept and agree to any such conditions.
[2] In the event that an application for a variance is denied or
is approved subject to conditions which are not acceptable
to the applicant, or a variance less than requested is
granted and is unacceptable to the applicant, the applicant
may, within the aforesaid time period, either appeal such
decision to a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to
law or abandon the application.
(6) Effect of approval. The grant of variance relief shall not authorize
the establishment or extension of any use or the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration or moving of any building
or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing and
processing of applications for any permits and approvals which
may be required by the codes and ordinances of the City and other
governmental agencies having jurisdiction, including but not
limited to a zoning permit, building permit and certificate of
occupancy.
(7) Limitations on approval/expiration.
(a) Variances from the terms of this chapter granted by the
Planning Board attendant to a subdivision or site plan approval
permitting the construction or alteration of any building or
structure on any premises shall run co-terminus with such
subdivision or site plan approval. Accordingly, approvals of
such variances are protected as provided for under
§ 300-36E(2)(e), § 300-36F(2)(h) and (i), and § 300-36G(2)(j)
herein.
§ 300-37 WATER § 300-37
285:899
§ 300-38. Interpretations.
(b) Variances from the terms of this chapter granted by the Board
of Adjustment pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d shall expire by
limitation unless, within one year from the adoption of the
decision and resolution of the Board approving such
variance(s), the use or construction or alteration permitted by
such variance shall have actually commenced and is thereafter
diligently pursued to completion.
(c) Any variance from the terms of this chapter granted by the
Board of Adjustment pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70c in
conjunction with a variance under N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d shall
run co-terminus with such ("d") variance.
(d) Any variance from the terms of this chapter granted by the
Board of Adjustment pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70c not
attendant to a variance under N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d shall expire
by limitation unless, within two years from the adoption of the
decision and resolution of the Board approving such
variance(s), the construction or alteration permitted by such
variance shall have actually commenced and is thereafter
diligently pursued to completion.
(e) The running of the period(s) of limitation under the foregoing
subsections shall be stopped from the date of filing of an
appeal from such decision of the Board in accordance with
§ 300-12P, until such appeal has been finally resolved.
(f) In addition to the other penalties and remedies for violations of
this chapter, it shall be a condition of every variance granted
pursuant to this section that such variance may be revoked for
violation of any condition imposed upon such variance either
by the provisions of this chapter or by the provisions of the
decision and resolution granting such variance; provided,
however, that no such variance shall be revoked except by
resolution of the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be, adopted following a public
hearing, noticed and conducted by the Board in the same
manner as provided for the original granting of the variance,
whereat the existence of such violation is established.
A. Authority. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may, subject to the
procedures, standards and limitations set forth herein, render
interpretations of any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation
issued pursuant to it, including interpretations of the various permitted
uses detailed in this chapter and the permissibility of any use not
expressly detailed in this chapter.
B. Purpose. The provisions of this section are intended to provide:
§ 300-37 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-38

(1) A simple and expeditious method for clarifying ambiguities in the
text of this chapter, the Zoning Map which it incorporates and the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant hereto; and
(2) A simple, yet circumscribed, procedure for overcoming inadvertent
rigidities and limitations inherent in the promulgation of finite use
lists in a world characterized by infinite permutations of essentially
similar uses.
C. Submission and processing of applications.
(1) All requests for interpretation of any provision of this chapter, the
Zoning Map or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this
chapter shall be made, in writing, to the Zoning Board Secretary,
shall be in such form and shall contain such information and
documentation as is required by Checklist A and Checklist G,
included in § 300-77, and shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable
application fee and escrow deposit in accordance with § 300-9.
Each such request shall set forth the specific provision or
provisions to be interpreted, the facts of the specific situation
giving rise to the request for interpretation and the precise
interpretation asserted by the applicant to be correct. Before the
rendering of any interpretation, the Zoning Board of Adjustment
may require such further facts and information as are necessary to
a meaningful interpretation of the provision in question.
(2) The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall act on an application for
interpretation within 120 days following determination of a
complete application. In so doing, the Board shall state the specific
precedent and the reasons and analysis upon which such
interpretation is based.
(3) The failure of the Board of Adjustment to act within 120 days, or
within such other time as may be consented to by the applicant,
shall be deemed to be a rejection of the applicant's proposed
interpretation.
D. Standards for use interpretations. The following conditions shall govern
the Zoning Board of Adjustment in issuing use interpretations:
(1) No use interpretation shall allow the establishment of any use
which was previously considered and rejected by the Planning
Board or by the Zoning Board of Adjustment on an application for
amendment or on an application for a use variance.
(2) No use interpretation shall permit a specifically prohibited use to
be established in any such district or any more restrictive district.
(3) No use interpretation shall permit a use listed as a permitted or
conditional use in any district to be established in any district in
which such use is not so listed.
§ 300-38 WATER § 300-38
285:901
(4) No use interpretation shall permit any use in a particular district
unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in
such district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses
permitted or conditionally permitted in a less restrictive district.
E. Effect of favorable use interpretations. No use interpretation finding a
particular use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific
district shall authorize the establishment of such use nor the
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration or moving of any
building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing
and processing of applications for any permits and approvals which may
be required by the codes and ordinances of the City or other
governmental agencies having jurisdiction, including but not limited to
site plan and/or subdivision approval, zoning permit, building permit
and certificate of occupancy.
F. Limitations on use interpretations/expiration.
(1) No use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or
conditionally permitted in a specified district shall be valid for a
period longer than one year from the date of issue, unless a
building permit is issued and construction actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or a
certificate of occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within
that period.
(2) A use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or
conditionally permitted in a specified district shall be deemed to
authorize only the particular use at the particular location for
which it was issued, and such permit shall not be deemed to
authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate use
interpretation has not been issued.
G. Maintenance of records; annual report.
(1) The Zoning Board Secretary shall keep a record of each use
interpretation rendered and shall include a report of all such
interpretations in his/her annual report.
(2) Such report shall include a recommendation of the Zoning Board
regarding any amendments to this chapter for the addition of new
uses to reflect the use interpretations given pursuant to this
section.
H. Failure to amend regulations. In any case where, upon the expiration of
one year following the receipt of the recommendations of the Zoning
Board pursuant to § 300-38G(2), the City Council shall have failed to
adopt an ordinance amendment with respect to any use interpretation
included in such recommendation:
(1) No use authorized pursuant to such interpretation, but not yet
established or under construction, shall be established.
§ 300-38 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-38
285:902
§ 300-39. Appeals.
(2) Any use authorized and established pursuant to such interpretation
shall be permitted to continue, subject to the provisions of § 300-20
regarding nonconformities.
(3) No similar use interpretation shall be given in the future.
A. Authority.
(1) The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have authority to hear and
decide appeals from any order, decision, requirement or refusal of
an Administrative Officer based on or made in the enforcement of
this chapter or the Official Map, and to that end it shall have all of
the same powers and be subject to all of the same standards and
limitations as said Administrative Officer with respect to any order,
decision, requirement or refusal being appealed.
(2) Accordingly, any interested party affected by any order, decision,
requirement or refusal of an Administrative Officer based on or

of appeal shall have been filed, that, by reason of facts stated in
the certificate, a stay would, in his/her opinion, cause imminent
peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be

notice to appeal, or within such further time as may be
consented to by the applicant. Such decision may reverse or
affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the appealed order,
decision, requirement or refusal.
(c) The failure of the Zoning Board of Adjustment to render a
decision within the aforesaid 120 days, or such longer period of
time as may be agreed to by the appellant, shall constitute a
decision favorable to the appellant.
(3) Right to grant variance. In any case where the notice of appeal is
accompanied by an application for variance in accordance with
§ 300-37, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have the authority
to grant, as part of the relief, a variance, but only in strict
compliance with each provision of such section.
(4) Effect of conditions and limitations on appeals granted. In any case
where this chapter imposes or permits the imposition of conditions
and limitations upon any right, any such right granted by the

the case may be, shall find that, in addition to complying with each of
the standards made applicable to site plans and subdivision plats by this
chapter, the proposed development complies, except to the extent waived,
varied or modified pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, with all of
the standards and conditions applicable in the zoning district in which it is
proposed to be located; complies with any special standards applicable to
the particular type of development being proposed or to the particular area
in which the development is proposed or to any special approvals required
in connection with such a development or area; and complies with all other
federal, state, county and City laws, ordinances and regulations applicable
to it.
§ 300-45. Adequacy of public improvements.
A. No application for site plan and/or subdivision plat approval shall be
granted unless the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as
the case may be, shall find, pursuant to the provisions of this section,
that the proposed use in the proposed location is or can and will be, by
reason of the developer's compliance with conditions imposed pursuant
to the provisions of this section, adequately served by and will not
impose an undue burden upon the public improvements, sites and
rights-of-way by which it will be served or benefited or which exist or
are planned for installation within its boundaries or their immediate
vicinity.
B. Determination of necessary public improvements and special benefits.
(1) Whenever an application for site plan and/or subdivision plat
approval is filed with the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be, pursuant to this chapter, the Board
shall determine what, if any, public improvements, whether ontract
or off-tract, are to be installed, constructed, improved or
rehabilitated to serve or benefit the proposed development, and
shall also determine whether any part of the subject property
should be reserved for use as a public site or right-of-way. The
Board shall base its determination on:
(a) The nature and scope of the proposed development.
(b) The provisions of this chapter specifically applicable to the
type of development being proposed.
(c) The provisions of the Master Plan, Capital Improvement
Program, if any, Official Map and any other plans, programs or
§ 300-44 WATER § 300-45
285:915
maps adopted by or under consideration pursuant to public
notice by the City or other governmental agencies having
jurisdiction to guide growth and development.
(d) The provisions of this chapter and other development
regulations adopted by the City or other governmental
agencies having jurisdiction, with particular attention to any
such provisions specifically applicable to the type of
development being proposed or the area in which it is
proposed and special restrictions or conditions on such
developments or areas, and the studies, reports and opinions
of City departments, officials and consultants having special
knowledge, expertise or responsibility with respect to the
development, improvements or conditions under
consideration.
(2) In determining whether the installation, construction,
improvement or rehabilitation of a public improvement is
necessary to serve the proposed development, the Planning Board
or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, shall be guided
by the principle that no new development should be allowed to
utilize existing capacity of a public improvement unless such
improvement, in its existing condition or with such improvements
as have already been authorized for completion as general
improvements to be paid for out of public funds already
appropriated for the purpose, has adequate capacity to meet the
full demands that would be placed upon it if all reasonably
foreseeable public and private development planned or permitted
pursuant to the Master Plan and chapter were to occur.
(3) In the event that the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be, shall determine, pursuant to
Subsection B(1) above, that one or more on-site public
improvements are necessary to serve the proposed development,
the Board shall require the installation of such improvements as a
condition to the approval of any site plan and/or subdivision plat. In
such event, the developer shall, as provided in § 300-45D, estimate
the cost thereof and provide such information to the City Engineer.
(4) In the event that the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be, shall determine, pursuant to
Subsection B(1) above, that either a public site or a public right-ofway
or public improvement that will not serve the subject
development is required on the subject tract, the applicant shall
proceed as provided in § 300-45E.
(5) In the event that the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be, shall determine, pursuant to
Subsection B(1) above, that one or more off-tract public
improvements are necessary to serve the subject development, the
Board shall determine, as to each such improvement, whether the
§ 300-45 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-45
285:916
improvement will specially benefit only the subject property or will
benefit other properties in addition to the subject property.
(6) In the case of any such improvement that will benefit only the
subject property, the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be, shall require the installation of
such improvement. In such event, the developer shall, as provided
in § 300-45F, estimate the cost thereof and provide such
information to the City Engineer.
(7) In the case of any such improvement that will benefit other
properties in addition to the subject property, the Planning Board
or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, shall determine
the extent to which each benefited property, including the subject
property, is benefited and also the extent to which the improvement
results in a general benefit not specifically attributable to any
specific property and shall apportion the cost of such improvement
and require its installation. In such event, the developer shall, as
provided in § 300-45G, estimate the cost and apportionment
thereof and provide such information to the City Engineer.
(8) In determining which properties are specifically benefited by a
public improvement, the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be, shall be governed by the
interpretation given by the New Jersey Supreme Court to the term
"special or peculiar benefit" in N.J.S.A. 40:56-27. In apportioning
the benefit among the benefited properties and the general benefit,
the Board shall be generally guided by the principles applicable to
the apportionment of special benefits in connection with local
improvements subject to N.J.S.A. 40:56-1 et seq.
(9) When, in performing its duties hereunder, the Planning Board or
Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, determines that a
property, other than the subject property, will be benefited by an
improvement to be installed as a condition of its approval of the
subject application, it shall require the developer to give the owner
of each such property, as shown in the latest property tax records,
notice thereof. The Board shall provide such entities a reasonable
opportunity to be heard thereon and shall either delay approval of
the subject application pending such notice and hearing, or shall
condition such approval to permit revisions in its determination
made pursuant to this subsection based upon information obtained
at such hearing.
(10) In performing its duties hereunder, the Planning Board or Zoning
Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, shall enlist the assistance
of the City Engineer or such other City officials, employees and
consultants as have special knowledge or expertise in estimating
and apportioning the costs and benefits of public improvements.
§ 300-45 WATER § 300-45
285:917
(11) The requirements for public improvements and the developers'
responsibility with respect to their provision and installation
pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to be the minimum
requirements applicable to all developments requiring site plan/
subdivision approval but otherwise permitted as a matter of right in
the zoning district proposed. Additional requirements applicable to
developments requiring certain discretionary approvals pursuant
to the provisions of this chapter may be imposed pursuant to
§ 300-45H.
C. On-tract public improvements serving the subject development.
(1) The developer of every proposed development shall be required, as
a condition of any approval pursuant to this chapter, to provide all
on-tract, whether on-site or off-site, public improvements to which
the subject development will be connected or by which it will be
served or benefited.
(a) Except as noted in Subsection C(2) below, all such
improvements shall be designed, sized and installed in
accordance with the Master Plan, any capital improvement
program, the Official Map, this chapter, and such other plans,
programs, maps and ordinances adopted by or under
consideration pursuant to public notice by the City or other
governmental agencies having jurisdiction to guide growth and
development at the time the first application in connection
with such development is filed.
(b) In the absence of any such plan, program, map or ordinance,
the public improvements shall be required, designed, sized and
installed in accordance with the City Engineer's determination
based on good engineering practice and all available
information concerning present and future needs. The cost of
providing and installing such improvements shall be paid in
accordance with the provisions of Subsection C(3) below.
(2) The Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case
may be, may, as a condition of any approval required to be given by
it pursuant to this chapter, require the installation of a public
improvement of greater size or capacity than required by
Subsection C(1) above when it deems such greater size or capacity
to be necessary in light of factors not known or considered at the
time the aforesaid plan, program, map or ordinance was adopted or
placed under consideration. If such factors relate solely to the
development under consideration, the increased cost due to
installing such greater size or capacity public improvement shall be
paid in accordance with the provisions of Subsection C(3) below. If
such factors do not relate solely to such development, such
increased cost shall be paid in the same manner as provided in
§ 300-45G for off-tract improvements benefiting more than one
tract.
§ 300-45 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-45
285:918
(3) Except as provided in Subsection C(2) above, it shall be a condition
of every approval granted pursuant to this chapter that all public
improvements required to be installed pursuant to this subsection
shall be installed at the sole cost and expense of the developer. The
City Engineer shall, as part of his/her review of detailed plans,
specifications and cost estimates pursuant to § 300-49, estimate
the cost of all such improvements, and the developer shall, as a
condition to final plan/plat approval, provide performance and
maintenance guaranties pursuant to § 300-49, to ensure the timely
and proper installation of such improvements. The developer shall
be responsible for installing all improvements required pursuant to
this subsection, and for that purpose shall engage only properly
licensed and qualified contractors and subcontractors for the type
of work involved; provided, however, that where an ongoing or
proposed City Public Improvement Program offers a more efficient
and orderly vehicle for installing such improvements, the Planning
Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, may
require such improvements to be installed by the City as part of
such program and require the developer to pay the cost thereof.
D. On-tract public sites, on-tract public rights-of-way and public
improvements not serving the subject development.
(1) Whenever the Master Plan, Capital Improvement Program, Official
Map or other plan, program, map or ordinance adopted, or under
consideration pursuant to official notice, by the City provides for
the reservation on the subject property of a public site not
associated with a public improvement or for the reservation of a
public right-of-way or the installation of a public improvement,
which right-of-way or improvement will not serve or benefit the
subject tract, the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment,
as the case may be, may, pursuant to the procedure set out in
Subsection D(3) below and as a condition of any approval required
pursuant to this chapter, require such site, right-of-way or
improvement to be shown on the plans or plats of the proposed
development in a manner, size and location consistent with the City
plan, program, map or ordinance in question and may reserve the
necessary land areas for such site, right-of-way or improvement for
a period of one year or such further time as may be agreed to by the
developer following final site plan subdivision plat approval. Unless
during such period, or an agreed extension thereof, the City shall
have entered into a contract to purchase, or shall have instituted
condemnation proceedings according to law to acquire, the fee or a
lesser interest in the reserved land area, the developer shall not be
bound by such reservation and may proceed to use such land for
private use in accordance with applicable development regulations.
(2) The developer shall be entitled to just compensation for the actual
loss found to be caused by any temporary reservation and
deprivation of use pursuant to Subsection D(1) above. Unless a
§ 300-45 WATER § 300-45
285:919
lesser amount has been mutually agreed upon, just compensation
shall be deemed to be the fair market value of an option to
purchase the land reserved for the period of reservation, provided
that determination of such fair market value shall include, but not
be limited to, consideration of the real property taxes apportioned
to the land reserved and prorated for the period of reservation.
(3) The developer shall also be compensated for the reasonable
increased cost of legal, engineering or other professional services
incurred as a result of the reservation in connection with obtaining
site plan and/or subdivision approval. The compensation payable
pursuant to this subsection shall be determined in accordance with
the provisions of Subsection D(4) below.
(4) Upon submission to the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be, of an application for site plan and/
or subdivision approval for a land area subject to reservation
pursuant to Subsection D(1) above, the Board Secretary shall, in
addition to the usual distribution of such application, forward a
copy thereof to the City Council with a report summarizing the
provisions of the City plan, program, map or ordinance, indicating
the need for the reservation, providing a current assessment of the
public need for such reservation and setting forth the date upon
which the Board is expected to take final action on the application.
Before such date, the City Council shall decide upon, and give the
Board notice of, one of the following courses of action to be
followed:
(a) The City shall forego the right to reserve the land area in
question. The Board then shall consider the proposed
development as if no such right existed.
(b) The City Council has, prior to the date set for final action on the
application, negotiated a price for the acquisition of any
interests in land necessary, a program for the installation of
any public improvements and an agreement as to any
incidental compensation which may be due, and all approvals
granted by the Board shall reflect such agreements.
(c) The Board shall exercise the right of reservation pursuant to
Subsection D(1) above, and the City Council shall negotiate
just compensation for the reserved land or shall institute
condemnation proceedings during the reservation period.
(5) Should the City Council fail to so notify the Planning Board or
Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, the Board shall
proceed as if notified and pursue the course of action set out in
Subsection D(4)(a) above.
(6) Should the City Council elect to proceed pursuant to Subsection
D(4)(c) above and then fail to negotiate compensation or to
institute condemnation proceedings during the reservation period,
§ 300-45 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-45
285:920
the reservation shall expire, and the City Council shall, within 30
days following the end of the reservation period, tender to the
developer an amount considered by it to be just compensation for
all compensable claims of the developer, pursuant to Subsection
D(1) above, arising out of the temporary reservation. The developer
shall either accept and, in writing, acknowledge his acceptance
of such tender in full settlement of his claim for compensation or
shall institute an appropriate action for judicial determination and
enforcement of his claim.
E. Off-tract public improvements specially benefiting only the subject
development.
(1) The developer of every proposed development shall be required, as
a condition of the grant of any approval pursuant to this chapter, to
provide all off-tract public improvements which are necessary to
serve or which benefit the subject property and which provide no
special benefit to any other property. Except as noted in Subsection
E(2) below, all such improvements shall be required, designed,
sized and installed in accordance with the Master Plan, Capital
Improvement Program, if any, Official Map, this chapter and such
other plans, programs, maps and ordinances adopted by or under
consideration pursuant to public notice by the City or other
governmental agencies having jurisdiction to guide growth and
development at the time the first application in connection with
such development is filed. In the absence of any such plan,
program, map or ordinance, the public improvements shall be
required, designed, sized and installed in accordance with the City
Engineer's determination based on good engineering practice and
all available information concerning present and future needs. The
cost of providing and installing such improvements shall be paid in
accordance with the provisions of Subsection E(3) below.
(2) The Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case
may be may, as a condition of any approval required to be given by
it pursuant to this chapter, require the installation of a public
improvement of greater size or capacity than required by
Subsection E(1) above when it deems such greater size or capacity
to be necessary in light of factors not known or considered at the
time the aforesaid plan, program, map or ordinance was adopted or
placed under consideration. If such factors relate solely to the
development under consideration, the increased cost due to
installing such greater size or capacity public improvement shall be
paid in accordance with Subsection E(3) below. If such factors do
not relate solely to such development, such increased cost shall be
paid in the same manner as provided in Subsection F below for offtract
improvements benefiting more than one tract.
(3) Except as provided in Subsection E(2) above, it shall be a condition
of every approval granted pursuant to this chapter that all public
improvements required to be installed pursuant to this subsection
§ 300-45 WATER § 300-45
285:921
shall be installed at the sole cost and expense of the developer.
The City Engineer shall, as part of his review of detailed plans,
specifications and cost estimates pursuant to § 300-49, estimate
the cost of all such improvements, and the developer shall, as a
condition to final plan or plat approval, provide performance and
maintenance guaranties pursuant to § 300-49 to ensure the timely
and proper installation of such improvements. The developer shall
be responsible for installing all improvements required pursuant
to this subsection, and for that purpose shall engage only such
properly licensed and qualified contractors and subcontractors as
have been approved by the City Engineer for the type of work
involved; provided, however, that where an ongoing or proposed
City Public Improvement Program offers a more efficient and
orderly vehicle for installing such improvements, the Board may
require such improvements to be installed by the City as part of
such program and require the developer to pay the cost thereof.
F. Off-tract improvements specifically benefiting more than the subject
development.
(1) Except as provided in Subsection F(3) below, the developer of every
proposed development shall be required, as a condition of the grant
of any approval pursuant to this chapter, to provide all off-tract
public improvements which are necessary to serve, or which
benefit, the subject property, even though such improvements may
also specially benefit other properties. Except as noted in
Subsection F(2) below, all such improvements shall be required,
designed, sized and installed in accordance with the Master Plan,
Capital Improvement Program, if any, Official Map, this chapter
and such other plans, programs, maps and ordinances adopted by
or under consideration pursuant to public notice by the City or
other governmental agencies having jurisdiction to guide growth
and development at the time the first application in connection with
such development is filed. In the absence of any such plan,
program, map or ordinance, the public improvements shall be
required, designed, sized and installed in accordance with the City
Engineer's determination based on good engineering practice and
all available information concerning present and future needs. The
cost of providing and installing such improvements shall be paid in
accordance with the provisions of Subsection F(3) below.
(2) The Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case
may be, may, as a condition of any approval required to be given by
it pursuant to this chapter, require the installation of a public
improvement of greater size or capacity than required by
Subsection F(1) above when it deems such greater size or capacity
to be necessary in light of factors not known or considered at the
time the aforesaid plan, program, map or ordinance was adopted or
placed under consideration. The costs due to installing such
§ 300-45 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-45
285:922
greater size or capacity shall be apportioned and paid in the same
manner as other costs pursuant to Subsection F(3) below.
(3) It shall be a condition of every approval granted pursuant to this
chapter, that all public improvements required to be installed
pursuant to this subsection shall be installed at the sole cost and
expense of the developer. Such approval shall, however, provide
that the developer shall be entitled to reimbursement (recapture)
in the manner and to the extent authorized by Subsection F(4)
below.
(4) Determination of reimbursement/recapture amount.
(a) Whenever a public improvement, or any portion thereof,
required to be installed pursuant to this subsection is installed
at the sole cost and expense of a developer, or at any cost and
expense to such developer greater than his pro rata share of
the cost of such improvement as specified in Subsection F(3),
the developer shall be entitled to reimbursement of his costs
and expenses if, when and as other properties determined to
be specifically benefited by such improvement subsequently
seek approval for any development that will be served or
benefited by such improvement. The amount of such
reimbursement shall not exceed the difference between the
amount of such cost and expense paid by such developer and
such developer's pro rata share of the cost of such
improvement.
(b) In any such case, the approval of the application for the subject
property shall include a determination by the Planning Board
or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, pursuant
to this section, of all properties specially benefited by the
improvement and of the value to each such property. The
results of said determination and notice of the obligations on
each property pursuant thereto shall be recorded by the
Zoning Officer in the records of the Atlantic County Recording
Officer with respect to each such benefited property.
(c) Thereafter, no approval or permit required by this chapter or
any other ordinance of the City with respect to any subsequent
development resulting in the use of, connection to or
enjoyment of any benefit from such improvement by any such
benefited property shall be granted or issued unless and until
the subsequent developer of such benefited property shall have
paid the original developer and any other prior developers
contributing to the cost and expense of such improvement an
amount calculated pursuant to the following formula, which
was developed to establish a fair cost-sharing for off-site
infrastructure extensions. Such formula's primary ingredients
are:
§ 300-45 WATER § 300-45
285:923
[1] Capacity usage from each participant as a portion of the
total capacity of the system and the extension quantity
(typically distance or area), which ultimately equates to
cost.
[2] Pro-rata cost share shall be calculated by multiplying the
recapture amount by the anticipated usage divided by the
total estimated usage of the affected portion of the system.
The recapture amount is the total estimated or actual
improvement cost less the subject tract improvement cost.
By way of example:
Roadway Reimbursement =
Length of Property Line along Roadway x Cost of One
l.f. of Road\Two x Half Width of Roadway
Where Cost of One l.f. of
Road =
Total Cost of Road
Construction\Total Length of
Road
Storm Sewer Reimbursement =
Acreage of Property to be Developed x Cost of One
Unit of Storm Sewer Infrastructure
Where Cost of One Unit of Storm Sewer
Infrastructure =
Total Cost of Storm Sewer
Construction\Total Acreage
to be Serviced by Storm
Sewer1
Sanitary Sewer Reimbursement =
Total Cost for Pipe
Installation\Total Number of
EDUs* to be Serviced
NOTES:
1 Including acreage within rights-of-way.
* The City Engineer shall determine other existing or
potential off-site development that may benefit from
the proposed improvements and shall take any EDUs1
anticipated from such development into consideration
when making his/her determination of usage.
§ 300-45 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-45
285:924
§ 300-46. Elimination of impacts of specified developments.
1 Equivalent Dwelling Unit. Assumes one EDU = one
single-family dwelling. The City Engineer shall
determine an appropriate EDU factor for apartments,
condominiums or other multifamily residential
development.
For commercial development, the City engineer shall
estimate the sewer usage for the proposed use. For
the purpose of determining reimbursement, it will be
assumed that one EDU is equivalent to 300 gallons per
day of sewer discharge.
For sizing new pump stations or upgrades to existing
pump stations, the capacity of the station or increased
capacity in gallons per day will be converted to EDUs
by assuming one EDU to be equivalent to 300 gallons
per day.
For other improvements to the system, the City
Engineer will determine the total number of benefited
users to share in the cost of the improvement.
[3] The City Engineer shall use the foregoing formula as a
guide and shall be empowered to make adjustments as he/
she deems necessary based on the individual
circumstances encountered.
[4] The procedures described herein apply to public utilities
only. Provisions for recapture of costs for the installation of
infrastructure provided by private utility companies [i.e.,
New Jersey American Water (potable water), South Jersey
Gas (natural gas), Atlantic City Electric (electricity)] shall
be as determined by the private utility provider.
A. General standard.
(1) The requirements set forth in § 300-45 for public improvements
and public sites shall be deemed the minimum requirements
necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare in
connection with all developments requiring site plan and/or
subdivision approval but otherwise permitted as a matter of right
as permitted uses in the various zoning districts established by this
chapter.
(2) In addition to such requirements, the Planning Board or Zoning
Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, shall have authority, in
connection with its review and approval of any site plan and/or
subdivision plat for any proposed development requiring variance
approval, to impose as a condition on any of said discretionary
approvals and on any related site plan and/or subdivision approval
§ 300-45 WATER § 300-46
285:925
pursuant to this chapter, additional requirements intended and
designed to eliminate or ameliorate the physical, economic and
social impacts of the proposed development on its immediate
environs and on the general health, safety and welfare of the City
and its residents and visitors.
(3) No application for such a development shall be granted unless the
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be,
shall find, pursuant to the provisions of § 300-46B and the
provisions of this chapter applicable to the granting of the
aforesaid discretionary approvals, that the proposed use in the
proposed location will not result in any undue adverse physical,
economic or social impacts upon its immediate environs or the
general health, safety and welfare of the City, its residents and its
visitors, which will not be eliminated by reason of the developer's
compliance with conditions imposed pursuant to § 300-46B and the
provisions of this chapter applicable to the aforesaid discretionary
approvals.
B. Determination of need for special conditions.
(1) Whenever an application for site plan and/or subdivision approval
for a development requiring variance approval is filed with the
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be,
pursuant to this chapter, the Board shall determine what, if any,
conditions on those approvals, in addition to or in lieu of conditions
to be imposed pursuant to § 300-45, are necessary to eliminate any
undue, adverse physical, economic or social impacts of the
proposed development on its immediate environs and on the
general health, safety and welfare of the City, its residents,
businesses and visitors. Such conditions may relate to the
provisions of:
(a) Public improvements;
(b) Public sites and rights-of-way;
(c) On-tract and on-site improvements, facilities, landscaping and
amenities and services; and
(d) Contributions to general public programs and projects
designed to respond to the adverse impact in question; or
(e) Any other matter found by the Board to be reasonably
necessary to eliminate any undue adverse physical, economic
or social impact which would be imposed by or have a rational
nexus with the proposed development.
(2) The Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case
may be, shall base its determination on:
(a) The nature and scope of the proposed development;
§ 300-46 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-46
285:926
(b) The provisions of this chapter specifically applicable to the
type of development being proposed and the specific type of
discretionary approval sought;
(c) The provisions of the Master Plan, Capital Improvement
Program, if any, Official Map and any other plans, programs or
maps adopted by or under consideration pursuant to notice by
the City or other governmental agencies having jurisdiction to
guide growth and development;
(d) The provisions of this chapter and other development
regulations adopted by the City or other governmental
agencies having jurisdiction, with particular attention to any
such provisions specifically applicable to the type of
development being proposed or the area in which it is
proposed and any special restrictions or conditions on such
development or areas; and
(e) The studies, reports and opinions of City departments, officials
and consultants having special knowledge, expertise or
responsibility with respect to the development, improvements
or conditions under consideration.
(3) In determining whether conditions are necessary to eliminate
adverse impacts of a development requiring variance approval, the
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be,
shall be guided by the principles set forth in § 300-45, and by the
following additional principles:
(a) That such approvals are discretionary;
(b) That the uses permitted by right in the various zoning districts
reflect a careful balancing of the rights of the owners against
the lawfully cognizable concerns of the public;
(c) That uses requiring variance approval are placed in a special
category because they impose unusual burdens on the public
while conferring special benefits on the owner; and
(d) That the public has the right and duty to insist that those
seeking such special benefits accept the responsibility for
responding to and eliminating those unusual burdens which
are found to have a rational nexus with the special approval
sought or the development proposed.
(4) Neither the fact that a specific condition could have been imposed
pursuant to § 300-45 nor the fact that such a condition is not
authorized by said subsection shall prevent its imposition pursuant
to this section in the case of any development variance approval
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

(5) In the event that the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be, shall determine, pursuant to this
section, that conditions are required to eliminate any undue
adverse physical, economic or social impacts of a development
requiring variance approval, it shall condition its grant of the
aforesaid approvals and its grant of site plan and/or subdivision
approval pursuant to this chapter as necessary to eliminate such
impacts.
C. The cost of meeting any condition imposed pursuant to this section shall

reimbursement to the extent and in the manner provided in § 300-45E
on the basis of the extent of the cost and expense of meeting the
condition imposed in relation to the value of the development for which
variance approval is sought, the degree to which the condition will
specifically benefit other specific properties and the degree to which
the subject property has or is likely to benefit, without cost or expense,
from similar conditions imposed upon other properties seeking similar
discretionary approvals. In the event that the Board shall make such
determination, the provisions of § 300-45 with respect thereto shall
apply.

§ 300-49.5 WATER § 300-49.8
285:935
thereunder, provided that such improvements have been inspected and
have received final approval by the City Engineer.
§ 300-50. Inspection of improvements, facilities and work.
A. During construction.
(1) All improvements, facilities and work required to be constructed
pursuant to an approved final plan or plat shall be regularly
inspected by the City Engineer and the Zoning Officer for
compliance with the approved plans, decision and resolution of the
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be,
the provisions of this chapter and the requirements of all other
applicable federal, state, county and City laws, ordinances and
regulations. If, as a result of such inspections, the City Engineer or
the Zoning Officer shall determine that any improvement, facility or
work is not in compliance with said plans, decision and resolution,
laws, ordinances or regulations, he or she shall have authority to
order that all or any part of the work on the development shall be
stopped until such time as necessary steps are taken to correct any
defects or deficiencies.
(2) In order to facilitate the regular inspection program herein
required, the applicant shall notify the City Engineer at least 48
hours prior to the surfacing of any street or private road; the
installation of any curbing, gutters, sanitary or storm drainage
structures, underground utilities or other improvements; or the
grading or backfilling of any open trench or excavation in which
any public improvement has been installed. Within 48 hours
following the receipt of such notice, the City Engineer shall conduct
an on-site inspection of such work.
(3) The above notwithstanding, nothing herein shall limit the ability of
the City Engineer to perform regular and routine inspections of
construction as necessary and appropriate.
B. Inspection escrow. [Added 6-18-2018 by Ord. No. 7-2018]
(1) The obligor shall reimburse the municipality for reasonable
inspection fees paid to the City Engineer for the inspections of
improvements required under § 300-49, which fees shall not exceed
the sum of the amounts set forth in Subsection B(1)(a) and (b) of
this section. The municipality may require the developer to post the
inspection fees in escrow in an amount:
(a) Not to exceed, except for extraordinary circumstances, the
greater of $500 or 5% of the cost of bonded improvements that
are subject to a performance guaranty under § 300-49.1A; and
(b) Not to exceed 5% of the cost of private site improvements that
are not subject to a performance guaranty under § 300-49.1A,
§ 300-49.8 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-50
285:936
which cost shall be determined pursuant to Section 15 of P.L.
1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4).
(2) For those developments for which the inspection fees total less
than $10,000, fees may, at the option of the developer, be paid in
two installments. The initial amount deposited in escrow by a
developer shall be 50% of the inspection fees. When the balance on
deposit drops to 10% of the inspection fees because the amount
deposited by the developer has been reduced by the amount paid to
the City Engineer for inspections, the developer shall deposit the
remaining 50% of the inspection fees.
(3) For those developments for which the inspection fees total $10,000
or greater, fees may, at the option of the developer, be paid in four
installments. The initial amount deposited in escrow by a developer
shall be 25% of the inspection fees. When the balance on deposit
drops to 10% of the inspection fees because the amount deposited
by the developer has been reduced by the amount paid to the City
Engineer for inspection, the developer shall make additional
deposits of 25% of the inspection fees.
(4) If the municipality determines that the amount in escrow for the
payment of inspection fees, as calculated pursuant to
§ 300-50B(1)(a) and (b), is insufficient to cover the cost of
additional required inspections, the municipality may require the
developer to deposit additional funds in escrow, provided that the
municipality delivers to the developer a written inspection escrow
deposit request, signed by the City Engineer, which informs the
developer of the need for additional inspections, details the items
or undertakings that require inspection, estimates the time
required for those inspections, and estimates the cost of
performing those inspections.
C. Additional inspections by zoning officer. Following final plan or plat
approval, the Zoning Officer shall, in addition to the inspections
required pursuant to § 300-50 in connection with the installation of
improvements and facilities, at least once every six months until the
completion of the development, and continually thereafter following
completion of the development, review all permits issued and
construction undertaken and compare actual development with the
approved plans for development and with the approved development
schedule.
(1) If the Zoning Officer finds that development is not proceeding in
accordance with the approved schedule, or that it fails in any other
respect to comply with the plans or plats as finally approved, he
shall immediately notify the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be, of such fact and may, if he finds it
necessary to ensure compliance with the approved plans or plats,
the decision and resolution and the provisions of this chapter, issue
§ 300-50 WATER § 300-50
285:937
an order stopping any or all work on the development until such
time as any noncompliance is cured.
(2) Board actions.
(a) Within 30 days following such notice, the Planning Board or
Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, shall take one
or more of the following actions as it shall deem appropriate:
[1] Compel the applicant to return to the Board for a formal
explanation of the noncompliance;
[2] Commence such steps as it shall deem necessary to
compel compliance with the final plan or plat approval;
[3] Revoke, by resolution, the final plan or plat approval and
all prior approvals and related or resulting permits; and/or
[4] Pursue such other remedies as may be available to enforce
compliance with this chapter and to punish any failure to
comply.
(b) The exercise of any of the foregoing actions shall in no way bar
or limit the taking of any other of the foregoing actions if, in the
discretion of the Board, such actions are appropriate.
D. Reduction of guaranties; notice of default to obligor and surety.
(1) If, as a result of the foregoing regular inspection program, the City
Engineer shall determine that portions of the required
improvements, facilities or work have been completed so as to
justify a reduction in the amount of the performance guaranty
posted by the applicant, he shall certify such facts to the City
Council, which may, thereupon, reduce the amount of the
performance guaranty to a sum not less than 120% of the cost of
the improvements, facilities and work yet to be completed.
(2) If, as a result of the foregoing regular inspection program, the City
Engineer determines that any of the required improvements,
facilities or work has not been or is not being performed or
corrected in accordance with the approved plans and applicable
laws, ordinances and regulations, he shall notify the City Council of
such fact, and the City may, thereupon, take such action as it shall
deem appropriate to compel performance or may, in the
alternative, declare a forfeiture of the performance guaranty, and
the obligor and surety shall thereupon be liable upon the
performance guaranty to the City for the reasonable cost of the
improvements, facilities and work not completed or corrected, and
the City may, either prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds of
the performance guaranty, complete or correct such improvements,
facilities or work by the employment of such City personnel or
private contractor as it shall deem appropriate.
§ 300-50 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-50
285:938
(3) Completion and final inspection.
(a) When all of the required improvements, facilities and work
within a stage or unit of the development have been completed,
the obligor shall send written notice of such completion to the
City Council by certified mail, addressed in care of the City
Clerk. A copy of such notification shall also be sent to the City
Engineer.
(b) Upon receipt of such notice, the City Engineer shall inspect all
of the improvements, facilities and work and shall, within 45
days from receipt of the notice from the obligor, file a detailed
written report with the City Council, indicating either
approval, partial approval or rejection of the improvements
and facilities, with detailed reasons in support of any rejection.
In case part of the improvements, facilities or work is approved
and part rejected, the report of the City Engineer shall set
forth the cost of the improvements, facilities and work required
for acceptance of the rejected improvements, facilities and
work. The City Engineer shall simultaneously send a copy of
such report to the obligor.
(4) Action by City Council.
(a) Within 45 days from receipt of the report of the City Engineer,
the City Council shall, by resolution, either approve, partially
approve or reject the improvements, facilities and work on the
basis of said report and shall, within such 45 days, notify the
obligor, in writing, by certified mail, of the contents of said
report and the action of the City Council with relation thereto.
A copy of such notification shall also be sent by City Council to
the surety. Failure of City Council to send or provide such
notification to the obligor within such 45 days shall be deemed
to constitute approval of the improvement, facility or work
which was the subject of the obligor's original notice.
(b) Upon such approval or the expiration of such a period of time
without action, the obligor and surety shall be released from all
liability pursuant to the performance guaranty. Where partial
approval is granted, the obligor and surety shall be released
from all liability pursuant to the performance guaranty as to
the improvements, facilities and work approved, but shall not
be released as to any improvements, facilities or work rejected.
(c) If all or any portion of the required improvements, facilities or
work is rejected, the City Council shall require the obligor to
complete such improvements, facilities and work and to again
give notice of such completion pursuant to this section within a
period of time to be fixed by the City Council. In the
alternative, if any required improvements, facilities or work
are not completed or not corrected in accordance with the
§ 300-50 WATER § 300-50
285:939
approved final plan, decision and resolution and applicable
laws, ordinances and regulations, the City may declare a
forfeiture of the performance guaranty, and, thereupon, the
obligor and surety shall be liable upon the performance
guaranty to the City for the reasonable cost of the
improvements, facilities or work not completed or corrected,
and the City may, either prior to or after the receipt of the
proceeds of the performance guaranty, complete or correct
such improvements or facilities by the employment of such City
personnel or private contractors as it shall deem appropriate.
E. Building and other permits. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
§ 300-36G(2)(j), upon, but not before, receiving notice from the Zoning
Officer that the approved final plan or plat has been recorded and upon
application by the applicant, all appropriate officials of the City may
issue building and other permits to an applicant for development,
construction and other work in the areas encompassed by the approved
final plan or plat; provided, however, that no such permit shall be issued
unless the appropriate official is first satisfied that the requirements of
any codes or ordinances of the City, in addition to this chapter, which
are applicable to the permit sought have been satisfied. No certificate
of occupancy shall be issued for any use or structure within such area
until all improvements, facilities and work required to be guaranteed
pursuant to § 300-49 hereof have been completed and accepted as
therein provided.

(a) Buildings with a maximum building height above the lower of
2 1/2 stories or 35 feet: For principle structures located on the
same lot, the minimum distance between walls containing
openings for light and air shall be equal to 33% of the height of
the tallest structure, but not less than the rear yard
requirement applicable to the structure without expressed
written permission from the Fire Official.
(b) For all other buildings: no building or structure shall be
situated closer than 15 feet from an adjacent building or

the discretion of the Planning Board, Zoning Board of Adjustment or
Planning and Redevelopment Advisory Committee, as the case may be,
via design waiver and not variance relief pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70.
(1) Rooftop treatment.
(a) Unless otherwise specified herein, roofs shall be clad with
approved roofing materials and shall be moderately pitched
with dormers and cornices. Steeper roof pitches are
encouraged. Colored, patterned shingle designs are
encouraged.
(b) Where sloped roofs are not practicable and therefore flat roofs
are necessary, and where such roofs are less than the
maximum building height in the subject or immediately
adjacent zoning district and therefore visible from taller
buildings, whether present or prospective, including the
rooftop decks of parking structures and decks and balconies
when accessible as public open spaces, such roofs shall be
treated with decorative roofing materials in order to create an
aesthetic appearance from above. Alternatively, such rooftops
may be aesthetically developed as pedestrian-accessible
promenades, rooftop gardens and/or active or passive
recreation areas as appropriate.
(c) Where said surfaces are pedestrian accessible, a minimum of
35% of the total exposed surface area shall be landscaped as
§ 300-51 WATER § 300-51
285:949
roof gardens. Said treatment may or may not include live
vegetation.
(d) The balance of all accessible flat roof surfaces shall be treated
in such a way as to blend with the roof gardenscape in an
aesthetically acceptable manner. Said areas shall be
constructed of nonreflective material in order to secure an
agreeable visual condition.

shall be treated with nonreflective, decorative materials in
order to secure an agreeable visual condition.
(f) Pergolas, trellises or other screening above parked vehicles is
required where exposed flat roofs are used as parking decks
and for mechanical and related items.
(2) Site work.
(a) Driveways.
[1] If asphalt:
[a] New paving (residential): Minimum thickness after
rolling shall be two inches when placed upon a stable
subbase. If subbase is not stable, a base of six inches
of dense graded aggregate or recycled concrete
aggregate, installed to industry standards, is required.
[b] Overlay (resurfacing) of existing residential asphalt
driveways shall be a minimum thickness of two inches.
All surface cracks or deteriorated subbase shall be
repaired.
[2] If concrete (residential): Minimum thickness shall be four
inches when placed upon a stable subbase. If subbase is
not stable, a base of six inches of dense graded aggregate
or recycled concrete aggregate, installed to industry
standards, is required.
[3] Nonresidential: Nonresidential driveways shall utilize the
requirements of this subsection as a minimum. Specific
details shall be evaluated by the City or Board Engineer on
a case-by-case basis in light of the type and weight of
vehicles, frequency of crossing and other pertinent
requirements of the subject use.
(b) Sidewalks: shall be Class "B" concrete, with a minimum
thickness of four inches when placed upon a stable subbase. If
subbase is not stable, a base of four inches to six inches of

conditions and determining appropriate treatment prior to
commencement of work.
(d) Landscaping shall be in accordance with § 300-65 through
§ 300-70.
(e) Fencing and walls shall be in accordance with § 300-71.
(3) Treatment of structural surfaces. Structural surfaces shall
generally be treated with nonreflective materials. Where reflective
materials are utilized, the reflective surface shall not cause an
adverse impact on surrounding uses, such as increasing the cooling
loads of the structures upon which they reflect heat (and thereby
causing visual discomfort or related effects).
(4) Exterior building architecture (Note: Form, materials, color,
massing and detailing elements for building facades, windows,
awnings, lighting, signage, etc.) shall coordinate design elements
to achieve design harmony and continuity for all building
elevations, both within a single structure and between separate
structures.
(5) The entirety of all building elevations fronting a public right-of-way,
regardless of building height, shall be considered a front yard and
primary elevation, with facades and appurtenances treated
accordingly.
(6) In order to create an attractive and inviting pedestrian-scaled
environment, the entire first floor of a building's right-of-way
frontage, with the exception of ground-floor garage entryways and
exitways, shall be of a pedestrian scale and shall be devoted to
active permitted principal or conditional uses, oriented to the rightof-
way frontage, or shall be designed as a decorative streetscape
with such treatment and features as may be required to provide a
sense of excitement and vibrancy and to avoid an otherwise lifeless
facade.
(a) Nonresidential and nonindustrial uses shall incorporate clear
storefront glass to display the nature of the use within and
produce an interesting pedestrian streetscape.
(b) In considering facade treatment, developers are encouraged to
include a combination of rich detailing, texture, shadow lines
and color.
(c) Regardless of location, such treatment for nonresidential
development may include, but need not be limited to:
[1] Awnings and canopies.
[2] Coping, fascia, soffits and architectural filigree.
§ 300-51 WATER § 300-51
285:951
[3] Use of color, light and shadows.
[4] Building articulation.
[5] Signage.
[6] Other appropriate aesthetic features.
(7) In addition to such facade treatment, development shall include
decorative streetscaping consisting of, but not limited to,
landscaping and hardscaping, benches and other street furniture,
decorative lighting (both pedestrian and architectural), statuary
and other public art, and like and similar features which achieve
the stated goal both during the day and nighttime hours, for the full
12 months of the year.
(8) Each individual use shall have its own entryway, which shall be
independent from the host structure such that patrons may access
such use without entering the larger structure. Such uses may
additionally have access from the structure if desired. The
frontages of such uses may either have identical designs to
reinforce the building architecture or varied designs to express the
individuality of the uses.
(9) Windows may be either typical commercial (large, single pane) or
may be or provide the appearance of being double-hung traditional
design (Note: multiple small panes separated by mullions. Such
windows need not operate as traditional double hung windows.) at
regular placement, including the side and rear elevations if visible
from the public right-of-way. Bay, box and/or ornamental windows
are permitted to maximize building aesthetics.
(10) Excessive runs of blank, unarticulated or unadorned exterior walls,
defined as exterior walls with an uninterrupted horizontal run
along a single plane of more than 50 l.f. and an uninterrupted
vertical run of more than 24 l.f. shall be avoided, both at the
pedestrian level and above. The intent of this regulation may be
achieved via structural or ornamental treatment, including, but not
limited to, combinations of horizontal and vertical building and
roofline articulation, facade differentiation, generous use of doors
and windows (faux or real), architectural detailing and
ornamentation, and shall be employed to create an attractive and
exciting design on all building facades.
(11)With the exception for residential sunrooms and greenhouses:
(a) Structural surfaces should be treated with nonreflective
materials. Where reflective material are utilized, the reflective
surface shall not cause an adverse impact on surrounding uses,
such as increasing the cooling loads of the structures upon
which they reflect heat (and thereby causing visual discomfort
or related effects).
§ 300-51 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-51
285:952
(b) Glass, metal or non-natural-looking material shall be limited to
architectural elements or accent features in order to provide
interest to the structure while maintaining an aesthetic
appearance.
(c) The use of glass curtain wall construction is prohibited.
(12) Mechanical equipment and similar back-of-the-house functions,
whether at grade or on the structure's roof, shall be appropriately
screened so as to not be visible from the public right-of-way or an
adjacent property.
(13) To the extent practicable, primary ingress and egress to the site
shall be from a single curb cut along the front lot line, with
additional egress points located at the side or rear lot lines.
(14) All vehicular ingress and egress points shall be clearly demarcated
and controlled to ensure safe and efficient operation of the facility
and to assure safe integration of automotive traffic with other
vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
(15) Adequate lighting shall be provided for all parking, loading and
vehicular and pedestrian circulation areas.
(16) Exterior building and site lighting shall be designed so that lighting
is focused downward and shall be shielded or deflected away from
adjacent land uses so that it does not create a glare upon adjacent
land uses or public rights-of-way and does not obstruct or deter the
visibility of drivers or pedestrians on or near the site. Such lighting
shall provide for a minimum of 0.5 footcandle.
(17) Light standards shall be of an ornamental design and shall not
exceed the lower of the height of the building the lighting is
intended to service or 30 feet (measured from finished grade),
except for the RSC Zoning District, wherein height shall not exceed
50 feet (measured from finished grade).
(18) Except as otherwise provided under § 300-57 through § 300-64,
blinking or flashing lighting systems are prohibited.
(19) Exposed chimneys shall be clad with brick, organic or
manufactured stone, stucco or other appropriate material.
(20) Colors shall be neutral, earthtone or traditional palates in order to
provide a visual harmony with the surrounding natural or manmade
environment. More vibrant colors may be used for accent
purposes.
(21) While buildings may functionally have entrances on the side, rear
or interior of the project, all buildings shall be designed to give the
appearance that their primary (front) elevation faces the building's
right-of-way frontage.
§ 300-51 WATER § 300-51
285:953
(22) The incorporation of awning and similar elements is encouraged.
(23) While buildings may be constructed on pilings, exterior foundation
walls shall surround all buildings from grade to start of the siding
material. Foundation walls, whether structural or not, shall be
treated with latticework; brickwork; stucco or stucco-like material;
organic or manufactured stone; split-faced block; or other
appropriate materials to a height of two feet from finished grade;
the intent being to prohibit bare, unsightly block at the foundation.
Above two feet, foundations shall be finished with the same
materials and in the same architectural fashion as the balance of
the subject elevation.
(24) The use of dramatic corporate icons, architectural brand theming
and outdoor theatrical lighting is encouraged at the upper levels of
commercial structures or vertical (residential) development.
(25) Buildings with a maximum building height above the lower of 2 1/2
stories or 35 feet:
(a) With the exception of access drives, a minimum ten-foot-wide
landscaped buffer shall be provided along all lot lines. Along
the front lot line (Note: See definitions of "lot, corner," "lot
depth," "lot frontage, primary," "lot frontage, secondary" and
"lot line, front" for measurements related to corner lots.), such
landscaping shall primarily consist of low-growing shrubs,
flowering plants and similar vegetation, but may include
deciduous trees if not located within any sight triangle
required by § 300-47B. A more intense vegetative buffer,
consisting of coniferous trees (at a minimum of 10 feet in
height at time of planting and planted in double alternating
rows), taller shrubs, berms and other appropriate elements,
shall be required along the side and rear lot lines.
(b) All building elevations above grade level shall present the
illusion of an active residential use (if such actual use is not
practicable) or shall be heavily treated with architectural or
ornamental elements so as to avoid a monolithic facade both
during the day and nighttime hours, for the full 12 months of
the year.
(c) It is the City's intention not to permit traditional, open parking
decks wherein parked vehicles are visible to the public.
Window-like cutouts and/or other architectural elements are

by establishing minimum requirements for the off-street parking and
loading of motor vehicles in accordance with the use to which a
property is put.
B. The duty to provide and maintain off-street parking and loading spaces
shall be the joint and several responsibilities of the owner, operator and
lessee of the use for which such spaces are required.
C. Where the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case
may be, grants variance relief from these parking or loading
requirements, an approved parking plan or delivery plan, as
appropriate, including but not limited to hours of operations and
staging for deliveries, shall be made part and parcel of such grant of
variance relief.
D. Applicability.
(1) Except as otherwise provided under Subsection D(2), (3) and (4),
the provisions of this subsection shall apply to all new and existing

required herein.
(2) Whenever a use existing on the effective date of this chapter is
changed to a new use, off-street parking and loading shall be
provided as required herein for such new use; except that when any
such existing use was deficient in required off-street parking or
loading spaces on such effective date, such new use may be
established with a deficiency in required parking or loading spaces
equal in number to the preexisting deficiency, provided that such
new use does not increase the demand for parking or loading on
the premises.
(3) Whenever the intensity of the use of any building, structure or use
is increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor
area, seating capacity or other units of measurement specified
herein for required off-street parking and loading, off-street
parking and loading as required herein shall be provided for such
increase in intensity; provided, however, that no building, structure
or use lawfully existing on the effective date of this chapter shall be
required to provide any additional parking or loading facilities
pursuant to this subsection unless and until the aggregate increase
in intensity shall equal more than 10% of the intensity existing
upon such effective date, in which case off-street parking and

permitted principal uses.
C. Computation of required spaces.
(1) Off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with the
following Schedule of Required Off-Street Parking Spaces.
(2) Should the computation of the number of required off-street
parking spaces result in a fraction of a space, any fraction up to and
including 1/2 shall be disregarded (i.e., rounded down), and any
fraction over 1/2 shall require one parking space (i.e., rounded up).
D. Schedule of Required Off-Street Parking Spaces. [Amended
3-19-2018 by Ord. No. 2-2018]

(2) When parking spaces are required on the basis of the number of
faculty, staff, students or employees, the maximum number of
personnel present at any one time shall govern.
(3) Where a use is not expressly listed in the Schedule of Off-Street
Parking Spaces, parking spaces shall be provided on the same basis
as required for the most similar use listed, or as determined by the
Zoning Officer, Planning Board or Zoning Board, as the case may
be, pursuant to their authority to interpret the provisions of this
chapter. In making such determination, the Zoning Officer,
Planning Board or Zoning Board, as the case may be, may look to
the parking requirements for the use in question or for similar uses
in neighboring municipalities for guidance.
(4) Reduction in parking requirements. In locations within 300 feet of
an established public transit route, the parking requirements
established herein may, if approved by the Planning Board or
Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be at the time of site

ARTICLE XII
Signage
§ 300-57. Purpose and intent.
A. The regulation of signs under this chapter is intended to promote and
protect the public health, safety and welfare and support economic
development in the City of Pleasantville by:
(1) Minimizing the adverse effects of signage on public and private
property, thereby enhancing and protecting the aesthetic
environment in the City by minimizing excess or undue signage
what has come to be known as sign pollution.
(2) Reducing the depreciation of property values caused by signs
which are incompatible with surrounding land uses.
(3) Creating a more attractive residential and economic climate within
the City and thereby maintain and enhance the City's ability to
retain existing businesses and attract new commercial operators.
(4) Reducing distractions, obstructions and hazards caused by the
indiscriminate placement and use of signs.
(5) Encouraging the effective use of signage as a means of
communication.
(6) Enabling the fair and consistent enforcement of signage
regulations.
B. Scope.
(1) The regulations of this section shall govern and control the
erection, enlargement, expansion, alteration, operation,
maintenance, relocation and removal of signs within the City of
Pleasantville which are visible from any street, road, sidewalk,
public or private property.
(2) The regulations of this section relate to the location of signs, by
function and type, within the City's various zoning districts, and
shall be in addition to provisions of the International Building Code
and the National Electrical Code applicable to the construction and
maintenance of signs.
(3) Any sign not expressly permitted by these regulations shall be
prohibited.
C. Zoning permit required.
(1) Except as expressly provided in § 300-61, no sign shall be erected,
enlarged, expanded, altered or relocated unless a zoning permit
evidencing compliance of such work with the provisions of this
section and other applicable provisions of this chapter shall have
§ 300-57 WATER § 300-57

first been issued; provided, however, that routine sign
maintenance, changing of parts designed to be changed or
changing the content of a sign in any manner which does not
change the functional classification of the sign shall not, in and of
itself, be considered an alteration of the sign requiring the issuance
of a zoning permit.
(2) In addition to the information and documents required by
§ 300-34A and Checklist B, every application for a zoning permit for
a sign shall be accompanied by:
(a) A copy of the plans and specifications for the propose sign,

ARTICLE XIII
Landscaping, Fences and Walls
§ 300-65. Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to provide regulations for the landscaping
of the various parcels and open spaces within the City of Pleasantville in
order to prevent soil erosion; enhance aesthetics; reduce air, sound and
light pollution; control winds and to provide visual barrier as appropriate.
§ 300-66. Landscape plan.
A. With the exception of exempt development pursuant to § 300-10, each
application for new development, as well as exterior renovations to
existing development shall include a comprehensive landscape plan,
addressing the entire development and integrating the various
elements of site design, topography, parking and buffering
requirements of this chapter in order to preserve and enhance the
natural character of the lot where such character exists, or to create a
pleasing visual environment where such character does not exist.
B. Landscape plans shall be approved by the Planning Board or Zoning
Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, as part of the site plan/
subdivision approval process.
C. With the exception of exempt development pursuant to § 300-10,
landscape plans attendant to all other applications may be prepared by
the applicant, his/her professional planner or professional engineer, or
a horticulturist or landscaper.
D. Landscape plans shall describe, in graphic and, as appropriate,
schedule form:
(1) The location, quantity, common name, botanical (scientific) name,
size and installation details for each species, including size and
spacing at initial planting (either by caliper or width and height);
(2) Information as to how the plants will be grown and moved (e.g.,
nursery grown, moved by ball and burlap, bare roots or
containerized, etc.);
(3) The type of ground cover and mulches proposed;
(4) Fence types and height;
(5) The height, width, slope and planting cover of all berms;
(6) The type of construction materials used in landscaping (e.g.,
railroad ties, stone, paver, etc);
(7) The sod/grass seed mixture, and, as applicable, rate of application;
§ 300-65 WATER § 300-66
285:1015
§ 300-67. General requirements.
(8) Typical tree/shrub planting details, addressing existing and
finished grades, typical saucer berm graphic, area and depth of
mulch, directions for pruning, depth and width of pit, location and
type of staking, type of topsoil mixture and wrapping details for
deciduous trees; and
(9) When existing natural growth is proposed to remain, the applicant
shall include the proposed methods to protect existing elements
both during and after construction.
E. For the purposes of clarity, the landscape plan shall be an independent
sheet and not combined with other required submission items (i.e., a
combined "Landscape and Grading Plan").
F. Recognizing that landscaping involves biological life forms that
constantly evolve to changing environments, the regulations of this
chapter may be modified or waived at the request of an applicant,
provided that such waiver request is supported by evidence or
testimony from a qualified landscape professional, such as a
horticulturist or landscape architect.
A. Topsoil preservation. Topsoil moved during the course of construction
shall be, to the extent practicable, cleaned to be free of roots, branches,
stumps and other tree parts, litter, stones, leaves, weeds, brush, excess
or scrap building materials and other debris, and then redistributed on
all regraded surfaces so as to provide at least four inches of even cover
to all nondeveloped areas of the site, and shall be stabilized by seeding
or planting.
B. New topsoil. Where four inches of topsoil cannot be achieved by the
redistribution/regarding of existing soils pursuant to § 300-67A, new,
clean topsoil shall be added to provide for the minimum four inches
coverage.
C. Removal of debris. All stumps, tree parts, litter, brush, weeds, excess or
scrap building materials or other debris shall be removed from the site
and disposed in accordance with applicable law. No tree stumps,
portions of tree trunks or limbs shall be buried anywhere on site. All
dead or dying trees, standing or fallen, shall be removed from the site
and properly disposed of. Subject to approval of the City Engineer, trees
and limbs may be reduced to chips and used as mulch in landscaped
areas.
D. Protection of existing plantings. Maximum effort shall be made to save
specimen elements, as defined in § 300-10. No material or temporary
soil deposits shall be placed within four feet of shrubs or 10 feet of trees
designated to be retained and so designated on the preliminary and/or
final landscape plan. Protective barriers of tree wells shall be installed
around each plant and/or group of plants that are to remain on the site.
§ 300-66 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-67
285:1016
§ 300-68. Planting specifications.
Barriers shall not be supported by the plants they are protecting, but
shall be self-supporting, shall be a minimum of four feet high and shall
be constructed of a durable material that will last until construction
is completed. Snow fences and slit fences are examples of acceptable
barriers.
A. Natural topography and vegetation shall be employed where possible.
The species utilized shall be appropriate for the site, considering soil
and wind conditions, slope, use of the site and purpose of the plantings.
B. Deciduous trees shall have at least a 2 1/2 inches' caliper at planting,
measured 12 inches above the ground, with a minimum standing height
of 10 feet.
C. Sizes of evergreens trees and shrubs may vary depending on setting,
species and proposed use.
(1) Evergreen tress shall be no less than seven feet to eight feet in
height at time of planting.
(2) Unless specifically a dwarf variety, shrubs shall be no less than 24
inches to 30 inches at time of planting, except for shrubs used for
buffer screening, which shall be 30 inches to 36 inches.
D. Trees shall be nursery grown, of substantially uniform size and shape
with straight trunks (although ornamental trees need not have straight
trunks, but must conform in other respects with the provisions for trees
and tree plantings outlined herein). All trees shall be brought to the site
balled and burlapped, or other acceptable means, free from insects and
disease and true to species and variety.
E. Trees, shrubs and ground cover shall be properly planted in accordance
with accepted horticultural standards, shall be properly staked until
established, and provision shall be made by the applicant for regular
watering and maintenance until established.
(1) Staking.
(a) Stakes are to be driven outside the root ball.
(b) Stakes shall be hardwood. A minimum of two stakes shall be
used per tree.
(c) Stakes shall be a minimum of two inches in diameter at the
thick end.
(d) Stakes, when driven, must be 1/2 to 2/3 the height of the tree,
measured from ground level.
(e) Stakes shall be attached to the tree with twelve-gauge
galvanized wire covered with rubber or plastic hose where
§ 300-67 WATER § 300-68
285:1017
wire is likely to come in contact with the tree trunk. An
alternative may be any of the commercially available materials
designed for staking trees as approved by the Zoning Officer,
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case
may be. The loop in contact with the tree shall be loose enough
to permit growth and prevent girding for two years but shall
be tightly bound to the stake to prevent slipping.
(f) Stakes shall remain in place at least two years and shall be
removed at that time.
(2) Wrapping.
(a) Deciduous trees shall be wrapped with an expandable paper or
cloth treated to last at least one year.
(b) The wrap shall extend from the ground level to the first
branches.
(c) To prevent scald, the wrap shall be attached or fastened at
each end with a material that will permit growth without
girding.
(3) Saucers.
(a) A ring of packed soil shall be placed around the finished
planting hole of each tree.
(b) The saucer shall be a minimum of six inches higher than the
finished grade.
(c) Saucers placed on slopes shall be level at the top end and
perpendicular to the tree trunk.
(d) Saucers are to be designed to catch and hold the maximum
amount of water either from natural precipitation or irrigation.
(4) Mulching.
(a) A two-inch minimum layer of mulch shall be applied around
each individual tree or shrub or group of trees or shrubs.
(b) Partially rotted or nitrogen-enriched wood chips may be used
(new chips are not acceptable as their natural bacteria draws
nitrogen from the soil, thus limiting the nitrogen available to
the plants).
(5) Tree pits and shrub pits shall be six inches deeper and at least 12
inches wider than the ball of the plant.
(6) Planting. Plants shall be set straight and firmly tamped, and then
adequately watered, guyed, pruned and wrapped.
§ 300-68 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-68
285:1018
§ 300-69. Plant species and functions.
(7) Backfill mixture. The types of backfill mixture shall consist of 2/3
topsoil and 1/3 peat, or other materials as required by specific
plants.
F. Dead or dying plants, including those which have been transplanted in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter, shall be replaced
during the next recommended planting season.
G. All landscape plans shall contain the following note: "All plant material
not surviving for a period of two years shall be replaced with the same
or equivalent size species."
H. With the exception of single-family detached dwellings, all landscaped
areas shall be irrigated by an automatic/mechanical irrigation system.
I. Wherever possible, landscaping shall promote creativity in design,
locations and species. For example, instead of planting trees in straight
rows, the applicant might group trees into clusters with different
combinations of species in each cluster.
A. General requirements.
(1) Plant species should be hardy for Climatic Zone 7 and appropriate
in terms of function and size.
(2) Plant selection shall be varied to avoid monoculture, with species
selected for their ability to survive in an urban environment.
Species shall be salt tolerant if to be located in proximity to Lakes
Bay or Absecon Bay.
(3) Tree species may vary depending on overall effect desired.
However, as a general rule, all street trees on a particular right-ofway
shall be the same species, except where otherwise desired to
achieve a special effect (as approved by the Zoning Officer,
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may
be). Species selection shall be approved as part of the landscape
plan.
B. Street trees.
(1) Only deciduous trees shall be used as street trees.
(2) Street trees shall be installed in accordance with the approved
landscape plan. The trees shall be installed between the curbline
and the sidewalk when a grass area of at least one foot in width is
provided. If the distance between the curb and sidewalk is less than
one foot, the street trees shall be installed five feet behind the
sidewalk. Trees may be massed at critical points or spaced evenly
along the street, or both.
(3) Street tree spacing.
§ 300-68 WATER § 300-69
285:1019
(a) When street trees are planted at intervals along streets,
spacing shall depend on tree size as follows:
Tree Size
Planting Interval
(feet on center)
Trees 40 feet in height or taller at
maturity
40 to 50
Trees 30 feet to 40 feet in height
at maturity
35 to 40
Trees less than 30 feet in height
at maturity
25 to 35
(b) When the spacing interval exceeds 40 feet, small ornamental
trees may be spaced between the larger trees. If a street
canopy effect is desired, trees may be planted closer together,
following the recommendation of a New Jersey Licensed
landscape architect. The trees shall be planted so as not to
interfere with utilities, roadways, sidewalks, sight easements,
sight triangles or streetlights. Tree location, landscaping
design and spacing shall be approved by the Zoning Officer,
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case
may be, as the case may be, as part of the landscape plan.
(4) At intersections, trees shall not be located closer than 30 feet from
the intersection of the street right-of-way lines, and may be further
where the standards of § 300-47B increase the distance for sight
triangles.
(5) The landscape plan for street trees shall include a graphic treeplanting
detail which shall address the following:
(a) Thinning of branches and foliage by 1/3. The leader shall not
be cut;
(b) Staking and supporting in accordance with § 300-68E(1);
(c) The trunk shall be protected by tree wrap;
(d) Trees shall be mulched with three inches of approved organic
material;
(e) A three-inch saucer shall be constructed around the planting
area;
(f) The top of the burlap shall be untied and removed;
(g) The ball shall rest on compacted soil; and
(h) The diameter of the hole shall be two feet larger than the
diameter of the ball.

NOTES:
* Denotes potential trees to plant under overhead wires.
E. Buffer areas.
(1) Buffer areas shall be developed in an aesthetic manner for the
primary purpose of providing year-round visual screening and
noise reduction in order to minimize adverse impacts from a site on
an adjacent property or from adjacent areas, and may consist of a
combination of fencing; evergreen trees, shrubbery or hedges;
berms; rocks/boulders; decorative masonry; or other elements to
achieve the stated objectives.
(2) Buffer areas shall be planted and maintained with either grass or
ground cover together with a screen of live shrubs or scattered
planting of live trees, shrubs or other plant materials. The
preservation of natural wooded areas shall be an integral part of all
development plans, and natural wooded areas located along a site
boundary shall be integrated into the required buffer area,
provided that the growth is of a density and width sufficient for
buffering purposes. Additional plantings may be required by the
Zoning Officer, Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as
the case may be, to establish an appropriate tone for an effective
buffer.
(3) Buffering shall be required when topographical or other barriers do
not provide reasonable screening and when the Zoning Officer,
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be,
determines that there is a need to shield the site from adjacent
properties in order to minimize adverse impacts, such as
incompatible land uses, noise, glaring light and traffic. For
example, but without limitation, a board may require landscaping,
fences or walls to ensure privacy and screen dwelling units in
small-lot developments when site and building design do not
provide adequate privacy.
(4) Buffer widths shall be measured horizontally and perpendicular to
lot and street lines.
(5) The location and design of buffer areas are intended to provide
flexibility in providing effective screening. The following shall be
considered in designing buffer areas:
(a) The use of the portion of the property being screened;
(b) The distance between the use and the adjoining property line;
(c) The difference in elevations;
(d) The type of buffer (i.e., dense planting, existing woods, walls or
fences);
§ 300-69 WATER § 300-69
285:1025
(e) Buffer height and width; and
(f) Other combinations of man-made and natural features.
(6) The buffer shall be designed, planted, graded, landscaped and
developed with the general guideline that the closer a use or
activity is to a property line, or the more intense the use, the more
effective the buffer area must be in obscuring light and vision and
reducing noise beyond the site.
(7) Buffer areas and landscape screens shall consist predominately of
evergreen species having a minimum height of five feet above the
ground when planted. Such evergreens shall be placed five feet o.c.
in two or more staggered rows with a five feet separation between
rows. The selected trees shall be thickly branched and dense,
especially close to the ground, and shall have a fast growth rate in
the early years. Evergreens may be supplemented with deciduous
and flowering trees having a minimum 10 feet height at time of
planting with a minimum caliper of two inches.
(8) No structure, activity, storage of materials or parking of vehicles
shall be permitted in a buffer area.
(9) Except as otherwise provided for herein, buffers shall be a
minimum of 15 feet wide and shall be designed, planted, graded
and landscaped to provide an aesthetically pleasing separation of
uses.
(10) Where required, buffers shall be measured from side and rear
properly lines, excluding access driveways.
(11) If, in the judgment of the Zoning Officer, Planning Board or Zoning
Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, the buffer area depicted
on the landscape plan will not adequately screen the site as
required by this section, the landscape plan shall be modified to
increase, enhance and/or redesign the buffer to achieve the desired
effect.
(12) Where residential development abuts higher-order streets
(collectors or arterials), units should front on internal streets with
landscape buffers from the collector and arterial roads as
applicable.
(13) Buffer plantings shall be broken at points of vehicular and
pedestrian ingress and egress to assure a clear sight triangle at all
street and driveway intersections.
(14)Off-street parking areas, loading areas and driveways. Except for
single-family detached and two-family dwelling units:
(a) Off-street parking areas, garbage/recycling collection areas,
utility areas and loading/unloading areas shall be screened
around their perimeter by a minimum five-foot-wide buffer
§ 300-69 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-69
285:1026
consisting of screen plantings, berms, fences, walls, or
combinations thereof, not less than four feet in height between
the subject area and any lot line or street line, except where a
building serves as the buffer between the parking area and the
lot line or street line.
(b) All loading areas shall be landscaped and screened sufficiently
to obscure the view of the parked vehicles and loading
platforms from any public street, adjacent property or
residential zoning district for the full 12 months of the year.
Such screening shall be made via an extension of the building,
fence, berm, wall or planting, or combination thereof, and shall
not be less than four feet in height.
(c) Each off-street parking area shall reserve a minimum 5% of its
land area for landscaped islands, distributed throughout the
parking area in order to break the view of parked cars in a
manner not impairing visibility.
(d) Parking areas located in front of buildings shall be generously
landscaped to separate them from adjacent sidewalks and/or
roadways.
(e) One shade tree, measuring a minimum of 2 1/2 inches caliper
at planting, shall be provided for every three parking spaces.
Trees shall be staggered or spaced so as not to interfere with
driver vision, and have branches no lower than six feet from
grade.
(f) Areas adjacent to driveways shall be planted with low-lying
plants or grass.
(15) The following trees are prohibited in all buffer areas.
Latin Name Common Name
Abies pinsapo Spanish Fir
Araucaria araucana Monkey Puzzle
Araucaria heterophylla Norfolk Island Pine
Cedrus atlantica Atlas Cedar

F. Additional landscaping: in addition to the street tree and buffer area
requirements of § 300-69B and E:
(1) For residential development, additional landscaping elements shall
be required where necessary for climate control, privacy or
aesthetic purposes.
(2) For nonresidential development, all areas not occupied by
buildings and required improvements shall be landscaped by the
planting of grass or other ground cover, shrubs and trees.
(3) Regional Shopping Center (RSC) Zoning District:
(a) In addition to landscape requirements of § 300-65 through
§ 300-70, a minimum twenty-five-foot landscaped buffer zone
shall be required from all lands owned by the City of
Pleasantville or the South Jersey Transportation Authority.
(b) All areas not covered by buildings, sidewalks or paving shall be
landscaped.
(c) A planted area, no less than 25 feet in width at primary street
frontage, 10 feet at rear yard and no less than five feet wide at
side yards, composed of lawn, shrubbery, trees, decorative
crushed rock, gravel or bark, shall be placed and continuously
maintained in a proper and attractive manner exclusive of
driveway and access openings.
(d) The integrity of all landscaped plantings and buffer areas shall
be protected by adequate maintenance and necessary
replacement of plant materials. Plant material shall be
sufficiently hardy to withstand the rigors of weather, vehicle
emission, wind blast, heat, glare, cold and other physical
conditions common to this section of the City. All materials
shall be adequately protected from damage resulting from
traffic movement, pedestrian circulation or other physical
conditions by designed curbing, fencing, dry wells, vent tiles,
grasses and similar protective measures.
(e) Adequate screening, composed of masonry walls or fencing of
an approved design, dense plantings of evergreen shrubs or
trees, berms, depression of visible portions of the site below
§ 300-69 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-69
285:1028
§ 300-70. Tree protection and replacement.
the grade, or similar measures, shall be carried out to ensure
that loading areas will not be visible from any adjoining
property.
(4) Light Industrial (LI) Zoning District. All uses in the Light Industrial
Zoning District shall be screened from view from any public rightof-
way or adjacent property by a fence or wall, as well as by an
appropriate combination of plant material in order to soften the
appearance of said fence or wall. The adequacy and acceptability of
the landscaping plan shall be determined by the approving Board.
A. Purpose.
(1) The purpose of this section is to establish protective regulations for
trees within the City of Pleasantville in order to assist in the control
of flooding, soil erosion, air pollution and noise pollution; protect
the public health, safety and welfare of citizens; and promote
quality development in the City and to encourage the protection of
the greatest number of trees in general, and of specimen trees in
particular, throughout the City.
(2) Every attempt shall be made by applicants to save existing trees,
even at the loss of parking spaces. Groupings of trees should be
saved over single trees.
(3) Recognizing that wild trees often do not survive when their habitat
is drastically altered, care should be taken by the Zoning Officer,
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be,
to properly evaluate site clearing proposals. Where loss of trees is
proposed, a compensatory planting plan is required.
B. Tree protection plan. A tree protection plan shall be required as part of
the landscape plan where one or more live trees are proposed to be cut
or removed from the site during development. Such plan shall be
submitted at time of application and shall contain the following
information:
(1) The location of all buildings, driveways, grading, septic fields,
easements, underground utility lines, rights-of-way and other
existing or proposed improvements.
(2) The location of existing natural features, including wooded areas,
watercourses, wetlands and floodplains.
(3) The limits of the proposed tree protection zone.
(4) The location of all existing live trees with trunk diameters eight
inches or greater, measured 4 1/2 feet above ground level. Each
such tree shall be noted by its species, size and general health
condition.
§ 300-69 WATER § 300-70
285:1029
(a) Whenever possible, the actual canopy spread shall be shown. If
it must be estimated, the canopy shall equal 1 1/2 feet of
diameter per one inch of trunk diameter.
(b) Where the density of forestation makes identification of
individual trees impracticable, only the outermost individuals/
canopy line need be shown, unless disturbance is proposed,
then individual trees located within 50 feet of the proposed
edge of the woodland shall be shown.
(5) A clear indication of each tree (or groups of trees) to be removed or
transplanted.
(6) A chart depicting each tree proposed for removal, indicating their
diameters and replacements pursuant to the compensatory tree
schedule as required by the compensatory planting plan detailed in
§ 300-70D.
(7) Specifications for the removal of existing trees and the protection
in place of existing trees where they are to be preserved, including
detail(s) of the Tree-protection fencing.
C. The stripping of trees or filling more than six inches around trees shall
not be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that construction
requirements necessitate these actions, in which case the lots shall be
replanted with trees to reestablish the tone of the area and to conform
to adjacent lots in accordance with the compensatory planting schedule
detailed in § 300-70D.
D. Compensatory planting plan. In the event that preservation of existing
trees within the tree protection zone is not practicable, and where a
redesign of the project or relocation of improvements is not possible, a
compensatory planting plan shall be required to replace each live tree
proposed to be removed from the tree protection zone and each
specimen tree proposed to be removed anywhere from the site. The
compensatory planting plan shall include the following:
(1) Compensatory trees shall be provided in the following ratios,
applicable to both dciduous and evergreen trees.
(a) For trees eight inches to 17 inches in diameter, one new tree
shall be provided for every one existing tree cut or removed.
(b) For trees 18 inches to 30 inches in diameter, two new trees
shall be provided for every one existing tree cut or removed.
(c) For trees 31 inches in diameter or greater, three new trees
shall be provided for every one existing tree cut or removed.
(d) One street tree shall be replanted in the street tree planting
strip for each existing street tree cut or removed.
§ 300-70 PLEASANTVILLE CODE § 300-70
285:1030
(2) In evaluating existing trees for compensatory planting, trunk
diameters shall be measured according to the following guidelines:
(a) Single-trunked shade trees shall be measured at a point 4 1/2
feet above ground level at the location of the tree.
(b) Single-trunked ornamental trees shall be measured at a point
12 inches above ground level at the location of the tree.
(c) Evergreen trees shall be measured at a point 12 inches above
ground level at the location of the tree.
(d) Multitrunked trees that branch between one feet and 4 1/2 feet
above ground level at the location of the tree shall be
measured at a point just below the split.
(e) Multitrunked trees that branch below one feet above ground
level at the location of the tree, the diameter shall be 60% of
the sum total of all trunks measured at a point 4 1/2 feet above
such ground level.
(3) Compensatory trees shall be three inches to 3 1/2 inches in caliper
at time of planting. Evergreen and ornamental trees may be
substituted at a ratio of two to one for every shade tree otherwise
required, for up to 50% of the requirement. Alternative types of
compensatory plantings may be permitted when approved by the
Zoning Officer, Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as
the case may be.
(4) The locations of compensatory trees must be clearly labeled on the
landscape plan. Planting locations shall be as close to the tree it
replaces as possible.
(5) The planting of compensatory trees shall be in addition to, and not
substitute for, plantings otherwise required by this chapter.
E. In the event that the applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Officer, Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the
case may be, that constraints incidental to the land itself, including,
without limitation, extreme topography, unsuitable soils, rock outcrops
and existing dense canopy, render it impractical to provide the required
number of compensatory trees, the Zoning Officer or Board may, at its
sole discretion, require/permit the applicant to:
(1) Install compensatory trees on other public lands within the City;
(2) Contribute to the City the estimated cost of those trees which
cannot practically be installed on the property for later installation
of trees on public lands; and/or
(3) Install fewer but larger or more valuable compensatory trees on
the site with an aggregate cost as installed and guaranteed not less
§ 300-70 WATER § 300-70
285:1031
§ 300-71. Fences and walls.
