case full review by the Planning Board shall be required. The Site Plan Review Committee shall

when an Overlay Zoning District overlays a Base Zoning District, or when Waterfront Protection
Overlay Zones with two different levels of waterfront protection intersect. In all cases where two
or more requirements of this Ordinance conflict, the provision that imposes the greater restriction
or higher standards shall be the controlling provision unless otherwise specified.

(D) Special Use Permits. All Open Space-Residential Cluster Developments shall obtain a
Special Use Permit from the Planning Board. The Special Use Permit shall clearly set forth all
Farmington Zoning Ordinance – adopted March 13, 2001, amended March 11, 2003; March 14, 2006; March 13, 2007; March 12, 2008; March 13, 2009; March 9,
2010; March 8, 2011; March 13, 2012; March 12, 2013, March 11, 2014, March 10, 2015, March 8, 2016; March 29, 2017; March 14, 2018; March 12, 2019 82
conditions of approval and shall clearly list all plans, drawings and other submittals that are
part of the approval. Everything shown or otherwise indicated on a plan or submittal that is
listed on the Special Use Permit shall be considered to be a condition of approval.
Construction shall not deviate from the stated conditions without approval of the modification
by the Planning Board.
The requirements of this section shall constitute the Standards and Criteria for issuance of the
Special Use Permit.
(E) Application Procedure. Applications for a Special Use Permit for an Open Space Residential
Cluster Development shall be made in accordance with the following procedures:
(1) An initial Preliminary Open Space Review shall be required with the Board prior to review
by the Technical Review Committee and prior to Subdivision Review. The purpose of
Preliminary Open Space Review shall be to determine the approximate Development Yield
for the parcel. For this hearing, the applicant shall provide to the board an Existing
Conditions Plan prepared by a licensed land surveyor. No preliminary subdivision design
is required.
(2) The applicant shall also receive site design input from the Board and estimation of the
Density Bonus Allowance from which Development Yield is determined per paragraphs (I)
through (N). The final Density Bonus Allowance can only be determined through
subsequent review of the complete plan.
(3) The applicant shall then develop the proposed plan to a point at which the plan is eligible for
technical review adhering as closely as possible to the conditions upon which the
Development Yield was determined.
(4) The application shall then begin technical review, followed by the Open Space-Residential
Cluster Development Review outlined in this section and in accordance with the other
applicable procedures adopted by the planning board.
(5) In all particulars not otherwise addressed in this ordinance, all applications shall meet those
requirements set forth in the relevant sections of the Subdivision Regulations of the
Farmington Planning Board.
(6) Where the provisions of the Subdivision regulations conflict with the provisions of this
section, the provisions of paragraph (R), “Other Regulations Applicable” shall apply.
(C) Approval of Applications. A Special Use Permit shall be approved by the Planning Board
only if an Open Space-Residential Cluster Development complies with all of the requirements
of this section and all other applicable Ordinances and Regulations of the town of Farmington.
The Planning Board may also require additional, reasonable conditions necessary to
Farmington Zoning Ordinance – adopted March 13, 2001, amended March 11, 2003; March 14, 2006; March 13, 2007; March 12, 2008; March 13, 2009; March 9,
2010; March 8, 2011; March 13, 2012; March 12, 2013, March 11, 2014, March 10, 2015, March 8, 2016; March 29, 2017; March 14, 2018; March 12, 2019 83
accomplish the objectives of this section or of the Farmington Master Plan, Zoning Ordinance,
or any other federal, state, town resolution, regulation, or law. The Special Use Permit is meant
to provide flexibility, minimize adverse impacts, and allow the Board to participate jointly with
the applicant to prepare a development that is consistent with this ordinance, regulations and
the Master Plan for the Town of Farmington.
(D) Minimum Requirements. The provisions of this section are minimum development
requirements. Each Tract of land possesses different, unique development characteristics and
limitations, and the Open Space-Residential Cluster Development use allowed on any
particular Tract will be a function of innovative land planning and subdivision design interacting
with the special characteristics and limitations of the site while remaining consistent with the
purpose and objectives of this section.
(E) Tract Frontage. The minimum Tract frontage for the development shall be a contiguous 50
feet and of sufficient length to provide safe access for a right-of-way. At least one access shall
be within the minimum Tract frontage. The minimum Tract frontage and access shall be within
the Town of Farmington.
Tract frontage may be an important viewshed component to be preserved through the
application of this ordinance. Any Tract that has had more than 50% of its frontage subdivided
away from the parent parcel after the enactment of this ordinance may apply under the Open
Space-Residential Cluster Development provisions of this section, but shall not be eligible for
any Density Bonuses normally available to Open Space- Residential Cluster Development
applications for a period of seven (7) years from the date of the subdivision approval of the
final Plat.
Baseline Density. Baseline Density shall be determined by the following Baseline Density Formula:
Formula: Example:
Total Parcel Area 100 Acres total tract size
- 26 Acres Non – Buildable Land
= 74 Acres (Buildable)
× 0.9 Roadway Factor
= 66.6 Acres Net
÷ 2 Acres (Lot size in sample
district)
= 3.33 Units (Rounded to 33 units)
Minus Non-Buildable Land (See def’n)
Equals Area Remaining
X0.9 (Subtracts 10% for roadways)
Equals Net Area
Divided By Lot Size for Zoning District
Equals Baseline Density (See Def’n)
Farmington Zoning Ordinance – adopted March 13, 2001, amended March 11, 2003; March 14, 2006; March 13, 2007; March 12, 2008; March 13, 2009; March 9,
2010; March 8, 2011; March 13, 2012; March 12, 2013, March 11, 2014, March 10, 2015, March 8, 2016; March 29, 2017; March 14, 2018; March 12, 2019 84
(I) Density Bonus. The Density Bonus shall be applied to the
number of lots achievable under the Baseline Density.
Except as noted in paragraph (H), the minimum Density
Bonus, regardless of percentage achieved, shall be one lot.
If required criteria are met, the Board may award the
development additional Density Bonuses provided in
Paragraph (N). The total Density Bonus awarded to a particular development authorized under
this section for innovative protection bonuses shall not exceed 35% of the Baseline Density.
Where a final number is .5 or greater, the Density Bonus may be rounded up to the next whole
number.
(J) Development Yield. The total yield for an Open Space-
Residential Cluster Development shall be determined by
Baseline Density plus all Density Bonuses awarded during
the final review. The Development Yield shall constitute the
approved number of residential units permitted under the
Special Use Permit. In no event shall the total
Development Yield exceed the soil-based carrying
capacity for the entire Tract.
(K) Minimum Open Space Requirements
1. At least 40% of the Open Space-Residential Cluster Development Tract shall be Open
Space permanently protected through one or more of the methods in paragraphs 3. and
4. below.
2. The Open Space shall not include land covered by structures, such as dwellings, garages,
storage sheds, patios, parking areas, driveways, street rights-of-way and aboveground
utilities. The designated Open Space shall not be used for additional building lots.
3. As a condition of approval of any subdivision Plat, the Open Space shall be permanently
protected in perpetuity and the applicant shall choose one or more of the following
methods of conveyance prior to, or simultaneous with the recording of the subdivision Plat
at the Registry of Deeds:
(a) to the Town of Farmington, under the management of the Conservation
Commission, and accepted by the Board of Selectmen for park, open space or
other specified conservation uses;
(b) to the State of New Hampshire for permanent open space uses;
(c) to a private non-profit organization which is exempt from tax under Section 501
Density Bonus Example:
If the Baseline Density calculated
with the Baseline Density Formula
equals 33 units, the maximum density
bonus allowed shall not exceed 35%
of 33 units or 11.5 units (rounded to
12 units).
Development Yield Example:
Following the example above, the
total development yield would equal
33 units (baseline density) + 12 units
(maximum allowable density bonus)
for a total of 45 units.

(A) Authority – The Town is granted authority to develop zoning ordinances to lessen
congestion in streets, secure safety from fires, panic and other dangers and facilitate the
adequate provision of transportation under RSA 674:17 (I)(a-j), and RSA 236:13(V) to
issue driveway and access permits. The Planning Board regulates subdivision of land
under RSA 674:35, and the use and site development of property adjoining highways
under RSA 674:43.
(B) Purpose – This ordinance is intended to ensure safe, efficient access to New Hampshire
Route 11 to and from non-residential or multi-family lots directly fronting on this state
highway, and to encourage smart development and economic development in Farmington.
It is in the best interests of the Town and residents to ensure planned and shared future
access to NH Route 11 in order to preserve highway capacity and public safety, while
allowing planned development of the Route 11 corridor through Farmington. Wherever
possible, shared access drives, service roads and access easements should be utilized to
implement this ordinance.
(C) Applicability – This Ordinance shall only apply to lots fronting on New Hampshire Route
11, or directly accessing New Hampshire Route 11 over the former railway Right of Way
parcel, which require Site Plan or Subdivision approval by the Planning Board. In order to
Farmington Zoning Ordinance – adopted March 13, 2001, amended March 11, 2003; March 14, 2006; March 13, 2007; March 12, 2008; March 13, 2009; March 9,
2010; March 8, 2011; March 13, 2012; March 12, 2013, March 11, 2014, March 10, 2015, March 8, 2016; March 29, 2017; March 14, 2018; March 12, 2019 103
allow for the safest, most efficient circulation of traffic and access to lots along Route 11,
the Planning Board may apply the specific provisions of this ordinance on a case by case
basis as is appropriate and to ensure safety and reasonable access, without being unduly
burdensome to the lot owner.
(D) Definitions
Access - A way or means of approach to provide physical entrance to a property.
Access Management - The systematic control of the location, spacing, design, and operation of
driveways, median openings, and street connections to a roadway, as well as roadway design
applications that affect access, such as median treatments, auxiliary lanes and appropriate
separation of traffic signals.
Cross Access Drive –An easement or service drive providing vehicular access between two or
more contiguous sites so that the driver does not need to reenter the public street system.
Driveway - A private roadway for vehicles which provides entrance, exit, access or approach to
or from land in Farmington to a public street or to abutting land.
Frontage Road – A private roadway allowing access along the front portion of adjacent
properties allowing traffic to move from one site to another without the need to re-enter
the Route 11 Corridor.
Rear Access Drive – Similar to a Frontage Road, a Rear Access Drive provides access
to adjacent parcels through the rear of lots along a private roadway, allowing traffic to
move from one site to another without the need to re-enter the Route 11 Corridor.
Shared Driveway – A driveway providing access to multiple lots along a single access
point and a single curb cut. Usually shared driveways are located on the adjoining property
line, but may be used to offer access for multiple properties over a single lot.
Traffic Impact Study – A comprehensive analysis of the “before” and “after” operational
traffic impacts to a road system and site resulting from proposed development and
associated traffic movements and volumes. Studies are used to identify capacity, safety
and circulation deficiencies and to help identify feasible solutions to these deficiencies.
Throat - The area of a driveway extending from the access point to any on-site parking or
loading area on the property. The throat is designed to store and separate queuing
ingressing and egressing vehicles making a transition between on- and off-site the
property as well as preventing safety conflicts with on-site and off-site traffic.
(E) Traffic Impact Study – A Traffic Impact Study may be required when deemed necessary
by the Planning Board in its deliberation of the Site Plan application. For all developments
over 20,000 sq. ft. in gross floor area, or ten (10) residential dwelling units; or which would

involve more than 500 vehicle trips per day, a Traffic Impact Study shall be required.
(F) Minimum Distance Between Driveways – The minimum distance between driveways on
the same side of the street shall be in accordance with the following table from the Federal
Highway Administration’s Access Management for Streets and Highways:
Minimum Distance Between Driveways
Highway Speed (mph) Min. Driveway Spacing (ft.)
35 150’
40 185’
45 230’
50+ 275’
For driveways along highways with speeds over 50 mph, the driveway distance shall be determined
by the Planning Board, in consultation with NHDOT, and shall not be less than 275ft.
(G) Maximum Number of Driveways Per Lot – Lots without sufficient frontage to allow the
above minimum distance between driveways shall be permitted only one (1) driveway per
lot.
(H) Shared Driveways – For all new development or redevelopment adjacent to undeveloped
sites, and all other sites when possible, shared access driveways shall be required to be
constructed along the shared lot line. Additionally, access easements granting access to
the adjacent or undeveloped site(s) shall be incorporated into the site plan/subdivision,
and recorded at the Registry of Deeds.
(I) Shared Access – Wherever possible, easements and actual construction of driveways
and or shared access or cross access roads shall be established to allow for future
development and access to adjacent non-residential or multi-family parcels along the
Route 11 corridor. Such easements shall be recorded at the Registry of Deeds and shall
guarantee shared access across adjacent parcels for all parcel owners connecting to the
Shared Access Roads(s). Before any application for a shared access is approved, the
landowner(s) must submit a maintenance agreement and provide a deeded easement
that clearly defines each property owner’s rights and responsibilities.
Farmington Zoning Ordinance – adopted March 13, 2001, amended March 11, 2003; March 14, 2006; March 13, 2007; March 12, 2008; March 13, 2009; March 9,

uses exist, cross access and shared parking lots shall be utilized. Before any application for
a shared parking is approved, the landowner(s) must submit a maintenance agreement and provide a
deeded easement that clearly defines each property owner’s rights and responsibilities.
(J) Frontage Roads/Rear Access Roads – Wherever possible, and in consultation with
adjacent landowners, development along the Route 11 Corridor shall utilize Frontage or
Rear Access roads to access their sites. Such roads shall have limited, shared access points
to Route 11, and shall provide access for all lots along their route. Such roads shall be
privately owned and maintained by the adjoining lot owners whose properties are accessed
by the roadway. Frontage/Rear Access roads shall be required, unless the developer can
furnish written correspondence indicating that either the adjacent property owners are
unwilling to provide access easements or maintenance for the roadway, or that safety issues
would render such a roadway less safe than a traditional access point directly fronting on
Route 11.
(K) Access to Lots With Frontage on Multiple Streets – Lots with frontage on Route 11 and
another highway or local street, shall not be permitted to access Route 11, except where it
can be proven that other potential access points would cause greater environmental or traffic
impacts to the existing land and traffic patterns, or where a greater safety hazard would be
created by accessing another highway or local street, or where such access would create a
dead end roadway greater than 900 feet in length, as determined by the Planning Board.
Where access off Route 11 is desired, a Traffic Impact Study shall be required to provide
sufficient evidence for this to the Planning Board, as opposed to access from another
highway or local street.
Farmington Zoning Ordinance – adopted March 13, 2001, amended March 11, 2003; March 14, 2006; March 13, 2007; March 12, 2008; March 13, 2009; March 9,

(L) Minimum Driveway/Throat Length – The minimum length of driveways fronting on Route
11 shall be of sufficient length to accommodate on-site stacking of vehicles waiting to enter
the site. The design of the driveway shall, to the maximum extent possible, cause no vehicles
waiting to enter the site to remain on the highway. If a Traffic Impact Study is required for
the site, the minimum length of driveway(s) shall be of sufficient length to accommodate onsite
stacking of the maximum number of vehicles as defined by the peak period of operation
in the Traffic Impact Study for the site.
(M) Nodal Development – Wherever possible, development of shared access drives shall be utilized
to allow for future growth and development in nodes along the Route 11 corridor, rather than
traditional strip development. Wherever multi-structure development is proposed for a single lot,
or combination of lots, a shared driveway shall be utilized to provide for access to these
structures.
(N) Curb Cut Width - The width for a minor driveway curb cut serving primarily passenger vehicles
shall be no greater than twenty-four (24) feet, not including the radii. The width for a major driveway
curb cut shall be no greater than thirty-six (36) feet, not including the radii.
(O) Angle of Driveway - Access to the highway shall be at an angle of 90 degrees, wherever possible.
3.21 LANDSCAPING

4.02 WETLANDS CONSERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT
This ordinance shall be known as the “Wetlands Conservation Overlay District of the Town of
Farmington, N.H.” (Adopted March 10, 1992). By the authority granted in N.H. RSA 674:16-17
and RSA 674:20-21, and in the interest of public health, safety and general welfare, the
Farmington Wetlands Conservation Overlay District is hereby established to regulate the uses of
lands subject to standing water, flooding or high water tables for extended periods of time.
(A) Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety and general
welfare by controlling and guiding the use of land areas which are subject to standing water,
flooding or high water tables for extended periods of time. The intent of this article is:
1) To prevent the development of Structures and land uses on naturally occurring Wetlands
which will contribute to Pollution of surface and groundwater by sewage, sediment and/or
noxious substances;
2) To prevent the destruction of, or significant changes to natural Wetlands which provide flood
protection;
3) To protect rare, unique and unusual natural communities and species, both flora and fauna;
4) To protect wildlife habitats and maintain ecological balances;
5) To protect existing and potential water supplies and Aquifers (water bearing strata) and Aquifer
recharge areas;
6) To prevent the expenditure of municipal funds for the purposes of providing and/or maintaining
Essential Services and utilities which might be required as a result of misuse or abuse of
Wetlands; and
Farmington Zoning Ordinance – adopted March 13, 2001, amended March 11, 2003; March 14, 2006; March 13, 2007; March 12, 2008; March 13, 2009; March 9,
2010; March 8, 2011; March 13, 2012; March 12, 2013, March 11, 2014, March 10, 2015, March 8, 2016; March 29, 2017; March 14, 2018; March 12, 2019 119
7) To protect the Wetlands, watercourses, Water Bodies of the Town from degradation and help
maintain their natural functions and beauty.
(B) Location. The Wetlands Conservation Overlay district is defined as those areas of the Town of
Farmington which meet the definition of Wetlands as defined in Section 1.14 together with all
buffer areas associated herewith as herein provided. In all cases, the precise location of
Wetland areas shall be determined by the actual character of the land and the distribution of
Wetland indicators. Such determination shall be made by field inspection and testing conducted
by a Certified Wetland Scientist or Certified Soil Scientist.
(C) Inventory. The Commission or its designated agent (s) is encouraged to begin an inventory of
all Wetland areas, as defined by this article, and the creation of an official Wetland map of the
town. The Commission may amend the inventory and map from time to time as information
becomes available relative to more accurate delineation of Wetlands within the town.
(D) Wetlands Incorrectly Delineated.
1) If either the applicant or the Board questions the Wetland Conservation Overlay District
boundaries established under this article, the applicant shall engage a Wetland Scientist or
Certified Soil Scientist to conduct a field analysis to determine the precise location of the
Wetland Conservation District boundaries on the affected properties. The Wetland Scientist
or soil scientist shall submit a report of their findings to the Board and the Conservation
Commission including, but not limited to, a revised map of the area in question, a written onsite
field inspection report and test boring data if applicable.
2) Upon receipt of the report, the Board in consultation with the Commission may refer it for
review to a Wetland Scientist or Certified Soil Scientist of its choosing. The applicant shall be
responsible for any and all reasonable costs incurred by the Board in connection with this
independent review.
(E) Designation of Significant Wetlands and Buffer Zones.
(1) For purposes of this ordinance all Wetlands in Farmington are designated as either Class
One, Class Two or Class Three Wetlands. Those Wetlands designated as Class One or
Class Two Wetlands, based on an evaluation of the criteria and review standards specified
in paragraphs (2) and (3) below, are so significant that they merit protection.
(2) Class one Wetlands are those Wetlands that in and of themselves, based on an evaluation
of the functions listed in Ammann, Alan P. and A.L. Stone, March 1991, Method for the
Comparative Evaluation of Nontidal Wetlands in New Hampshire, NH DES-WRD-1991-3 are
exceptional or irreplaceable in their contribution to New Hampshire’s or Farmington’s natural
heritage and are therefore so significant, either taken alone or in conjunction with other
Wetlands, that they merit protection under this ordinance.
Farmington Zoning Ordinance – adopted March 13, 2001, amended March 11, 2003; March 14, 2006; March 13, 2007; March 12, 2008; March 13, 2009; March 9,

(3) Class Two Wetlands are those Wetlands, other than Class One, which based on an
evaluation of the functions in the above cited reference, are found to be so significant, either
taken alone or in conjunction with other Wetlands, that they merit protection under this
ordinance.
(4) Class Three Wetlands are those Wetlands which have not been determined by the
Commission to be so significant that they merit protection under this ordinance because they
have not been evaluated or because when last evaluated were determined not to be
sufficiently significant to merit protection under this ordinance.
(F) Initial Designations.
(1) Class One Wetlands: Any wetland designated in accordance with Section 4.02(E)(2) or
Section 4.02(K) shall be classified as a Class One Wetland.
(2) Class Two Wetlands shall include all Wetlands shown on the National Wetlands Inventory
Maps for the State of New Hampshire encompassing the Town of Farmington, and all
Wetlands contiguous to such mapped Wetlands unless determined otherwise by the
Commission as provided for in Section 4.02(E)(3) except for the following:
(a) Those Wetlands subsequently designated as Class one Wetlands; and
(b) The following categories of Wetlands shown on the National Wetland Inventory maps:
Riverine Lower Perennial Open Water (R20W) Riverine Lower Perennial
Beach/Bar (R2BB) Riverine Upper Perennial Open Water (R30W) Riverine

NHDES-WRD-1991-3. The functions that make a specific Wetland significant shall be
determined pursuant to Section 4.02(E).
(3) Class Three Wetlands are those Wetlands which are not designated as Class One or Two
Wetlands.
(G) Buffer Zones.
(1) Class One Buffers. The Commission may designate a buffer zone contiguous to any Class
One or Class Two wetland, that is no greater than one hundred (100) feet outward from the
boundaries of the Class One Wetland
(2) Class Two Buffers. Unless otherwise designated as provided for in Section 4.02(H)(3) or
4.02(K), there shall be a buffer of fifty (50) feet outward from the boundaries of a Class Two
Farmington Zoning Ordinance – adopted March 13, 2001, amended March 11, 2003; March 14, 2006; March 13, 2007; March 12, 2008; March 13, 2009; March 9,

2010; March 8, 2011; March 13, 2012; March 12, 2013, March 11, 2014, March 10, 2015, March 8, 2016; March 29, 2017; March 14, 2018; March 12, 2019 124
(3) the supply and protection of ground waters, (4) the control of sediment, (5)
the facilitation of drainage, (6) the control of Pollution, (7) the support of
recreational activities, (8) the promotion of public health and safety.
(b) The character and degree of injury to, or interference with safety, health or the
reasonable use of property, including downstream property, which would be caused
or threatened by the proposed activity, or the creation of conditions which may do so.
This includes recognition of potential damage from: (1) erosion, (2) turbidity, (3)
siltation, (4) loss of fish and wildlife and their habitat, (5) loss of habitat having
demonstrable natural, scientific or educational value, (6) loss or diminution of beneficial
aquatic organisms and Wetland plants, (7) the dangers of flooding and Pollution and
(8) the destruction of the economic, aesthetic, recreational and other public and private
uses and values of Wetlands to the community.
2) Mitigation. The following measures shall be used to mitigate adverse impacts on
protected functions, other than minimal impact, to the extent necessary to achieve no
net undue adverse effect:
(a) The proposed activity cannot practically be located on the Upland portion of
the site in question or on another site owned, controlled or available to satisfy
the basic project purpose; and
(b) All practicable measures have been taken to avoid adverse impacts on protected
functions; and
(c) The applicant has evaluated each of the protected functions in accordance with
the protocols established in Ammann, Alan P. and A. L. Stone, March 1991,
M e t h o d f o r the C o m p a r a t i v e Evaluation of Nontidal Wetlands in New
Hampshire, NHDES-WRD-1991-3; and
(d) The proposed use has been planned and designed to minimize potential adverse
impacts on the protected functions; and
(e) A plan has been developed for the prompt restoration of any of the adverse
impacts on protected functions.
3) Compensation. In rare cases it may be possible to reduce adverse impacts on protected
functions which cannot be avoided through mitigation by compensating for such impacts
so that there is no net undue adverse impact. Such compensation measures may include
establishing new Wetlands or enlarging the boundaries of an existing Wetland to
compensate for the adverse impact of a proposed use. Compensation to avoid undue
adverse impacts on protected functions of Class One Wetlands may only be considered
upon the showing that the adverse impacts are necessary in the course of meeting a
Farmington Zoning Ordinance – adopted March 13, 2001, amended March 11, 2003; March 14, 2006; March 13, 2007; March 12, 2008; March 13, 2009; March 9,

compelling public need to protect public health or safety. Compensation measures will be
allowed in either Class One or Class Two Wetlands only to reduce adverse impacts on
those protected functions that are compensable. Compensation may be possible for
adverse impacts on the following functions (*):
*water storage for flood water or storm runoff.
*nutrient retention or sediment trapping.
*wildlife habitat.
*open space and aesthetics.
Any compensation plan must demonstrate the following:
(a) There will be no net loss of the protected functions or acreage of significant
Wetlands, and;
(b) The compensation measures will be fully implemented prior to, or
concurrently with, the proposed use; and
(c) Where practicable, the compensation proposal shall be contiguous to the
impacted Wetlands; and
(d) The compensation measures shall be monitored and managed for a period
necessary to ensure full replacement of the protected functions in question and
any additional period that may be required by subsequent remedial measures
but in advent for less than five (5) years; and
(e) Shall be designed to be self-sustaining following the period for which monitoring
or management is required; and
(f) Adequate financial surety is provided to carry out the proposed
compensation including any necessary remedial measures; and
(g) The replacement Wetland will be permanently preserved by a conservation
easement or deed restriction conveyed to a suitable party or by other appropriate
means.

1. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of the Planned Business Development (PBD) is to allow
projects of innovative design and layout that would not otherwise be permitted under this
ordinance because of the strict application of zoning district or dimensional standards.
Typically, the PBD consists of a combination of land uses that provides a higher level of
standards through innovative land planning and site design concepts. The PBD shall not be
used merely as a mechanism to avoid the application of the requirements of the Business
Nodal District. The PBD district is further intended to:
a) Promote more economical and efficient use of land while providing a harmonious
grouping of a variety of land uses and buildings;
b) Promote innovative design of commercial areas and allow for greater densities when
additional site amenities are included in the development;
c) Create physical connections between existing and proposed developments in order to
achieve an integrated community with common open space, transportation, and public
service networks; and
d) Allow for innovative development projects that are consistent with the purpose and
intent of this Article and the Town of Farmington Master Plan and not as a device to
circumvent development regulations, standards, and good planning practice.
2. Lot. PBD designation shall be limited to lots of at least four (4) acres and that each such
designation shall be accompanied by the adoption of a Comprehensive Development Plan for
each lot so designated. Upon such designation and adoption, such lot shall become a "PBD”
for all purposes of the Zoning Ordinance.
3. Comprehensive Development Plan. The Planning Board shall require a Comprehensive
Development Plan for the full lot under consideration to be submitted by the applicant for its
review. Such Plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

a) A scaled drawing with a scale between 1” =100’ and 1” =50’, as appropriate
b) North arrow
c) Property lines
d) Tax map and parcel number
e) Proposed subdivision lines
f) Conceptual proposed site layout including streets, buildings, parking, open
spaces, driveways
g) Conceptual landscape plan
h) Typical building architectural profile or rendering
i) Remaining existing features including wet areas, steep slopes, utilities, infrastructure,
vegetation (tree lines), as appropriate
j) Easements or other encumbrances
4. Conditional Use Permit. Authority is granted to the Planning Board to issue a conditional use
permit in accordance with the standards of Paragraph F, Standards for Conditional Use Permit,
to approve a Comprehensive Development Plan. Compliance with the individual provisions
and standards of this Section shall constitute the conditions required for the issuance of a
conditional use permit.
5. Amendments to Comprehensive Development Plan. A Comprehensive Development
Plan for a PBD lot, once approved by the Planning Board, may not be amended other
than by action of the Planning Board upon an application submitted in accordance with
the provisions of the Town of Farmington’s Zoning Ordinance, including a statement
outlining the reasons for any such change.
6. Changes or Subdivision of PBD lot. Any changes to a portion of a PBD shall be subject
to the approved Comprehensive Development Plan or an approved amendment by the
Planning Board in accordance with this zoning article and Section 30 of the Site Plan
Regulations.
7. Site Plan Review. In addition to the submission and approval of a Comprehensive
Development Plan, the applicant shall also be required to submit a Site Plan in
conformance with the Town of Farmington Site Plan Review Regulations. Such review
may be conducted in phases to allow for incremental development of a site. However,
each phase shall conform to the Comprehensive Development Plan and each phase
must proceed through Site Plan Review.
8. Standards. The specific standards for a development within the PBD district are set forth
in the Site Plan Regulations, Section 30. In the event that a PBD zone document (Section
Farmington Zoning Ordinance – adopted March 13, 2001, amended March 11, 2003; March 14, 2006; March 13, 2007; March 12, 2008; March 13, 2009; March 9,

off- street parking spaces for purposes of all requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. Such
parking spaces may be provided on roads within the PBD lot, subject to the requirement
that such parking spaces and loading spaces lie entirely within the PBD lot. No parking
space shall be located so as to obstruct the safe flow of traffic.

3The New Hampshire Stormwater Manual is a planning tool for the communities, developers, designers, and members of regulatory boards, commissions, and
agencies involved in stormwater programs in New Hampshire. The NH Stormwater Manual addresses measures to manage stormwater runoff through site design,
pollutant source controls, structural Best Management Practices (including associated operation and maintenance measures), and construction-phase practices.
The Manual consists of three volumes: Volume 1: Stormwater and Antidegradation presents an overview of New Hampshire's stormwater program together with
related federal program requirements, describes New Hampshire's antidegradation provision (Env-Wq 1708) with respect to controlling water quality impacts due
to stormwater discharges, and provides an introduction to the non-structural and structural measures for managing stormwater. Volume 2: Post-Construction Best
Management Practices Selection and Design presents a detailed description of the structural BMPs applicable for use in New Hampshire for the prevention,
control, and treatment of stormwater. Volume 3: Erosion and Sediment Controls During Construction presents a selection of practices applicable during the
construction of projects to prevent adverse impacts to water resources as a result of land-disturbance activities.

7 According to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s Emergency Response Guidebook, large spills are
considered to involve volumes that are greater than fifty-five (55) US gallons (208 liters) for liquids and greater than six hundred
and sixty-six pounds (300 kilograms) for solids with regard to initial isolation and protection action distances. This is the standard
that is used by the majority of the voluntary first responder organizations.
8Chapter 2.1 Permanent (Post-Construction) Stormwater Management of The Innovative Land Use Planning Techniques
Handbook for Sustainable Land Use Development includes stormwater control recommendations for all development sites.
The provisions of Section (J)(III)(a) are consistent with provisions recommended in the handbook, including: recommended
discharge setbacks for large volumes of stormwater of between 75 and 400 feet; preparation of a Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP) (for industrial facilities), which is similar to a source control plan and provides details concerning
how operational or structural BMPs segregate clean from contaminated stormwater; and maintaining vertical separation
(undisturbed soil) between the bottom of stormwater infiltration or unlined filtration practices and the average seasonal high
water table.

TOWN OF FARMINGTON
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
SECTION 1. AUTHORITY
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Farmington Planning Board by the voters of the Town of
Farmington on November 19, 1975 and in accordance with the provisions of RSA 674:35 of the
New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated, and as amended, the Farmington Planning Board
adopts the following regulations governing the subdivision of land in the Town of Farmington,
New Hampshire, hereinafter known as Farmington Subdivision Regulations.
SECTION 2. PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of these regulations is to provide for:
? the orderly present and future development of the Town by promoting the public health,
safety, convenience and welfare of its residents;
? the harmonious development of the Town of Farmington, including its natural and
manmade environments;
? open spaces of adequate proportions; and
? the proper arrangement and coordination of streets within subdivisions in relation to other
existing or planned streets or with other features of the town so as to impose a convenient
system.
These regulations apply to Planning Board review and approval or disapproval of all
subdivisions as defined by RSA 672:14 and minor lot line adjustments or boundary agreements.
They do not apply to voluntary mergers as defined by RSA 674:39-a.
SECTION 3. CONFLICTING PROVISIONS AND VALIDITY
Whenever the regulations made under the authority hereof differ from those prescribed by any
statute, ordinance, or other regulations, that provision which imposes the greater restriction or the
highest standard shall govern.
If any section, clause, provision, portion or phrase of these regulations shall be held to be invalid
or unconstitutional by any court of competent authority, such holding shall not affect, impair or
invalidate any other section, clause, provision, portion or phrase of these regulations.

or is directly across the street or stream from the land under consideration by the local land
2
use board; and (2) affected municipalities and the regional planning commission(s) in the
event of developments having regional impact. For purposes of receiving testimony only,
and not for purpose of notification, the term "abutter" shall include any person who is able to
demonstrate that his land will be directly affected by the proposal under consideration. For
purposes of receipt of notification by a municipality of a local land use board hearing, in the
case of an abutting property being under a condominium or other collective form of
ownership, the term abutter means the officers of the collective or association, as defined in
RSA 356-B: 3, XXIII.
Applicant: Means the owner of record of the land to be subdivided, or his/her designated
agent.
Application, Complete: Means a final plat and all accompanying materials and fees as

Approval, Conditional: Means recognition by the Planning Board, certified by written
endorsement on the plat, that the plat is neither finally approved nor ready for filing with the
Registry of Deeds until such time as certain conditions, set forth by the Board, are met. This
is not to be confused with a plat that has been approved subject to certain conditions that
would be met as part of the implementation of the plan.
As-Built Plans: Revised set of plans submitted by an Applicant upon completion of the
project. The as-built plans shall reflect all changes made in the field during the construction
process, and show the exact dimensions, geometry, and location of all elements of the work
completed under the approved plan. As as-built plan may also be called a record drawing. A
digital copy of the as-built plans must also be submitted.
Board: Means the Planning Board of the Town of Farmington.
Buildable Area: That portion of a parcel upon which a structure may be erected. The
following are not to be included in the buildable area: steep slopes; wetland soils; rock

Deeds for recording.
Public Hearing: Means a meeting, notice of which must be given per RSA 675:7 and 676:4,I
(d), at which the public is allowed to offer testimony.
Public Meeting: Means the regular business meeting of the Planning Board as required per
RSA 673:10. Notice must be posted at least 24 hours in advance and the meeting must be
open to the public, although participation by the public is at the discretion of the Board.
Right-of-Way: Means a strip of land for which legal right of passage has been granted by the
landowner or utility company to provide access to a lot which lacks adequate frontage.
Setback: The horizontal distance between a Structure and the Lot boundaries, measured at
right angles or radial to the Lot boundary.
Sewage Disposal System (Individual): Means any on-site sewage disposal or treatment
system that receives either sewage or other wastes, or both. For the purposes of this
regulation, this means all components of the system, including the leach field.

Subdivision: Means the division of a lot, tract, or parcel of land into two (2) or more lots,
plats, sites, or other divisions of land for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale,
rent, lease, condominium conveyance or building development. The division of a parcel of
land held in common and subsequently divided into parts among several owners shall be
4
deemed a subdivision.
Subdivision, Major: Means a subdivision of five (5) or more lots, or one which involves the
creation of new streets and/or utilities, regardless of the number of lots.
Subdivision, Minor: Means a subdivision of land into not more than four (4) lots for
building development purposes, with no potential for resubdivision, and requiring no roads,
utilities or other municipal improvements.
Wetlands: Means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a
frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal conditions does support,
a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands
include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.
SECTION 5. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBDIVISION OF LAND
A. Character of Land for Subdivision: Land of such character that it cannot, in the
judgment of the Board, be safely used for building development purposes because of
exceptional danger to health or peril from fire, flood, poor drainage, excessive slope, or
other hazardous conditions, shall not be platted for residential, commercial, or industrial
subdivision, nor for such other uses as may increase danger to life or property, or
aggravate the flood hazard.
B. Premature Subdivision: The Board may provide against such scattered or premature
subdivision of land as would involve danger or injury to health, safety, or prosperity by
reason of the lack of water supply, sewage disposal, drainage, transportation, schools, fire
protection, or other public services which necessitate the excessive expenditure of public
funds for the supply of such services.
C. Preservation of Existing Features: Wherever feasible, suitable steps shall be taken to
preserve and protect significant existing features such as trees, scenic points, stone walls,
rock outcroppings, water bodies, and historic landmarks. Where possible, the boundary
line(s) should follow stone walls.
D. Open Space: In the case of major subdivisions, the Planning Board may require that
suitable areas of open land of reasonable size for the nature of the subdivision submitted
be set aside as parks or for other recreational purposes.
E. Compliance With Regulations: No subdivision of land shall be made, and no land in
any subdivision shall be sold or offered for sale or lease, and no street or utility
construction shall be started until a final plat, prepared in accordance with the
requirements of these regulations, has been approved by the Board, and other required
permits have been issued.
5

A. General Information
1. Application shall be made using appropriate forms provided by the Planning Board
and shall conform to the application procedures and any other applicable regulations
adopted by the Town.
10
2. Changes in lot line locations require subdivision application or a Boundary Line
Adjustment application, and approval in the same manner as ordinary subdivision as
defined in these regulations.
3. The Board may make a visual on-site inspection of the land at any stage of the
proposal. Inspection is to be at such time when the site is free of snow cover, unless
the Board is otherwise satisfied that such inspection is not required.
4. Approval of the plan by the Planning Board shall not constitute an acceptance by the
Town of the dedication of any proposed street, highway, park or other public open
space.
5. The Planning Board may approve the plan with such conditions as may be necessary
to insure proper completion of the required improvements.
6. All subdivision applications shall be reviewed by the Technical Review Committee
(TRC).
The purpose of the TRC meeting is to allow department heads to review an
application in order to identify issues of concern related to the department’s function
area. Following this review, the TRC will provide comments and recommendations
to the Planning Board.
B. Preliminary Conceptual Consultation
1. The Applicant may request a meeting with the Board to discuss a proposal in
conceptual form and in general terms. Although this phase is strictly optional, the

the discussion. The sketch may not include any technical information such as survey
or engineering data, soils or wetlands delineations. Approximate location of any
special features, such as wetlands, floodplain, stonewalls, cemeteries, may be
included on the simple sketch.
C. Design Review Phase
1) Prior to submission of an application for Board action, an Applicant may request
to meet with the Board or its designee for non-binding discussions beyond the
conceptual and general stage, involving more specific design and engineering
details of the potential application.
2) The design review phase may proceed only after proper notification, as set forth
in Paragraph J of this Section.
3) Statements made by Board members shall not be the basis for disqualifying said
members or invalidating any action eventually taken on the application.
4) An Applicant wishing to engage in a Design Review shall submit a written
request to be placed on the next available Planning Board agenda to the Chairman
of the Planning Board. The written request must be received on or before the
submission deadline published by the Planning Board for the preferred meeting of
the Board.

above; and
f) A rough sketch of the site which shows the following:
i) Approximate location of proposed lot lines.
ii) Approximate lot measurements, and area of new lots.
iii) Street(s) on which lots have frontage, including proposed streets;
iv) Special features, including approximate location of wetlands, flood
hazard areas, etc., where applicable.
6) An Applicant shall pay the public notice fees and the abutter notification fees as
indicated in the fee schedule adopted by the Planning Board and in effect when
the application is submitted.
7) An Applicant shall meet with the Technical Review Committee (TRC) at least
two (2) weeks prior to the Planning Board meeting. The Applicant may request to
meet with the TRC at any time during the design process to obtain guidance on
technical issues related to the proposal.
D. Submission of Completed Application
1) A completed application shall be submitted to the Planning Department on or
before the submission deadline published by the Planning Board. A completed
application shall consist of all data required in Section 8, Subdivision
Requirements, of these regulations.
2) At the next scheduled meeting, the Board will determine whether the application
is complete. If the application is incomplete, the Board shall notify the Applicant
of the deficiencies in the application in accordance with RSA 676:3 and shall
advise the Applicant of a date certain to provide the necessary information.
Failure of the Applicant to provide the required information by said date will
result in a finding the application is incomplete. Upon that finding, the Applicant
will need to resubmit the application under a new notification procedure.
3) Acceptance of an application as complete shall only occur at a meeting of the
Planning Board after due notification has been given according to Paragraph J of
this Section. Acceptance will be by affirmative vote of a majority of the Board
members present.
4) Once an application has been accepted as complete by the Board, the 65-day
review period begins.
13
E. Board Action on Completed Application
1) The Board shall begin consideration of the Completed Application upon
acceptance. The Board shall act to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove
the Completed Application within 65 days of acceptance.
2) An Applicant may waive the requirement for Board action within the time periods
specified in these regulations and consent to such extension as may be mutually
agreeable.
3) The Board may apply to the Selectmen for an extension not to exceed an
additional 90 days before acting to approve, conditionally approve or disapprove
an application.
4) Approval of the application shall be certified by written endorsement on the Plat
and signed and dated by the Chairman of the Board. If any application is
disapproved, the grounds for such disapproval shall be adequately stated in the
records of the Planning Board and in written notice given to the Applicant within
five (5) business days of the decision.
5) An approved plan shall be recorded by the Planning Board with the Strafford
County Register of Deeds upon satisfaction of conditions of approval, subject to
the requirements of Paragraph G of this section.
F. Failure of the Planning Board to Act
1) In the event that the Planning Board does not act on an accepted application
within the prescribed time period, the Applicant may petition the Selectmen to
issue an order directing the Planning Board to act within 30 days.
2) If the Planning Board fails to act within 40 days of receiving this directive from
the Selectmen, the Selectmen must approve the application unless they find in
writing that the plan does not comply with a local regulation. In the event the
Selectmen fail to act, the Applicant may petition superior court to approve the
plan.
G. Conditional Approval
The Board may grant conditional approval of an application, but the plat will not be
signed or recorded until all of the conditions of approval have been met. A further public
hearing is not required when such conditions:
1) are administrative in nature;
2) involve no discretionary judgment on the part of the Board;
14
3) Involve the Applicant's possession of permits and approvals granted by other
boards or agencies, such as the Department of Transportation, the Wetlands
Board, or Water Supply and Pollution Control Division; however, any subsequent
change to the plan required by such approvals would constitute grounds for a new
application process.
If the Applicant has not complied with the conditions of approval within one (1) year
from the date of approval, the approval is considered null and void and the Applicant
must submit a new subdivision application.
H. Expedited Review
1) The Planning Board may allow for an expedited review of applications for lot line
adjustments or minor subdivisions as defined by these regulations.
2) The application may be submitted, accepted as complete and voted on at the same
meeting, provided the public notice so indicates.
I. Public Hearing
Prior to the approval of an application, a public hearing shall be held.
J. Notification
1) Notice of a Design Review, submission of an application, or a Public Hearing
shall be given by the Board to the abutters, the Applicant, holders of conservation,
preservation or agricultural preservation restrictions or easements, and every
engineer, architect, land surveyor or soil scientist whose professional seal appears
on any plat.
2) Notice shall be by certified mail, mailed at least ten (10) days prior to the
submission. The public will be given notice at the same time, by posting at the
Municipal Office Building, Old Town Hall, publication in Foster’s Daily
Democrat, and on the Town’s website at www.farmington.nh.us.
3) The notice shall give the date, time, and place of the Planning Board meeting at
which the application will be formally submitted to the Board, shall include a

or uses. This buffer shall adequately shield the residential properties from the
adverse effects of the non-residential use. No roads shall be located within any
part of this buffer zone.
Where appropriate, existing trees and vegetation must be incorporated into the
buffer strips or landscaping design. Buffer strips must contain vegetation which
26
will screen the view from adjacent residential property during all seasons, this
screening must exclude visual contact between uses and create a strong
impression of the separation of spaces. Fencing alone may be considered an
acceptable method of screening only if granted a waiver in accordance with
Section 14, Paragraph C – Waivers.

measures shall be taken to preserve the scenic quality of such roads. These
measures may balance the needs and requirements for safety and health, but
should only minimally consider economic expediency.
G. Bridges
Bridges must be built according to the N.H. Department of Transportation manual,
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, current edition including all
amendments. All bridge plans must be approved by the State Engineers prior to
construction.

may request an advisory opinion from the Conservation Commission in the
determination of the value of natural features and the boundaries of such natural
systems. Such areas include watercourses, wetland areas, steep slopes, large or
unique trees, groves, or special habitats. Natural features that provide buffers
between lots, or sections, of a subdivision should be preserved to enhance privacy
and aesthetic value.
2. Buffer Strips. The Planning Board may require the designation of buffer strips of
at least fifty feet width around surface water, wetlands, or other natural features
which may be adversely affected by erosion or stormwater runoff. The Board
may require a vegetative buffer to provide screening where non-residential
developments abut a residential zone.
3. Parks. The Board may require the dedication or reservation of such open space
within the subdivision for park, playground or other recreational or open space
purposes, for the residents of the subdivision.
The Board shall also require of the developer that he/she supply and plant such
trees and shrubbery as are deemed compatible to the environmental design of the
neighborhood. It shall also be stipulated by covenant upon the plan that such
open spaces shall not contain signs other than street directional or place-name
signs. Upon approval of the final plans and plantings, if the park is dedicated for
public use, the maintenance of said landscaped areas shall be the responsibility of
the community. If the park is solely for subdivision use, the maintenance of said
landscaped areas shall be the responsibility of the residents of the subdivision.
4. Tree Planting. The planting of shade trees within all subdivision layouts where
residential, commercial, or industrial development is to take place may be
required of the developer who shall supply planting plans to the Board.
M. Stormwater Drainage and Erosion Control
1. An adequate surface stormwater drainage system for the entire subdivision area
shall be provided. Storm drainage shall be carried to existing water courses or
connect to existing storm drains. No new drainage ways shall be created unless
necessary easements are obtained. Such easements shall be duly recorded on the
plat and the property deeds involved.
No increase in surface runoff shall be permitted if such increased runoff passes
beyond the property lines of the parcel upon which such development occurs,
unless it is within an approved public storm drainage system. Storm drains and
other subdivision drainage facilities shall be based upon a design flow to
accommodate a 50-year/24-hour storm. All water courses shall be designed so as
31
not to create erosive velocities. Calculations of runoff used to determine
stormwater system design shall be submitted for Planning Board review.
Stormwater drainage system design shall incorporate stormwater BMPs as
identified in the NH Stormwater Manual, December 2008.
2. Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed
soil and surface conditions during and after development. Sediment in the runoff
water shall be trapped by the use of sediment basins or other acceptable methods
until the disturbed area is stabilized. Diversions, sediment retention basins, and
other erosion/sedimentation control structures shall be constructed prior to any
on-site grading or disturbance of existing surface material.
3. A stormwater system shall be constructed in accordance with the following
requirements:
a. The stormwater system shall include an adequate number and sizes of
catch basins and/or drop inlets, and shall be fully designed to handle all
computed or reasonably anticipated stormwater drainage. The minimum
size, slope, and location of the pipe shall be determined by a qualified
engineer and installed under his supervision.
b. No stormwater pipe, catch basin, drainage inlet, or other pipe floor drain,
draining surface water shall be connected to any sanitary sewer system,
pipe or other part of said system. All stormwater pipe shall be inspected
and approved by the Town Engineer before covered. Inspection shall be
completed on a normal workday within a 24-hour period after
notification.
c. The Applicant shall provide satisfactory information that his stormwater
drainage system will not cause flooding or unreasonable deposits of such
waters upon or onto adjacent private or public lands or streets, unless deed
easements for the same are obtained in the name of, or to be deeded to, the
Town of Farmington.
4. Low Impact Development techniques should be incorporated wherever practical.
N. Traffic Impact and Mitigation Analysis
All proposed developments shall be reviewed by the Board to ascertain that adequate provisions
have been made by the owner or his/her agent for traffic safety. To facilitate this review, the
Applicant may be required to provide a traffic impact analysis when deemed necessary by the
Board due to the size, location, or any other traffic generating characteristics of the development.
1. In addition to the requirements of Section 3.20 Paragraph E of the Town of
Farmington Zoning Ordinance, a traffic impact and mitigation analysis shall be
32
required in the following circumstances:

Professional Engineer. This analysis shall be prepared to meet, at a minimum, the
NH-DOT’s Policy for the Permitting of Driveways and Other Access to the State
Highway System (current edition, including all revisions) and NHDOT
Intersection Capacity Analysis Guidance (current edition, including all revisions).
3. Depending on the magnitude of the proposed development, acceptable report
formats may include: a letter report, a formal traffic impact and access study, or a
technical memorandum addressing specific issues and concerns. All report types
shall include a technical appendix containing all pertinent traffic data and
analyses used in the preparation of the study.
4. Where applicable, reports shall include a qualitative as well as quantitative
analysis including, but not limited to, details concerning the following impacts
and proposed efforts to mitigate these impacts:

ARTICLE I: GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 1. Authority.
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Planning Board by the voters of the Town of
Farmington at the March 11, 2003 Annual Town Meeting and in accordance with the
New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated (NH RSA), Chapter 674:43-44 as amended,
the Planning Board adopts the following regulations governing the review of site plans
for multi-family dwellings and non-residential uses. These regulations shall be entitled,
"Site Plan Review Regulations."
Section 2. Purpose.
The general purpose of this chapter is to guide the character of non-residential and multifamily
development, re-development, expansion, and change of use in order to provide
for the health, safety, convenience, prosperity, and general welfare of the Town's
inhabitants, businesses and visitors. Throughout these regulations, the Board seeks to
balance the demand for growth, development and change with the need to preserve and
enhance those qualities, which make Farmington a safe and desirable place to live, work
and visit. In keeping with this general purpose, the following are specific objectives of
this chapter:
A. To evaluate the landowner's rights to use their land while considering the
corresponding rights of abutting landowners and the public at large to be protected
from undue hazards, disturbances, nuisances, pollution and diminution of property
values;
B. To protect public safety by means such as requiring appropriate provision and
arrangement of roads, driveways, sidewalks, traffic aisles, parking, loading areas and
emergency vehicle accesses;
C. To provide for fire safety and prevention;
D. To promote the harmonious and aesthetically pleasing development of the Town,
ensuring visual harmony of neighborhoods, providing adequate provision of
greenspace and open space, protecting the natural beauty of the Town and enhancing
the quality of life for residents;
E. To maintain the vitality of the tourist economy while allowing economic growth in
all sectors of the economy;
F. To protect environmental quality by means such as controlling erosion and providing
for sanitary sewage disposal; and
G. To ensure the provision of adequate facilities and services as are necessary to serve
the proposed uses.

VILLAGE CENTER DISTRICT;
• The Planning Board provides a MINOR REVIEW; or
• The Planning Board provides a FULL REVIEW.
The following criteria specify the level of review necessary for a proposal to develop a
commercial or multi-family site:
A. Not Applicable. The determination of "not applicable" by the Board shall mean
that no site plan review approval is necessary, although other types of approvals
or permits may be necessary to comply with other municipal codes and an
application shall be kept on file. The Site Plan Review Regulations shall be
deemed not applicable for the following:
1. Temporary events which require no permanent alterations to the site and
which function safely within the approved configuration of the site as
determined by the Board; or
2. Special events approved by the Board of Selectmen.
B. Minor Review. A Minor Review by the Planning Board shall be required for any
development, which does not qualify to be not applicable, or full review.
C. Change of Business Use in the Village Center District requires review by the
Code Enforcement Officer (CEO). The CEO will determine if the proposed
change is eligible for this expedited review according to the criteria include in
Article II Section 5.1 of these regulations.
D. Full Review. A Full Review by the Planning Board shall be required for the
following:
1. establishment of non-residential use where no non-residential use
currently exists;
Farmington Site Plan Review Regulations Amended May 6, 2014; March 29, 2016

applicant's discretion, and are separate and apart from the formal consideration of the
application. The following shall apply:
A. Preliminary Conceptual Consultation. This meeting shall be directed at a
review of the basic concept of the proposal and suggestions, which might be of
assistance in resolving problems with meeting requirement during final
consideration. Such consultation shall not bind either the applicant or the
Board and statements made by Board members shall not be the basis for
disqualifying said members or invalidating any action taken. The Board and

Section 12. Application Acceptance.
Before an application is reviewed by the Board, it must be accepted by a formal vote of
the Board. The applicant shall attend this meeting to ensure that questions can be
answered and issues clarified if necessary. Per RSA 676:4,I (b), the Board shall vote to
accept the application only if it determines that the application is complete per this
chapter, and such decision must occur within 30 days of application submission per RSA
676:4,I(c). Upon acceptance, review of the application may proceed. If an application is
not accepted, the Board may proceed with Design Review, but as stated in Section 8,
such discussion shall not be binding on the applicant or Board. The Design Review
meeting may be continued to another date for Application Acceptance without further
notice.
Section 13. Applicant's Presentation (Optional).
Following application acceptance, at each meeting, the Board shall offer an applicant a
brief opportunity in which to make a general presentation to the Board and the audience.
The applicant is solely responsible for bringing any audio-visual materials and equipment
needed. This presentation should include a description of the proposed project and a
general description of the design, layout, and so forth. This is not the forum to raise
specific issues, therefore, the presentation should remain general in nature.
Section 14. Public Hearing.
The Board shall open a public hearing following application acceptance and the
applicant's presentation (if any). The purpose shall be to solicit public input, comments,
questions and concerns. The Chairman may temporarily suspend public comment during
the public hearing to allow the Board time to deliberate, vote on waivers, and so forth.
The public hearing may be continued if an additional meeting is required. Only when all
pertinent, new public input is complete shall the hearing be closed. The applicant shall be
responsible for attending the public hearing, including all continuations, to ensure that
questions can be answered and issues clarified if necessary.
Section 15. Decision.
Pursuant to RSA 676:4,I(c), the Board shall issue a decision within sixty-five (65) days of
application acceptance, subject to time extensions per RSA 676:4,I (f). Applications
which are not accepted require no decision. The Board must approve, conditionally
approve, or deny the application, as follows:
A. Approval. The Board shall grant approval to an application when it fully
complies with this chapter, including both design standards and compliance
with procedures, subject to waivers granted and grandfathered rights.
B. Conditional Approval. The Board may grant conditional approval to an
application when minor additional action by the applicant will bring the
Farmington Site Plan Review Regulations Amended May 6, 2014; March 29, 2016
11
application into full compliance for Approval. This may include payment of
fees, changes in design, and other matters, subject to the requirements of RSA
676:4,I (i):
1. minor plan changes, whether or not imposed by the Board as a result of a
public hearing, compliance with which is administrative and which does
not involve discretionary judgment; or
2. conditions which are in themselves administrative and which involve no
discretionary judgment on the part of the Board; or
3. conditions with regard to the applicant's possession of permits and
approvals granted by other governmental units; or
4. bonding, filing fees, or other required fees; or
5. conditional approval shall be valid for a period of one (1) year. The
Planning Board may, at its discretion, extend the Conditional Approval
beyond one year, in one-year increments. Extensions beyond the second
year shall only be granted if the only outstanding conditions are State
approvals and the applicant can demonstrate that such approvals were
requested in a timely fashion.
C. Disapproval. The Board shall disapprove an application when it fails to comply
with the design standards or procedures of this chapter, for failure to meet
reasonable deadlines established by the Board, or for failure to pay fees. If the
Board includes the phrase "without prejudice" in the motion to disapprove, it
signifies that the application was denied for procedural reasons rather than
design reasons, and that it may be re-submitted without design changes as a
new application to the Board at a later date.
If requested in writing, the applicant may waive the requirement for planning board
action within the time periods specified above and consent to such extension as may be
mutually agreeable (RSA 676:4,I (f)); or
The planning board may apply to the Selectmen for an extension not to exceed an
additional 90 days before acting to approve or disapprove an application (RSA 676:4,I (f-
)).
Upon failure of the Board to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the
application, the Selectmen may order the planning board to act within 30 days. If the
board still fails to act, the Selectmen must approve the plan within 40 days, unless it can
state in writing some specific regulation with which the application does not comply
with. The failure of the Selectmen to act on such order shall, upon petition of the
applicant, constitute grounds for the Superior Court to issue an order approving the application,
if the Court determines that the proposal complies with existing subdivision
regulations and zoning and other ordinances.

As required by RSA 676:3, within five (5) business days of the meeting at which an
approval is granted, the Town shall issue a Notice of Decision which states the final
decision reached by the Board regarding the application. In the case of a conditional
approval, the Notice of Decision shall state all conditions to be met for final approval.
Upon fulfillment of the stated conditions the Board shall issue a new Notice of Decision
stating that all conditions have been satisfied, and shall sign and record the plats if
applicable. In the case of a denial, the Notice of Decision shall state the reasons for denial
as required by RSA 676:4,I(h) and RSA 676:3,I.

installed in conformance with all ADA standards, and/or those standards
contained in Table 20(I)/4.19. The Planning Board may require a higher
standard than those contained in the ADA requirements, including
signalization and lighting, when deemed appropriate by the Board.
(5) Unless otherwise designated in Table 20(I)/4.19, sidewalks shall be made of
concrete, with vertical granite curbing, unless waived by the Planning Board.
In the event of a waiver, the minimum standard for sidewalks shall be
bituminous concrete with vertical concrete curbing.
(6) Where permitted by the Planning Board, and if permitted within the Right Of
Way, sidewalks may take the form of pedestrian accessways, separated from
the roadway by a vegetated buffer. Such accessways shall be either paved or
gravel, and shall accommodate pedestrian and other non-motorized means of
transportation. Such accessways shall only be permitted by the Planning
Board in zones outside of the Village Center (VC) District.
a. In the event that a vegetated swale and separated pedestrian accessway are
proposed, the curbing requirements may be waived by the Planning Board.
(7) When along a private road, sidewalk maintenance shall be the responsibility
of the Homeowners Association, or other similar body of ownership. All
sidewalks shall be maintained to allow for adequate pedestrian access in all
seasons, including snow removal, and shall be repaired, as necessary, to
ensure a safe, useable surface for pedestrian access. The above requirements
shall be included in a Covenant, Homeowners Association Bylaws, or other
similar legal document, acceptable to the Town, and shall run with the land, in
perpetuity, unless or until accepted by the Town.
(8) The Planning Board may, where it deems appropriate for pedestrian
circulation and safety, waive a portion of the sidewalk requirements within a
site and require that pedestrian accessways be installed adjacent to the site to
better accommodate pedestrian safety and access to the site and to connect up
with existing or proposed infrastructure adjacent to the site. Such
improvements shall be completed by the developer, and may constitute up to
100% of the valuation of the sidewalk waiver within the site.
(9) Pedestrian Rights Of Way not less than fourteen (14) feet wide may be
required by the Planning Board where deemed essential to provide circulation
or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation or other
community facilities. All sidewalks within a 1.5 mile radius of schools shall

detailed in Table 20(I)/4.19, and shall accommodate a fourteen (14) foot
Pedestrian Right Of Way, or if a fourteen (14) foot Pedestrian Right Of Way
cannot be accommodated, the Pedestrian Right Of Way shall be the widest
extent possible, up to Fourteen (14) feet.
(10) To ensure safe pedestrian accommodations for all school children and parents,
for all developments with 1.5 miles of a public school, the Planning Board
shall require sidewalk construction to be constructed according to the
standards of the Urban Residential (UR) District (below). These standards
shall not be waived. Any additional safety features (crosswalks, signalization,
guardrails, etc.) shall be required at the discretion of the Planning Board.
(11) The Planning Board may require a higher standard than those contained in the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

parking is located;
4. the lot providing the parking documents excess parking spaces that are
available based on parking standards in these Regulations; and
5. a recorded parking easement which specifies the number and location of
parking spaces is provided to the Board.
C. Village Center District. In recognizing the challenges in providing off-street
parking in older downtown districts, this Section seeks to allow effective
innovative and collaborative solutions to meeting the parking needs of the Village
Center District. The following methods for providing adequate parking in the
Village Center District will be considered by the Planning Board:
1. The Planning Board may allow off-street parking to be more than six
hundred (600) feet from the site if it finds that the distance is reasonable
given the nature of the proposed use. Additionally, such parking may be
shared if the Planning Board finds that there is adequate parking
capacity to meet the parking requirements and that shared parking is
controlled through a leasehold or other enforceable agreement.
2. For nonresidential uses, off-street parking in a municipal parking Lot
provided by the Town of Farmington may be allowed subject to a
written finding by the Planning Board, subject to the approval of the
Board of Selectmen, that there is adequate available parking to meet the
needs of the use based upon the parking standards of this regulation.
3. The Planning Board may allow legal on-street parking to be used to meet
the parking requirement of nonresidential use in the Village Center
District if it finds that this parking can reasonably be expected to be
available for customers of the use and is located within reasonable
proximity to the use.
4. Where multiple uses of a Lot occurs, off-street parking shall be provided
for each use in accordance with this section. Where the applicant can
demonstrate and document non-conflicting periods of use, shared use of
parking spaces may be permitted by the Planning Board.
Farmington Site Plan Review Regulations Amended May 6, 2014; March 29, 2016
24
5. Travel and queuing aisles associated with off-street parking, drive-in
facilities and motor vehicle fuel pumps shall be provided and shall not
interfere with the use of or be part of the required off-street parking.
6. The following minimum number of spaces, rounded up to the nearest
whole number, shall be provided and maintained for each use on a Lot,
including each use within all buildings. The Planning Board may reduce
the required parking for the reuse of a building existing at the time of
adoption of this provision by up to 30%. In granting a reduction, the
Planning Board must find that:
(a) the reduction will not create or worsen parking problems in the
neighborhood, and
(b) the required number of spaces cannot be reasonably accommodated
on the Lot.
7. The maximum number of employees scheduled during peak demand/shift
shall be used in calculating the number of required parking spaces when
“employee” is referenced in the list below.
8. Gross floor area shall be used in calculating the number of required
parking spaces, unless otherwise noted.
D. Minimum Number of Handicap Parking Spaces. Each site shall provide the
appropriate number of handicap parking spaces, as specified by New Hampshire
Code of Administrative Rules, PART Ha 304.02, as amended.
Section 22. Parking Lot Design.
Parking lots shall meet the following design requirements, in addition to any other
applicable design requirements contained in this Chapter:
A. Aisle Widths. Minimum aisle widths in parking lots shall be 18 feet for oneway
aisles, and 24 feet for two-way aisles.
B. All parking lots, loading areas and travel aisles shall be paved with
bituminous concrete or concrete.
C. Parking Space Dimensions. Minimum parking space sizes shall be 10 feet
wide by 20 feet long. Handicap parking spaces shall be 11 feet wide by 20
feet long and must adjoin a 5-foot access aisle, which may be shared by
adjoining handicap parking spaces.
D. Traffic Control Islands. In any parking lot, no more than two aisles, double
or single, may run generally parallel to one another without separation by a
raised, curbed traffic control island which runs parallel to and the full length
of the aisles. Traffic control islands shall be a minimum of twelve feet in
width. At the ends of each traffic control island there shall be 12 foot-wide
raised islands, which shall extend (on both sides, if parking rows are double)
Farmington Site Plan Review Regulations Amended May 6, 2014; March 29, 2016
25
the full length of the parking stalls. The applicant, if desired, may shorten
the main traffic control islands no more than 14 feet at each end to better
allow for the removal of snow. If the main traffic control island is proposed
to be shortened, pavement markings will be required to prohibit throughtraffic.
The Board may require additional traffic control islands to prevent
or correct traffic safety problems. Curbing shall be granite or concrete. The
board may wave control islands for 40 or less parking spaces.
E. Traffic Circulation. The parking lot design shall be such that there is safe
and adequate traffic circulation, and room to stack exiting vehicles separate
from the entering traffic lane(s).
Section 23. Loading.
All non-residential sites shall provide off-street loading facilities. These facilities shall be
located and designed to minimize traffic flow disruptions of entering and exiting
vehicles, and so that delivery vehicles can be parked completely out of the right-of-way.
Loading facilities shall be designed such that delivery vehicles do not need to stop or
reverse direction on Town roads.
Section 24. Snow Removal.
Snow removal shall be considered for all sites, and the general plan for snow removal
shall be indicated in a note. Locations for snow storage shall be designated on the plat, or
there shall be a note indicating that all snow shall be removed from site.
Section 25. Pedestrian Access and Circulation.
All sites shall provide for safe pedestrian access and circulation. Such provision shall
include sidewalk access to existing street side sidewalks if applicable, pedestrian aisles
through parking lots, and other facilities as are appropriate for the site.
Section 26. Lighting.
Lighting of sites shall be designed to prevent off-site disturbance, nuisance or hazard. All
outdoor light sources shall be designed, directed and/or shielded such that the nighttime
lighting is primarily contained on the site, shielding to the extent necessary abutting
properties and roads. All lighting in the Town of Farmington is required to have fullcutoff
shielding. No light source shall be permitted if that light causes glare or other
safety problems on an adjacent street. Outdoor lighting fixtures shall not be mounted
higher than 30 feet. The Board may reduce the permitted heights to reduce or eliminate
undue adverse impacts.
Indirect lighting shall be used on signs advertising goods or services offered on the
premises. Moving, fluttering, blinking or flashing lights or signs are not permitted.
Farmington Site Plan Review Regulations Amended May 6, 2014; March 29, 2016

Section 27. Storm Drainage.
Storm drainage of the site shall be designed with provisions for detention/retention and
gradual release of stormwater. This shall include provisions for upgrading the existing
drainage system if it is inadequate. All additional stormwater and runoff, which results
from the proposed development, shall be retained on-site and shall not drain onto
adjacent properties, roads or waterways. Drainage plans and calculations, prepared and
certified by a licensed NH Professional Engineer, shall be submitted with the application.
Drainage facilities shall be designed to accommodate 50-year storm events. Where
drainage is being calculated for a compacted gravel surface such as a parking lot, the
calculations shall reflect a paved surface so that future paving of the lot does not
significantly alter the drainage of the site.
Section 28. Utilities.
All utilities serving the development shall be installed underground. Waivers to this
requirement may be granted by the Planning Board on some portions of the site if it is
determined to be impractical due to the presence of ledge, wetlands or other
impediments.
Section 29. Landscaping.
Every lot shall comply with the following standards in order to: enhance site design;
enhance privacy; separate, screen and shield potentially conflicting land uses or abutters
from undue impact; reserve a portion of the lot to remain undeveloped, permeable, and
vegetated; control excessive storm water runoff; prevent soil erosion and pollution of
water bodies; reduce heat, glare and dust; not detract from the Town's aesthetic qualities;
and help integrate the built environment with the natural environment.
A. Buffer Areas. Every lot shall reserve a buffer area along and within its
perimeter boundaries in accordance with the following:
1. The buffer area shall be defined as that area within the front, sideline,
and back lot line setbacks as specified the Farmington Zoning
Ordinance;
2. The buffer area shall be vegetated and provide screening as required,
except for driveways and other features approved by the Board;
3. The buffer area shall not be used for merchandise display, vehicle
parking or storage, or any other use which conflicts with the purpose and
standards of this landscaping section;
4. Driveways shall cross the buffer areas at an angle of 90 degrees +/- 15
degrees to the perimeter boundary;
5. A buffer of at least twenty-five feet (25') shall be required for portions of
the development abutting existing residential property.
B. Greenspace. In all zoning districts, greenspace shall comprise no less than
25% of the total lot area.
Farmington Site Plan Review Regulations Amended May 6, 2014; March 29, 2016
27
C. Trees. The use of trees in the landscaping plan shall be required.
Preservation of existing trees are encouraged to the extent possible. Trees
located within buffer areas shall be preserved unless the need for removal
can be demonstrated. Where traffic control islands are used, pursuant to
Section 23, trees may be utilized for landscaping.
D. General Standards. The following general standards shall apply to all lots:
1. Landscaping shall not obstruct the line of sight, or create other hazards
for vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
2. Suitable vegetative ground cover shall be maintained to ensure soil
stability.
Section 30. General Appearance Criteria.
In order to “... provide for the harmonious and aesthetically pleasing development of the
municipality and its environs...” (RSA ?674:44II(b)), the Planning Board will use the
following criteria in its review of the architectural design of proposed commercial
structures.
The purpose of these guidelines is to provide design standards with which to assist with
the development, renovations and restorations of commercial properties to complement
the overall New England-style ambiance of the community. The guidelines are directed
towards, but not limited to, assisting corporate franchises and commercial developments
in the design of structures, and related properties, which reflect the small town, rural, and
agricultural atmosphere that is unique to Farmington.
The objective of these regulations is not intended to restrict imagination, innovation or
variety in the new construction, restoration and renovation of commercial buildings and
related property, but rather to enhance the visual appearance of the community, conserve
property values, and to further encourage continued economic development. These
regulations ARE intended to discourage routine franchise architecture, strip mall vistas,
etc.
These architectural design regulations do not apply to industrial buildings in an industrial
zone, however additional screening may be required for industrial buildings.
The regulations contained herein do not expect to foresee all possible proposed building
situations. Decisions concerning such unforeseen situations will be made with these
regulations in mind.
A. Factors for evaluation. The evaluation of the following appearance factors will
govern the Planning Board’s decisions on whether the proposed site and
building designs are acceptable.
1. Conformance to this section - General Appearance Criteria;
2. Architectural character;
Farmington Site Plan Review Regulations Amended May 6, 2014; March 29, 2016
28
3. Building materials and subdued color considerations;
4. Vehicular and pedestrian circulation and parking;
5. Harmony and compatibility of project compared to existing site and
neighborhood;
6. Lighting design;
7. Integration of landscaping and buffer areas; and
8. Retention, alteration, or removal of existing structures and site features;
B. Site Development. The development of the site must address various elements
in providing a total design plan for the proposed construction. The building’s
orientation, setback, alignment with the street, and relative spacing with respect
to other structures will be considered in the overall design. Long, strip-mall
type development should be avoided. “U-shaped”, “L-shaped”, etc.
structures are encouraged. The reuse of existing structures and landscape
features is encouraged. The overall architectural theme for the site
development will create a positive image for the project.
C. Site Organization. All existing natural and man-made features of the site
should be carefully considered for integration into the overall site design. It is
important to cluster buildings within a development wherever feasible to
encourage open space. A compact building arrangement provides savings in
grading, paving, utilities and other costs and conserves natural site features and
open space. Separation of vehicular and pedestrian pathways is important to
the overall safety of the site.
D. Architectural Requirements
1. Roofs: Monotony of design or warehouse style structures shall be avoided.
Variation in detail, form and siting shall be used to provide visual interest.
In order to prevent the construction of warehouse style buildings (i.e. long
horizontal roof lines), all new buildings and additions shall have pitched
roofs of 3:12 or greater, or gabled roofs, where practical. Shed, gambrel and
barn style roofs are also acceptable. Dormers are encouraged. Roofs must
have appropriate overhangs.
In large commercial structures over 200 feet in length where pitched roofs
are not practical, the use of false building fronts shall be used to imitate
pitched roofs to vary the horizontal lines along portions of the facade to
create the appearance of multiple attached buildings. Additionally, changes
in building elevations may be used in conjunction with pitched roofs to give
the appearance of multiple attached buildings.
All sides of a structure shall receive design consideration. A facade
unrelated to the rest of the building is not acceptable.
2. Building materials: Exterior surfaces of building shall be covered with
traditional materials or products which simulate natural materials, including
Farmington Site Plan Review Regulations Amended May 6, 2014; March 29, 2016
29
but not limited to clapboards, shingles, stone, brick, or architectural
CMU’s. Exposed plain cinder block, corrugated steel, sheet plastic or sheet
fiberglass are prohibited. Pitched roofs shall be constructed of shingles,
metal roofing or other materials traditionally used in this region.
3. Awnings: Awning covers designed for shade should be made of fabric or
simulated fabric-like material. The use of muted color tones is encouraged
for awning fabric.
4. Architectural details: Balconies, decks, covered porches, decorative
shingles, bracketed eaves, columns, balustrades, towers, turrets, skylights
and arches are among the details to be considered and encouraged. All
features and details should be in proportions with the building.
5. Windows and doors: Windows shall comprise no less than 5% of the
exterior wall surface of the portions of the building facing a public right-ofway,
parking area, or a developed area - on or off site. Windows may be
used for either interior illumination or for display purposes. All windows
and doorways shall be encased with trim; decorative trim is preferred. This
guideline can be waived if it is shown that the windows will serve no useful
function and will interfere with an otherwise acceptable architectural design
or are shown to present a safety hazard.
6. Fencing: Fences made of traditional New England materials are
encouraged. (i.e. picket, split rail, wrought iron, brick, stone). Chain link
security fences may be allowed where appropriate, but their use is generally
discouraged.
7. Lighting: Site lighting must conform to the specifications in these
Regulations, with no light spilling or reflecting onto adjacent properties.
8. Intercoms: Use of amplified PA or drive-thru type intercoms is prohibited if
the site abuts developable residential property or property in residential use
unless the applicant can demonstrate that no noise from these devices will
leave the confines of the site. Permissible amplified systems should be
designed using components that minimize the radiation of sound and use
noise blocking design techniques and site elements that prevent radiation of
noise (i.e. landscaping and fencing).
9. Color: Exterior colors of buildings and accessories are encouraged to be
muted. Bright colors are not acceptable.
10. Mechanical Equipment: All rooftop mechanical units shall be located so as
not to be visible from the street level or from other public areas on the
ground level. Wall or ground mounted equipment shall be screened from
public view with fences or vegetation.

Section 30.1. Business Node Overlay District Standards
A. Applicability
These standards shall apply to an application pursuant to the Route 11 Business Node
Overlay District. Where there is conflict between these standards and another section of
these Site Plan Regulations, the following standards shall apply.
B. Purpose
The purpose of this Section is to establish regulations that will, over time, help maintain
and restore the rural, small town character of the Town.
C. Parking and Landscape Standards
1. Access Management: Access must be designed in accordance with the Access
Management Section (3.20) of the Zoning Ordinance.
2. Parking
a. Off-street parking areas shall be connected to the buildings they serve by
raised (curb protected) pedestrian walkways.
b. Parking shall be provided in accordance with Section 21 of the Site Plan
Regulations.

2.1 Use of Public Sewers

A		It shall be unlawful for any person to place, deposit, or permit to be deposited in any unsanitary manner on public or private property within the Town of Farmington or in any area under the jurisdiction  of said Town, any human or animal excrement, garbage, or objectionable waste.

B,		It shall be unlawful to discharge to any natural outlet within the Town, or in any area under the jurisdiction of said Town, any wastewater or other polluted waters, except where suitable treatment has been provided in accordance with subsequent provisions of this Ordinance and with State and federal laws and regulations.

C	Sewers For Intended Uses Only. No person shall discharge into any public sewer of the Town, or into any fixture that thereafter discharges into any public sewer, any waste or substance other than for which the particular sewer is intended, designed or provided.

D,	Applicable Permits Required. No person shall discharge into any public sewer of the Town, or into any fixture  that thereafter discharges into any public sewer, any waste or substance until all applicable federal, state and local permits have been obtained.

E.	Use Of Sanitary Sewers. Except as specifically provided with reference to some particular sewer, sanitary sewers shall be used only for the conveyance and disposal of domestic wastewater, and for industrial wastes that are not objectionable as hereinafter provided.  No sanitary sewer shall be used to receive and convey or dispose of any storm or surface water, subsoil drainage, or unpolluted water.



F.	Use Of Storm Sewers. Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designed as storm sewers, or a natural outlet approved by the Superintendent. An NPDES permit is required prior to discharging industrial cooling water, process waters, or storm water runoff generated in areas of industrial activity (as defined in 40 CFR Part 122) to a storm sewer or natural outlet.

G.	Use Designation. If the intended or designated use of any particular sewer or drain and allowable discharge thereto is unclear, the Superintendent will consider the pertinent facts and make a determination.

H. Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be unlawful to construct or maintain any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool, or other facility intended or used for the disposal of wastewater in any area where a public sewer is available, as described in paragraph (I) below.

12.
 
I.		The owner(s) of all houses, buildings, or properties used for human occupancy, employment, recreation, or other purposes, situated within the Town and abutting on any street, alley, or right-of­ way in which there is now located or may in the future be located a public sanitary sewer of the Town, is hereby required at the owner(s)' expense to install suitable toilet facilities therein, and to connect such facilities directly with the proper public sewer in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance within ninety (90) days subsequent to the date of official notice to do so, provided that said gravity public sewer is within one hundred (100) feet of the building (RSA 147:8). This requirement for connection may be waived when permitted by the Superintendent with the approval of the Board of Selectmen if the household is already connected to a properly functioning, State­ approved septic system approved after 1985. All proposed sanitary sewer extensions shall be reviewed and approved by the Board of Selectmen before the owner( s) begin any formal application process.

J.		Where a public sanitary sewer is not available under the provisions of paragraph (I) above, the building sewer shall be connected to a private wastewater disposal system complying with the provisions of RSA 485-A:29-44 and rules promulgated thereto. The owner(s) shall operate and maintain the private wastewater disposal facilities in a sanitary manner at all times, at no expense to the Town. At no time shall any quantity of industrial waste be discharged to a private, domestic wastewater disposal facility.

K.	At such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property serviced by a private wastewater disposal system, the owner shall connect to the public sewer, as provided in paragraph (I) above. Any septic tanks, cesspools, and similar private wastewater disposal facilities shall be cleaned of sludge and filled with clean mineral soils, and their use shall be discontinued.

B.	There shall be two (2) classes of building sewer permits: (a) for residential and commercial service producing only domestic wastewater, and (b) for service to establishments producing industrial wastes. For residential and commercial services, the owner(s) or his agent shall make application on a special form furnished by the Town at least thirty (30) days prior to said service connection. For an establishment discharging industrial wastes, the application shall be made at least sixty (60) days prior to said service connection. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information (including pollution prevention studies) considered pertinent in the judgement of the Superintendent. A permit and inspection fee shall be paid to the Town at the time the application is filed.

13.
 
C.	All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection of the building sewer from the sanitary sewer to the building(s) shall be borne by the owner(s). The owner(s) shall indemnify the Town from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer or connection to the sanitary sewer. The owner(s) shall thereafter be obligated to pay all costs and expenses of operation, repair and maintenance, and of reconstruction if needed of the building sewer from the curb or the property line or the edge of a right-of-way to the building(s) served including the connection.

D.	A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building, except where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway. In such cases, the front building sewer may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer, but the Town does not and will not assume any obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any such single connection.

E.	Existing building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the Superintendent to meet all requirements of this Ordinance. All costs to examine and test the building sewer shall be paid for by the owner(s).

F.	The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the Town and DES rules Env-Ws 700. Inthe absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and Water Environment Federation (WEF) Manual of Practice No. FD-5 shall apply.

G.	During construction of a new sanitary sewer, the Town may construct that section of the building sewer  from  the sanitary  sewer to the curb  or the property  line or the edge of  a right-of-way. Construction of the building sewer from that point, including connection to the building(s) served, shall be the responsibility of the owner of the improved property to be connected; and such owner shall indemnify and save harmless the Town, its officers, and agents from all loss or damage that may result, directly or indirectly, due to the construction of a building sewer on his premises or its connection to the new sanitary sewer. The owner shall thereafter be obligated to pay all costs and expenses of operation, repair and maintenance, and of reconstruction, if needed of the building sewer from the curb or the property line or the edge of a right-of-way to the building(s) served including the connection.

H.	Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. Inall buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sewage conveyed by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer at the owner's expense.



I.		No person(s) shall make connection of roof downspouts, interior or exterior foundation drains, area­ way drains, sump pumps, or other sources of surface run-off or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain that  in tum is connected directly or indirectly to a public  sanitary sewer unless approved by the Superintendent and Board of Selectmen and deemed to be in the best interest of the Town.
14
 
J.	No person shall obstruct the free flow of air through any drain or soil pipe.


K.	The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the Town, or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and the WEF Manual of Practice No. FD-5. All such connections shall be made gas-tight and watertight and verified by proper testing. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.

L.	The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Superintendent when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. Such notice shall be provided not less than 48 hours in advance of the time any connection is to be made to any public sewer. The connection and testing shall be made under the supervision of the Superintendent or his representative. This requirement shall also apply to repairs or alterations to building com1ections, drains or pipes thereto.

M.	Suitable provisions shall be made at the point of connection for testing, which responsibility shall rest with the holder of the sewer connection permit.

N.	No building sewer shall be covered until it has been inspected and approved by the Superintendent or his representative. Ifany part of building sewer is covered before being inspected and approved, it shall be uncovered for inspection at the cost and expense of the owner of the improved property to be connected to the public sewer.

0.	The Superintendent shall maintain a record of all connections made to public sewers and drains under this Ordinance and all repairs and alterations made to building connections or drains connected to or discharging into public sewers and drains of the Town or intended to so discharge. All persons concerned shall assist the Superintendent in securing the data needed for such records.

P.	All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the Town at the expense of the owner.

Q.	Proposed new discharges from residential or commercial sources involving loadings exceeding 5000 gallons/day, any new industrial discharge, or any alteration in either flow or waste characteristics of existing industrial wastes that are being discharged into the POTW shall be approved by NHDES. Such approvals shall be obtained in accordance with Section 6.2 of this Ordinance.

2.3  Prohibited Discharge Standards


Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be accidentally discharged to the POTW.

A.	General Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater that causes pass-through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other federal, State, or local pretreatment standards or requirements.

22.	Waters or wastes that, by interaction with other water or wastes in the POTW, release dangerous or noxious gases, form suspended solids that affect the operation of the collection system, or create a condition deleterious to structures and treatment processes; or

23.	Any materials that exert or cause unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to, Fullers earth, lime, slurries, and lime residues) or of dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate).

2.4 Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards

The categorical pretreatment standards are found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471.


EPA shall be the Control Authority for industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards. As the Control Authority, industrial users are responsible to the EPA for compliance with categorical pretreatment standards and the requirements of 40 CFR Part 403. Categorical industrial users shall provide the Town with copies of any reports to, or correspondence with EPA relative to compliance with the categorical
17
 
pretreatment standards.


The industrial user is responsible for determining the applicability of categorical pretreatment standards. The industrial user may request that EPA provide written certification on whether the user is subject to the requirements of a particular category.

Upon promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this Ordinance for sources in that subcategory, shall, on the compliance date of the categorical pretreatment standards, immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this Ordinance.

2.5  Local Discharge Restrictions

All persons discharging industrial process wastes into public or private sewers connected to the Town's POTW shall comply with applicable federal requirements and State standards for pretreatment of wastes as they may be amended from time to time in addition to the requirements of this Ordinance.

Local numerical discharge limitations established by the Town as set forth herein, or may be added in the future (referred to as "local limits"), all State pretreatment standards and federal categorical pretreatment standards shall apply, whichever is most stringent.

In developing the list of pollutants of concern for which local limits are established, the Town has considered the allowable headworks loading at the wastewater treatment facility. Pollutants that exceed fifty percent (50%) of their allowable headworks loading at the wastewater treatment facility are considered to be of concern and have resulted in development of local limits.



If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the POTW that exceed the standards or restrictions established in Sections 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 of this Ordinance, which inthe judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon the POTW, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or that otherwise create a hazard to worker safety or health, or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:

Reject or prevent any discharge to the POTW after notice has been served to the discharger and the discharger has had reasonable opportunity to respond;

Require pretreatment prior to discharge to the POTW (Section 3.0);


Require control (e.g., equalization) over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or Require payment to cover additional cost of handling and treating the wastes.
If the Superintendent allows the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of
the systems and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent, Board of Selectmen, and NHDES. (see Section 3.0).
18
 

A.	Maximum Allowable POTW Head works Loadings Limitations.  The following numerical pollutant loading limitations are established to protect against pass-through and interference:









-"












The Superintendent shall calculate and administer daily concentration limits (i.e., local limits) when required as described below to ensure that the combined industrial pollutant discharge loadings do not cause or contribute to exceedences of these limitations. For industrial discharge applications, the local limits shall apply at the end of the process train prior to dilution with non-industrial wastewaters.

Daily concentrations are the concentration of a pollutant discharged, determined from the analysis of a flow-composited sample (or other sampling procedure approved by the Superintendent) representative of the discharge over the duration of a 24-hour day or industrial operating schedule of less than 24 hours.

All concentration limits for metals represent "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The Superintendent may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in accordance with Section 2.8, in place of the concentration-based  limitations.

Local limits are developed based on the identification of industrial users known to be discharging each pollutant (industrial contributory flow procedure). Unless specifically identified in an industrial discharge permit, an industrial user shall not discharge the locally limited pollutants at concentrations 20 percent greater than the background concentrations used for local limits development.



B.	Screening  Levels.	The following  pollutants  shall  not  be  discharged  to  the  POTW  exceeding concentrations listed below without approval of the Superintendent:
Municipality may develop and include list or include in specific discharge permits.
 
Screening levels are numerical values above which actions are initiated to evaluate, prevent or reduce adverse impacts due to flammability, chemical reactivity, organic/solids loadings, or worker health and safety.



If any of the screening levels are exceeded, repeat analysis shall be performed to verify compliance or noncompliance with that screening level. Ifnoncompliance is confirmed, then the industrial user shall be required, at the discretion of the Superintendent, to conduct an appropriate engineering evaluation to determine the potential impact of the discharge of this pollutant to the Town's POTW or alternatively, to develop a pollution prevention plan specifically addressing the pollutant that exceeds the screening level. This study or plan must be conducted under the supervision and approval of the Town. Should the evaluation indicate the impact to be unsatisfactory, the Industrial User shall reduce the pollutant concentration to a satisfactory level. If the evaluation supports development of an alternate site-specific limitation, then the screening level shall be adjusted and administered as a limit for the specific discharge.

C.		Special Agreements. No statement contained in this Section except for paragraphs 2.3(A), 2.3(B), and 2.4 shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the Town and any industrial user whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the Town for treatment provided that said agreements do not contravene any requirements of existing federal or State laws, and/or regulations promulgated thereunder, are compatible with any user charge system in effect, and do not waive applicable federal categorical pretreatment standards. Special agreement requests shall require submittal of a pollution prevention plan that specifically addresses the discharge for which a special agreement is requested. For pollutants with numerical local limits, the Town may allocate a percentage of its allowable industrial loadings for such special agreements.  Requests for special agreements that exceed this allocation will not be approved.



2.6 Town's Right of Revision


The discharge standards and requirements set forth in Sections 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 are established for the purpose of preventing discharges to the POTW that would harm the sewers, wastewater treatment process, or equipment; would have an adverse effect on the receiving stream; or would otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance.

To meet these objectives, the Superintendent may, from time to time, review and set more stringent standards or requirements than those established in Sections 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 if, in the Superintendent's opinion, such more stringent standards or requirements are necessary. At a minimum, this review will be performed at least once every five years. In forming this opinion, the Superintendent may give consideration to such factors as the quantity of waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment facility, degree of treatability at the wastewater treatment facility, pollution prevention activities, and other pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste or wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer shall not be exceeded without the approval of the Superintendent.

The Superintendent shall allow affected industrial users reasonable time to comply with any changes to the local limits. The conditions and schedule for compliance shall accompany the written notification of amended local limits.
 
2.7 Dilution

No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment  standard or requirement.   The Superintendent  may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

2.8  Mass-Based Limitations

Users implementing process changes may request that compliance be determined based on mass limitations in lieu of concentration limitations. Such mass-based limitations will be calculated from the permitted concentration-based limitations and flows, and shall be equivalent to or less than the mass discharge in effect at the time of the request. The intent of a mass-based limit is to encourage and allow pollution prevention and/or water conservation measures that might cause a facility to increase pollutant concentrations in its discharge even though the total mass of the pollutant discharged does not increase, and may in fact decrease. Decisions on granting requests for mass-based compliance limitations will be based on user-specific information and current operating conditions of the POTW, and will be at the discretion of the Superintendent. Implementation of mass-based limitations may not contravene any requirements of federal or State laws and/or regulations implemented thereunder, and may not waive applicable categorical pretreatment  standards.



SECTION 3 ·PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER

3.1	Pretreatment  Facilities

Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comp!y with this Ordinance and shall achieve compliance with all limits, prohibitions, and requirements set out in Sections 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 of this Ordinance within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or the Superintendent, whichever is more stringent. All facilities required to achieve and maintain compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Superintendent for review, and shall be acceptable to the Superintendent and the NHDES before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the Town under the provisions of this Ordinance.

3.2	Additional  Pretreatment Measures

A.	Whenever deemed necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this .Ordinance, the Superintendent may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage  wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary.

B.	The Superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow.  An Industrial Discharge Permit may be issued solely for flow equalization
21.
 
C.	Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided at the owner's expense when, in the judgement of the  Superintendent,  these  devices  are  necessary  for  the  preliminary  treatment  of  wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users.  All interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.   Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at their expense. The owner shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate  means of the captured materials and shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal, which shall be subject to periodic review by the Superintendent.  Any removal and hauling of the collected materials shall be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.

D.	Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter and alarm.

E.	Where pretreatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided or required for any waters or wastes, these devices shall be maintained continuously to ensure satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.

3.3 Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans


Initially and at least once every two (2) years there after, the Superintendent shall evaluate whether each significant indirect discharger needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The Superintendent shall require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the Superintendent may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:

A.	Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges;

B.	Description of stored chemicals;


C.	Procedures for immediately notifying the Superintendent of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by Section 6.6 of this Ordinance; and

D.	Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.




SECTION 4 ·INDUSTRIAL DISCHARGE PERMIT APPLICATION


4.1 Wastewater Characterization

When requested by the Superintendent, a user shall submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within sixty (60) days of the request. The Superintendent is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information.
22
 
4.2	Industrial Discharge Permit Requirement

32
 
be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the Town.

6.7  Sample Collection


A.		Except as indicated in Paragraph (B), below, the user shall collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the Superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to demonstrate compliance with instantaneous discharge limitations (e.g., screening levels established to protect worker health and safety). A single grab sample may also be used in place of a composite sample with approval of the Superintendent when:






The effluent is not discharged on a continuous basis (i.e., batch discharges of short duration), and only when the batch exhibits homogeneous characteristics (i.e., completely mixed) and the pollutant can be safely assumed to be uniformly dispersed;

Sampling a facility where a statistical relationship can be established between previous grab samples and composite data; and

The waste conditions are relatively constant (i.e., are completely mixed and homogeneous) over the period of the discharge.

B.		Samples for temperature, pH, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds shall be obtained using grab collection techniques.

6.8	Timing

Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports that are not mailed, the date of receipt of the report by the person designated in the Industrial Discharge Permit shall govern.

6.9	Record Keeping

Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Ordinance shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this Ordinance and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact location, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person( s) obtaining the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least five (5) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the Town, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Superintendent. Before destroying the records, the industrial user shall request and receive permission from the Town.
33
 
SECTION 7 - POWERS AND AUTHORITIES  OF INSPECTORS

7.1	Compliance Monitoring


The Town shall investigate all instances of noncompliance with the industrial pretreatment standards and requirements.

The Town shall, as necessary, sample and analyze the wastewater discharges of contributing users and conduct surveillance and inspection activities to identify, independently of information supplied by such users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with industrial pretreatment standards. The Town may sample any waste stream from any contributing user at such times as it deems necessary to check for compliance of pretreatment standards and  accuracy of the reported data. The Town may require the contributing user to provide split samples between their lab and a lab chosen by the Town.
Each contributing user shall be billed directly for costs incurred for analysis of its wastewater.

7.2	Right of Entry:  Inspection and Sampling

All industrial users discharging to the Town's POTW shall allow unrestricted access by Town, State and EPA personnel ("Inspector(s)") for the purpose of determining whether the user is complying with all requirements of this Ordinance and any Industrial Discharge Permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Inspector( s) ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.

A.	If a user has security measures in force that require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Inspector( s) will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.

B.	The Inspector(s) shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.

C.	The Inspector(s) may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary.  The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least annually to ensure accuracy.

D.	Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the Inspector(s) and shall not be replaced.  The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.

E.	Unreasonable delays in allowing the Inspector(s) access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this Ordinance.

E. The Inspector(s) is authorized to obtain information concerning industrial processes that have a bearing on the kind or source of discharge to the public sewer. The industrial user may request that the information in question not be disclosed to the public in accordance with Section 8 of this Ordinance.	The information in question shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this Ordinance, the NPDES permit, or
34
 
the pretreatment program. The burden of proof that information should be held confidential rests with the user. However, information regarding wastewater discharge by the user (flow, constituents, concentrations, and characteristics) shall be available to the public without restriction.

G.	While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in this Section, the Inspector(s) shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the user. The user shall be held harmless for injury or death to the Inspector(s), and the Town shall indemnify the user against loss or damage to its property by Town employees and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage asserted against the user and growing out of the monitoring activities, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the user to maintain safe conditions.

H.	The Inspector(s) shall be permitted to enter all private properties through which the Town holds a duly negotiated easement for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair, and maintenance of any portion of the POTW lying within said easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on said easement, shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement pertaining to the private property involved.

I.	The Superintendent and other duly appointed employees of the Town bearing proper credentials and identification shall inspect the premises of any consumer for leakage or other wastes of metered water upon the request of the consumer. Such a request may be required in writing by the Town. The Town shall not be held liable for any condition that may prevail or exist that is discovered by inspection of the Town.

7.3	Search Warrants

If the Superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this Ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the Town designed to verify compliance with this Ordinance or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Superintendent may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Rochester District Court.



SECTION 8 ·CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION/PUBLIC PARTICIPATION


8.1 Confidential Information

Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, Industrial Discharge Permit Applications, Industrial Discharge Permits, and monitoring programs, and from the Superintendent's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Superintendent, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report that might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person providing the report.  Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent
 
data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to
the public without restriction.


8.2 Public Participation

SECTION 12 ·AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS


12.1  Upset

A.	For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with pretreatment standards due to factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.

B.	An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (C), below, are met.

C.	A user who intends to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:

1.	An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;


2.	At the time being of the upset, the facility was operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and

3.	The user has submitted the following information to the Superintendent within twenty-four
(24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days):

a.	A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;


b.	The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the amount of time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and

c.	Action  being  implemented   and/or  planned  to  reduce,  eliminate,  and  prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.



C.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the
 
burden of proof.


E.	Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards.

F.	Users shall control all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.  This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

12.2	Prohibited  Discharge  Standards


A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 2.3(A) of this Ordinance or the specific prohibitions in Sections 2.3(B) of this Ordinance if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:

A.	A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or

B.		No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the Town was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

12.3	Bypass

A.	For the purposes of this section,


1.	"Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.

2.	"Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.

B.	A user may allow any bypass to occur that does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (C) and (D) of this section.

C.	1.	If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible.

2.	A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the amount of time it is expected to
 
continue; and steps implemented or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.

D.	1.	Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may initiate enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:

a.	Bypass was required to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;

b.	There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgement to prevent a bypass that occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and

c.	The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (C) of this section.


2.	The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, subsequent to considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (D)( 1) of this section.
