EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example,
137.02 indicates that the code number is 1, the chapter number is
137 (or the 37th chapter within code 1) and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example,
408.01 indicates that the code number is 4, the chapter number is
408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially odd numbered, thus
reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 541.061, 541.062 and 541.063
follow
541.06 and precede
541.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance or resolution number originally assigned to it
at that time, or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections
without histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are
or contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the 1971 Codified Ordinances of
Willoughby was either ordinances or resolutions previously enacted by City
Council, or new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the 1971
Codified Ordinances without any history indicate that such sections contain new
matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance. In the following table, the
disposition of all source material in the 1971 Willoughby Codified Ordinances

   101.04  REVIVOR, EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)    The repeal of a repealing provision of these Codified Ordinances does
not revive the provision originally repealed nor impair the effect of any
saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)    The re-enactment, amendment, or repeal of these Codified Ordinances
does not, except as provided in division (c) of this section:
(1)    Affect the prior operation of the provision or any prior action taken
thereunder. 
(2)    Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation, or liability
previously acquired, accrued, accorded, or incurred thereunder.
(3)    Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture, or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal.
(4)    Affect any investigation, proceeding, or remedy in respect of any
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture, or punishment; and the
investigation, proceeding, or remedy may be instituted, continued, or enforced,
and the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment imposed, as if the provision had not
been repealed or amended.
   (c)    If the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment for any offense is reduced
by a re- enactment or amendment of these Codified Ordinances, the penalty,
forfeiture, or punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according

(ORC 1.58)
   101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
section or an inclusive group of sections, or of divisions or subdivisions of a
section, such reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any provision

(ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
(c)    (1)    If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
(2)    If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings of
Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to be
harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the amendments
are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment prevails. The
fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an earlier amendment,
or fails to include language inserted by an earlier amendment, does not of
itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments are irreconcilable only
when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into simultaneous operation.

expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)

of Council may consider among other matters:
(1)    The object sought to be attained;
(2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
(3)    The legislative history;
(4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws upon the
same or similar subjects;
(5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
(6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEPARABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of these Codified Ordinances or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the section or
related sections which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application, and to this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   (a)    Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an

of Council.  Such meetings shall begin at 8:00 p.m. and continue until
adjourned.
   (2)    Special Meetings.  Upon written request of the Mayor, the President
of Council or any three members of Council, special meetings of Council may be
called. Written notice thereof shall be given by the Clerk of Council by
serving the same upon the Mayor and each member of Council personally, or by
leaving such notice at his usual place of residence at least twenty-four hours
before the time specified for such meeting. The Mayor and each member may waive
such notice, and any defect or irregularity in the service of such notice shall
be conclusively waived by attendance at such meeting. Only such matters as are
set forth in such notice shall be considered and acted upon.
   (3)    President of Council.  The President of Council or, in his absence,
the Vice President of Council, shall take the chair at the hour for the meeting
of Council and shall call Council to order. A quorum being present, Council
shall proceed with the order of business. A majority of all members elected or
appointed must be present to constitute a quorum to do business, but a smaller
number may adjourn from time to time and shall have the power to compel the
attendance of absent members.
   (4)    Vice President of Council.  The President of Council shall designate
a member of Council who shall perform the duties of such office in the absence
or disability of the President of Council during his term.

changed except with unanimous consent or suspension of the proceeding rule.
   (7)    Adjournment.  A motion to adjourn shall always be in order except
during roll call. When a motion is made to adjourn, it shall be in order for
the President of Council, before putting the question, to state any fact to
Council relating to conditions of the business of Council which would seem to
make it advisable or inadvisable to adjourn at that time.
   (8)    Preserving Order.  The President of Council shall at all times
preserve order and decorum. He shall decide questions of order, subject to an
appeal to Council by any member. No member shall speak more than once on such
appeal. Where procedural questions arise which are not provided for by general
law or by ordinance, Robert's Rules of Order, revised, shall govern. The
Director of Law shall serve as parliamentarian.
   (9)    Control of Council Chamber.  The President of Council shall have
direction and control of the Council Chamber in case of any disturbance or

perform the duties of the chair during any meeting at which the President of
Council is present.
   (11)    Committees.  The President of Council shall appoint all committees,
whether standing or special, and the Mayor and President of Council shall be

affirmative vote of five members of Council.
(Ord. 1970-103. Passed 10-6-70.)

   (14)    Special Committees.  Special committees for the consideration of
special measures or matters, or for the performance of special legislative
functions, may be appointed by the President of Council.
   (15)    Committee Quorum.  A majority of all members of a committee shall
constitute a quorum.
   (16)    Committee Meetings.  It shall be the duty of the Chairman to give
notice of all committee meetings. The affirmative vote of a majority of all
members constituting such committee shall be necessary to report any matter out
of committee or to make any recommendation with respect to any subject referred
to such committee. Three consecutive absences from committee meetings shall
operate to suspend the member from such committee, unless excused by the
remaining members thereof. All suspensions shall be reported to Council
forthwith. No committee or member thereof shall be permitted to incur any
expense without first receiving the consent of Council.
   (17)    General Committee.  Meetings of the General Committee or Committee
of the Whole may be called by the Chairman thereof at any regular meeting or at
any special meeting at which all members of Council are present, and such
announcement shall be deemed due notice.
   (18)    Members Desiring to Speak.  When any member of Council desires to
address such body, he shall address the chair and say "Mr. President". If the
President of Council desires to recognize the member, he shall announce the
member's name. In the event two members desire to speak at the same time, the
President of Council shall name the member who is to have the floor. No member
shall speak more than twice on the same question, except with permission of
Council. He shall confine himself to the question under discussion or debate
and shall avoid personalities. No member shall speak upon any one question,
ordinance or resolution more than a total of ten minutes at any meeting, unless
additional time is granted by a majority vote of Council upon motion.
   (19)    Transgression of Rules.  If any member, in speaking or otherwise,
transgresses the rules of Council, the President of Council shall call the
offending member to order. Any member may, by raising a point of order, call
the attention of the President of Council to such transgression and the point
of order shall be decided by the President of Council without debate.
   (20)    Reference to Committees.  Any matter brought to the attention of
Council may be referred by the President of Council to a standing or special
committee as will in his judgment and discretion be proper. All such matters
shall be investigated and a report made to Council as a whole within such time
as is fixed by the President of Council. A motion to discharge a committee of
further consideration of any matter referred to it shall be in order upon the
expiration of the time so fixed. Roll call shall be had on such motion and a
majority of the members of Council must vote favorably upon the motion before
the adoption thereof.
   (21)    Delivery of Proposed Legislation to Committee.  All legislation
prepared by the Department of Law shall be delivered to the members of the
proper committee within a reasonable time before the meeting of Council at
which such legislation shall be considered. Such committee shall review the
legislation and give its report with its recommendation at the meeting of the
General Committee or Committee of the Whole.
   (22)    Reading of Legislation.  All ordinances and resolutions may be read
by caption only rather than in their entirety provided every member of Council
has had delivered to him, prior to the time at which the meeting was called to
order, a copy of such legislation. In the event any member of Council has not
had such legislation so delivered to him then the same shall be read in its
entirety by the President of Council or by some other member of Council or of
the administration designated by the President. No ordinance or resolution
granting a franchise or creating a right or involving the expenditure of money
or the levying of any tax or for the purchase, lease, sale or transfer of
property or of a general or permanent nature shall be passed unless the same
has been read either by caption only or in its entirety on three different
days. Council may dispense with this rule by a vote of two-thirds of its
members by a separate vote on such suspension taken by "yea" or "yes" and "nay"
or "no" on each separate piece of legislation sought to be excluded from the
three readings rule. The Clerk shall enter such separate vote on the Journal or
Minute Books of Council together with the names of the members voting "yea" or
"yes" and those voting "nay" or "no". In the event a motion to suspend the rule
requiring three readings is passed prior to a vote being taken on the passage
or adoption of any legislation and an  amendment is offered and approved prior
to such final vote being taken, no further separate vote need be taken on
suspension of the rule as to three readings. In the event any legislation has
initially been introduced and read by caption only, then the reading of the
caption of such ordinance or resolution at any subsequent meeting held on any
subsequent day shall constitute a further reading of such ordinance or
resolution. Upon the third such reading of such ordinance or resolution the
same may then be passed or adopted upon the affirmative vote of any four
members of Council. In the event such ordinance or resolution contains an
emergency clause, but has not been preceded by a separate vote to declare the
same an emergency measure, then such ordinance or resolution shall not become
effective immediately upon its passage or adoption but rather at the earliest
period allowed by law. At any time any ordinance or resolution containing an
emergency clause is introduced, the introduction or reading of the same may be
followed by a combined motion to suspend the rule requiring three readings and
to declare the same an emergency and such motion can only be passed by the
concurrence of at least five members of Council.
   (23)    Sergeant at Arms.  At each regular or special meeting of Council,
the Chief of Police, or such officer or member of the Division of Police as he
shall designate, shall be in attendance and shall perform the duties ordinarily
performed by a sergeant at arms.
   (24)    Publication of Ordinances and Resolutions.  Public notice of passage
of its ordinances or adoption of its resolutions by Council shall be by title
or caption only, which shall be posted on the City website for two consecutive
weeks.  However, this rule shall not apply to ordinances and resolutions
required to be published in full by the mandatory provisions of the State
Constitution. Nor shall it apply when ordinances are revised, codified,
rearranged, published in book form and certified as correct by the Clerk of
Council. In the latter case, such publication in book form shall be a
sufficient publication. The ordinances so published, under appropriate titles,
chapters and sections, shall be held the same in law as though they had been
published in a newspaper. Such ordinances shall be made available for public
perusal in the office of the Clerk of Council, and Director of Finance.
   (25)    Posting of Ordinances and Resolutions.  In addition thereto, the
Clerk of Council shall cause an authenticated copy of each ordinance and
resolution passed or adopted by Council to be posted in a conspicuous place on
the first floor lobby of the Municipal Building for a period of one calendar
month following such passage or adoption. The certificate of the Clerk of
Council to the fact of such posting shall be conclusive evidence of the fact of
such posting and any defect, error or omission in or of such posting shall not
constitute any error in any proceeding involving such legislation. Such act of
posting shall be for the convenience of the public.
   (26)    Providing Copies of Agenda Legislation at Meetings.  At each regular
meeting of Council, solely as a convenience to and for the information of the
public, and not to affect the validity of any legislation, the Clerk of Council
shall, prior to the start of such meeting, cause to be posted outside the
Council meeting room a copy of each separate piece of legislation appearing in
the new legislation portion of the agenda for such meeting. Whenever possible
and if practicable, the Clerk shall, likewise, provide copies of legislation
appearing on the unfinished business portion of the agenda for such meeting.
   (27)    Public Improvements and Levying Assessments.  The procedure for
making public improvements and levying assessments therefor shall be in
accordance with the law of the State. Advertising for competitive bids and the
awarding of contracts shall be in accordance with the applicable laws of the
State.
   
   (28)    Seal of the City.  The Clerk of Council shall be custodian of the
seal of Council. In the center of such seal shall appear the Great Seal of the
State of Ohio, around which, reading clockwise, beginning at the lower left
side, shall appear the words "City of Willoughby, Ohio, Clerk of Council". An
impression of such seal shall be fixed to any documents required by law to bear
the seal of Council, on such other documents as the Clerk of Council may wish
to identify with such seal; any contracts, notes or bonds of the City which
seal shall be the same as that of the Council except that it shall read "Mayor
of the City of Willoughby, Ohio".
   (29)    Voting Roll Call.  The order of roll call for the purpose of voting
shall be changed for each regular meeting of Council by having the members of
Council rotate alphabetically in voting first, for that particular meeting.
   (30)    Addressing Council.  During the portion of the meeting at which
visitors are allowed to speak, no visitor may speak more than once nor for a
period of time longer than three minutes, or such longer period of time as may
be set by the President of Council, until every other member of the audience
has been afforded an opportunity to speak. Thereafter, any persons having
previously addressed Council may have a second opportunity to address Council
for an additional period of time not to exceed two minutes. Council, by the
vote of five of its members, may at any time suspend this rule.
(Ord. 1970-103. Passed 10-6-70.)
   111.02  CLERK.
   The office of Clerk of Council is hereby established, which officer shall be
chosen by a majority of the members of Council. The duties of the Clerk of
Council shall be to keep the journal of Council and its records and to perform
such other duties as may be required by ordinance or resolution.
(Res. 1952-1. Passed 1-2-52.)

an officer acting under the direction of and in the absence of the Clerk of
Council, and who, in the absence of the Clerk of Council, shall be empowered
and authorized to exercise all of the powers and obligated to perform all the
duties of the Clerk. The person serving as Deputy Clerk of Council shall be
appointed by a majority vote of the Council, shall serve at the pleasure of
Council and shall be paid such compensation as may be established by ordinance.

   111.05  PROCEDURE FOR SALE OF SURPLUS CITY REAL ESTATE.
   (a)    Whenever Council finds it necessary or in the best interest of the
City to sell real estate not needed for Municipal purposes, such proceedings
shall be governed generally by the provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapter 721, except
that prior to the authorization provided in Ohio R.C. 721.03, Council shall
authorize the Mayor to have an appraisal made of the property proposed to be
sold by a competent appraiser. Such appraisal, when returned, shall be filed
with Council. Council shall, if the City proposes to authorize such real estate
to be sold, enact an ordinance authorizing the advertisement of such real
estate for sale and such advertisement shall be as specified in Ohio R.C.
721.03, except that the bids, when received, shall be reported by the Mayor to
Council.
   (b)    Council shall then, at a regular or special meeting and within sixty
days from the date of receipt of the bids, elect either to sell the property to
the highest bidder or to withdraw the property from sale.
   (c)    In the event that Council authorizes the sale of the property
pursuant to subsection (b) hereof, the same shall be governed by Ohio R.C.
721.03.
   (d)    In the event that Council elects to withdraw the property from sale,
the same shall be determined by ordinance, and no future sale of such property
shall be authorized within a period of two years from the time of the election
to so withdraw such property without first proceeding under the provisions of
this section, subject to the condition that in the event the high bid in a
subsequent proceeding is lower than the high bid in the prior proceeding, then
the property must first be offered to be sold to the party or entity making the
high bid at the prior sale. If the high bidder at the prior sale elects to
purchase the property, then the same must be sold to such prior bidder. In all
events no property of the City may be sold other than for cash to be placed in
escrow in United States dollars.

CROSS REFERENCE

   115.01  PROGRAM ADOPTED.
   The affirmative action program, as provided in this chapter is hereby
adopted.
(Bill 1979-34. Passed 2-20-79.)
   115.02  OBJECTIVE.
   The objective of this chapter is to reaffirm a policy of affirmative action
to the employment, transfer and promotion of minority and of female candidates,
so as to meet both the obligations of the laws pertaining thereto, as well as
to meet the City's obligation and desire to be a good citizen.
(Bill 1979-34. Passed 2-20-79.)
   115.03  POLICY.
   This statement reaffirms the policy of the City of Willoughby to hire
employees without discrimination as to race, creed, color, sex, age, national
background, physical handicaps not detrimental to performance, general health,
gender identity or sexual orientation. All personnel actions including but not
necessarily restricted to, recruiting, employment, transfer and promotional
procedures, reductions in force, City-sponsored training, benefit programs,
social and recreational programs, shall be administered without regard to race,
creed, color, national background, sex or age, except where sex or age is a
bona fide occupational qualification, and to correct the effects of past
discrimination and to prevent present and future discrimination.
(Bill 1979-34. Passed 2-20-79; Ord. 2010-81.  Passed 7-13-10.)
   115.04  IMPLEMENTATION.
   Successful implementation of this policy requires placement of
responsibility, communication and auditing.
(a)    The Mayor has the responsibility of coordinating the administration of
this program throughout the City. Each department head has the responsibility
of counseling and assisting all levels of management within their respective
departments on matters relating to minority groups. Each department head shall
assist the department with its communications with community minority groups
and with problems relating to minority employees.
(b)    It is the responsibility of each director to prepare and submit to the
Mayor as requested by the Mayor, a program of affirmative action for each
appropriate organization unit under the supervision of such director.
   In "Affirmative Action Guidelines", issued as Order #4 by the Office of
Federal Contract Compliance on January 30, 1970, an "affirmative action
program" is defined as a set of specific and result-oriented procedures to
which a contractor commits himself to apply every good faith effort. The
objective of those procedures plus such efforts is equal employment
opportunity. Procedures without effort to make them work are meaningless; and
effort, undirected by specific and meaningful procedures, is inadequate. An
acceptable affirmative action program shall include an analysis of areas within
which the contractor is deficient in the utilization of minority groups and,
further, goals and timetables to which the contractor's good faith efforts
shall be directed to correct the deficiencies, thus to increase materially the
utilization of minorities at all levels and in all segments of his work force,
where deficiencies exist.
   Hence, to fully comply with Title VII of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Act of 1964, these statements for which each director is responsible shall
include; but not necessarily be limited to:
(1)    An in-depth analysis of the work force in his organization unit to
include:
A.    Ratio of minority employees to total employees in each job category.
B.    Identification of each area in which minorities are "underutilized". 
"Underutilization" is defined as having fewer minorities in a particular job
category than would reasonably be expected by their availability.
C.    Percentage of minority work force as compared with the total work force
in the immediate labor area.
D.    The general availability of minorities having requisite skills in the
immediate labor area.
E.    The availability of minorities having requisite skills in an area in
which the employer can reasonably recruit.
F.    The availability of promotable minority employees within the
organizational unit.
G.    Anticipated expansion, contraction and turnover of and in the work force.
H.    Availability of training, both internally and externally, which can be
reasonably used to make all job classes available to minority employees.
(2)    Goals, timetables an affirmative action commitments shall be detailed in
writing to correct deficiencies shown by the above analysis. Goals shall be
established which meet the criteria of attainability with the expenditure of
every good faith effort. Confirming data shall be maintained such as seniority
rosters, applicant flow data and application rejection ratios indicating
minority status.  Special attention shall be directed to the underutilization
of minorities in the following six categories; officials and managers,
professionals, technicians, sales workers, office clerical and skilled
craftsmen.
(3)    Records of all special recruiting efforts, sources utilized, and
activities with local community action groups shall be maintained and resumes
of  these actions submitted with each semi-annual report. Plans for continued 
and increased activities of this nature shall also be included. 
   (c)    It is the responsibility of each director, superintendent and
department head to communicate this policy to all employees with special
emphasis to those who make employment and personnel decisions. Every department
shall  continue to distribute information on this policy to all new employees
during  the indoctrination program.

purpose of the Residential Code of Ohio for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings

   173.17  FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION APPEALS.
   Any appeal brought as a result of Chapter
1322 "Flood Damage Prevention" shall proceed as a public hearing in accordance
with the following procedures:
   (a)   At the hearing, the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Board of Building Code Appeals requires. In considering such
appeal, the Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations,
all relevant factors, standards specified in Chapter
1322, and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   Te danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (b)   Variances shall only be issued based upon the following:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      Including but not limited to the following conditions:
      (6)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (7)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
 1322.05(d)(2)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (8)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

185.01  AUTHORITY TO LEVY TAX; PURPOSE OF TAX.
   (a)    To provide funds for the purposes of general municipal operations,
maintenance, new equipment, extension and enlargement of municipal services and
facilities and capital improvements, the City of Willoughby hereby levies an
annual municipal income tax on income, qualifying wages, commissions and other
compensation, and on net profits as hereinafter provided.
   (b)   (1)    The annual tax is levied at a rate of two percent (2%). The tax
is levied at a uniform rate on all persons residing in or earning or receiving
income in City.  The tax is levied on income, qualifying wages, commissions and
other compensation, and on net profits as hereinafter provided in Section
185.03 of this Chapter and other sections as they may apply.
      (2)     Intentionally left blank.
   (c)    The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this Chapter
185 are authorized by Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution.  The
tax is levied in accordance with, and is intended to be consistent with, the
provisions and limitations of Ohio Revised Code 718 (ORC 718).  This ordinance
does not repeal the existing sections of Chapter
185 for any taxable year beginning on or before December 31, 2015, but rather
amends Chapter
185, effective January 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after January 1,
2016.  For municipal taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2015,
the City shall continue to administer, audit and enforce the income tax of the
City under ORC 718 and ordinances and resolutions, and rules and regulations of
the City, as that chapter and those ordinances and rules and regulations
existed before January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 2015-133.  Passed 11-10-15.)
185.02  DEFINITIONS. 
   (a)    Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the use of the
term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall
control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.
   (b)    The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall
include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   (c)    As used in this chapter:
      (1)   "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as
a C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C
corporation under (c)(24)(D) of this division, means a C corporation's federal
taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         A.    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
         B.    Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (c)(1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion
of intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of property described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         C.   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
         D.   (i)    Except as provided in (c)(1)(D)(ii) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
              (ii)    Division (c)(1)(D)(i) of this section does not apply to
the extent the income or gain is income or gain described in Section 1245 or
1250 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         E.     Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction
in the computation of federal taxable income;
         F.    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
         G.    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under Section 4313.02
of the ORC;
         H.   (i)    Except as limited by divisions (c)(1)(H)(ii), (iii), and
(iv) of this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a
taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
            (ii)    No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (c)
(1)(H) of this section to offset qualifying wages.
            (iii)   (a)    For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020,
2021, or 2022, a person may not deduct more than fifty percent (50%) of the
amount of the deduction otherwise allowed by division (c)(1)(H)(i) of this
section.
                 (b)    For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a
person may deduct the full amount allowed by (c)(1)(H)(i) of this section.
            (iv)    Any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward deduction that
is available must be utilized before a taxpayer may deduct any amount pursuant
to (c)(1)(H) of this section.
            (v)    Nothing in division (c)(1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section
precludes a person from carrying forward, use with respect to any return filed
for a taxable year beginning after 2018, any amount of net operating loss that
was not fully utilized by operation of division (C)(1)(H)(iii)(a) of this
section. To the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully
utilized in one or more taxable years by operation of division (C)(1)(H)(iii)
(a) of this section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed
for a taxable year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation
described in division (C)(1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section shall apply to the
amount carried forward.
         I.    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (v)(3)(B) of
Section
185.05.
         J.   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (v)(3)(B) of Section
185.05.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made an election described in division (c)(48)(B) of this section, is not a
publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in division
(c)(24)(D) of this section, and is not an individual, the taxpayer shall
compute adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer
were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid
or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless
such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as
payment of interest under Section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United
States treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-
employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer,
amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts
paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
Nothing in division (c)(1) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
      (2)   A.    "Assessment" means a written finding by the Tax Administrator
that a person has underpaid municipal income tax, or owes penalty and interest,
or any combination of tax, penalty, or interest, to the municipal corporation
that commences the person's time limitation for making an appeal to the Board
of Tax Review pursuant to Section
185.21, and has "ASSESSMENT" written in all capital letters at the top of such
finding.

185.03  IMPOSITION OF TAX.
     The income tax levied by City at a rate of two percent (2%) is levied on
the Municipal Taxable Income of every person residing in and/or earning and/or
receiving income in City.
 
Individuals.
   (a)     For residents of the City, the income tax levied herein shall be on
all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. 
This is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
185.02 (c)(16)).
   (b)     For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (c)     For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal
Taxable Income" as defined in Section
185.02 (c)(21).  Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section
185.02 (c)(12).
Refundable credit for Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.
   (d)   (1)    As used in this division:
         A.    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.    "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation attributable
to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions from the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.  Full loss is sustained if no distribution of money and
property is made by the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The taxpayer
sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the taxpayer
receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   (i)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for
the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to the City with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            (ii)    If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the City each
year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         D.   "Refundable credit" means the amount of City income tax that was
paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (2)    If, in addition to the City, a taxpayer has paid tax to other
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the City
for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         A.    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         B.    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
Domicile.
   (e)   (1)   A.   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the City for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the City on
the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if the Tax
Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in the City

         B.   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (e)(1)(A) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the City
for all or part of the taxable year.
      (2)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled
in the City for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be considered
include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
         B.   The location at which the individual is registered to vote;

individual;
         F.   Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual regarding
the individual's residency;
         G.   The primary location at which the individual is employed.
         H.   The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual's dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
           I.   The number of contact periods the individual has with the City.
For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact period" with

   (f)    This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the City, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
City or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or telephone
company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter 5745 of
the ORC.
      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
         A.   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
185.04 (c);
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   A.   If the apportionment factors described in division (f)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the City, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
City may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of
the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one
or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
185.12 (a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)(A) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
185.12 (a).
         D.   Nothing in division (f)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (f)(1)(B) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         A.   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:

a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            (iii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (f) (3)(A) or (B) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)    For the purposes of division (f)(1)(C) of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
                   A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of
where title passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:
            (i)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from
a stock of goods located within the City.
            (ii)    The property is delivered within the City from a location
outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own

sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
         B.   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.

         E.   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal

of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the City's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the City or if the individual
taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the City.  The City
shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose
of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal
corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the City, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the City
to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of the City shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the City. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the City's income tax ordinance.

this section for the purposes of that division or division (f)(2) of this
section, the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios
the property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

185.04  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
 
Withholding provisions.
   (a)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the City shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the City.  Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
185.03 or division (b)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
185.01(b)(1) of this chapter.  An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that
the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively
pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit
of, the employee.
   
   (b)   (1)    Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the City the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         A.    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the City in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the City in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.
Payment under division (b)(1)(A) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the
last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         B.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)(A) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         C.   Intentionally left blank.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator.  A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the City as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)     Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         A.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City during the preceding calendar year;
         B.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         C   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         D.   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         E.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (c)(2)(A)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a

in the City if the employee performed such services in the City on 20 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the City. For the purposes of this division, "presumed

performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         B.   For the purposes of division (c)(2)(A) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf
of the employer in the City than in any other municipal corporation on that
day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (c)(2)(A) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)(B) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to the City for any subsequent days in that calendar
year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal
services performed in the City.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City under
division (c)(4)(A) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the City for
the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee
for personal services performed in the City.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the City and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
185.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
City, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the City.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable

185.05  ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (a)    An annual City income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every individual taxpayer eighteen (18) years of age or older and any taxpayer
that is not an individual for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is

      (1)     The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
185.04 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the City.
      (2)     Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for the City income
tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.  The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which

receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the City, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
ordinance/chapter.
   (b)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (c)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the City, the return or notice required of that individual shall be

conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or

   (d)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer.  The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in
the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation,
Ohio Form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other
documentation necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return.
An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section
electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing
to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies
after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of this
section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (g)   (1)    A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to the City . No remittance is
required if the net amount s due is ten dollars or less.

on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year.  The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the City.  No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City's income tax
return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return shall be the 15th
day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
         A.   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City's income tax return.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's City income tax return.  If the
request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the City
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a
City's income tax return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return
shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (g) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) prevail.
   (h)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City for a taxable
year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the City an
annual net profit return under division (f)(3) of this section, unless the
provisions of division (h)(3) apply.
      (3)   A.   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does
not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the City income tax ordinance for a
taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a tax return with the City
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(c)(1)(G) within the
City.
            (ii)   The person no longer provides services in the City and does
not expect to be subject to City income tax for the taxable year.
         B.   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the City.  The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the City, make any sales in the City or otherwise become subject to the
tax levied by the City during the taxable year.  If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the City for the taxable year, the affiant agrees
to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with City
income tax ordinance and rules and regulations.”  The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (h)(3)(B),
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return for the
taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that conflicts
with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit change.
   D.   Nothing in division (h)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (i)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (j)    Taxes withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section
185.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the City, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the City and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)    Each return required by the City to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (l)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter
and of the City's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (m)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the City's
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (n)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the City during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (o)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.  However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)     Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (o)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (p)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (n) and (o) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (p)(2)(A) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
           B.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (p)
(2)(A) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (p)(2)(A) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (q)    For each taxable year to which division (n), (o), or (p) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (o)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (r)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (s)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (s)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (s)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (s)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (s)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section 718.80 of the Revised Code is
terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code is
binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (t)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated City
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated City income tax
return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   
   (u)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated City income tax return in the
same manner as is required under the United States department of treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (v)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (v)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
185.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return shall
make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
185.02(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
Section
185.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
Section
185.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not
be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
Section
185.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City;
         B.    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)    Corporations filing a consolidated City income tax return shall make
the computations required under divisions (r) through (y) of Section
185.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)    Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the City may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   (a)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the City who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality.  Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due the City under this chapter. 
   (b)     The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the City who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants
a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (c)     If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the City for the

   (b)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200.00. For the purposes of
this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld for the City from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
           B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year;

185.05.
   (d)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
185.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year; provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City under Section
185.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 2015-133.  Passed 11-10-15.)
185.08  ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document. 
(Ord. 2015-133.  Passed 11-10-15.)
185.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (a)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
185.18.
   (b)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (c)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (c)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
185.21.
   (d)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
185.18 (a)(4).
(Ord. 2015-133.  Passed 11-10-15.)
185.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (a)    Income tax that has been deposited with the City, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund
but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (b)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality, but should
have been deposited with the City, is subject to recovery by the City.  If the
City's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the City shall allow
a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
 
   (c)    If the City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City's tax rate.  However, if the City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (d)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-133.  Passed 11-10-15.)
185.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
City. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         A.    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
185.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (d) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
185.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's the City's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City
income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars. 
(Ord. 2015-133.  Passed 11-10-15.)
185.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)(A) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
185.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the local board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (b)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
185.09.
   (d)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
185.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (e) of Section
185.09.
   (e)    No civil action to recover the City income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-133.  Passed 11-10-15.)
185.13  AUDITS.
   (a)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax.  At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer.  A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (d)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest 
(Ord. 2015-133.  Passed 11-10-15.)
185.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         B.    Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(c)(1)(A) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)(1)(A) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City official,
or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division prevents
the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with
the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the local
board of tax review.
   (e)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)(B) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-133.  Passed 11-10-15.)
185.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City that arises pursuant to the City's income tax imposed in accordance
with this chapter.
   (b)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (d)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-133.  Passed 11-10-15.)
185.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)    This section does not prohibit the City from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-133.  Passed 11-10-15.)
185.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City ordinance or state law to
be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the City or the Tax Administrator.

      (5)    "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation,
schedule, and other document required to be filed with a the Tax Administrator

years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         B.   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required to
be paid or remitted to the City on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the City to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (c)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

185.19  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (a)     Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the

that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized

for the income tax levied by the City or for the withholding of such tax.

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

185.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
185.99.
         B.   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (c) of Section
185.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
185.18.
         C.   The penalties provided for under divisions (c)(2)(A) and (B) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
185.99 for a violation of Section
185.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

   193.03  ADMISSIONS EXEMPT FROM TAX.

the proceeds of which inure:
(a)    Exclusively to the benefit of religious, educational or charitable
institutions, societies or organizations, societies or organizations for the
prevention of cruelty to children or animals or societies or organizations
conducted for the sole purpose of maintaining symphony orchestras and receiving
substantial support from voluntary contributions, or of improving any municipal

benefit of any private stockholder or individual.
(b)    Exclusively to the benefit of persons in the military or naval forces of
the United States or of National Guard organizations, reserve officer
associations or posts or organizations of war veterans, or auxiliary units or
societies of any such posts, organizations, units or societies organized in the

forty-one cents (41¢) or    more; nor shall it be allowed in case of admissions
to wrestling matches, prize fights or boxing, sparring or other pugilistic
matches or exhibitions, unless  exclusively for the benefit of those

   Immediately after the event for which an exemption from the admission tax
has  been allowed, the treasurer of the institution, society or organization
for whose benefit such event was held shall file an itemized statement with the
Finance Director, setting forth the amount of money actually received by such
treasurer, together with the expenses of promoting and conducting such event.
Such statement shall be used as a basis of subsequent requests for exemption
from the admissions tax for the benefit of such institution, society or

promoting and conducting the event in relation to the profits, if any, no such
exemption shall thereafter be allowed to such institution, society or
organization.
   The exemption from tax provided in this section shall not be allowed to any
institution, society or organization which does not control the sale of
admissions to the event for which the exemption is requested, nor shall any
exemption be  allowed where talent, services or other items are compensated for
on a percent age basis if such percentage results in a payment in excess of the
flat rates ordinarily charged for the same talent, services or other items.

deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until
paid to the Finance Director as herein provided. Any person required to collect
the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the same or, having
collected the same, fails to remit the same to the Finance Director in the
manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of his
own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control, shall
nevertheless be personally liable to the City for the amount of such tax and,
unless the remittance is made as herein required, shall be guilty of a
violation of this chapter. The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the
time the admission charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any place
and shall be reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the
Finance Director in monthly installments and remittances therefor on or before
the thirtieth day of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in
which the tax is collected or received. Payment or remittance of the tax
collected may be made by check, unless payment or remittance is otherwise
required by the Finance Director, but payment by check shall not relieve the

a return upon such forms and set forth such information as the Finance Director

accounts of any person collecting a tax herein levied as to admission charges
and tax collections shall be subject to examination and audit at all reasonable

building, lots or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section
193.04 by such owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting

shall furnish, with the application therefor, the name and address of the
owner, lessee or custodian of the premises upon which the amusement is to be
conducted, and the owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the Finance
Director of the issuance of such Certificate and the joint liability for
collection and remittance of such tax.
(Ord. 1951-18. Passed 4-9-51.)

inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing the

   195.04  TRANSIENT GUESTS.

(Ord. 1971-39. Passed 3-16-71.)
   195.05  VENDOR.
   "Vendor" means the person who is the owner or operator of the hotel and who
furnishes the lodging.
(Ord. 1971-39. Passed 3-16-71.)
   195.06  PURPOSE, RATE AND APPLICATION OF TAX.
   There is hereby levied an excise tax on transactions by which lodging by a
hotel is or is to be furnished to transient guests of three percent of the
amount paid or to be paid by the transient guests for the lodging for the
purpose of providing revenue with which to help meet the needs of the City.
   Such tax shall be known as the transient guest tax. This tax applies and is
collectible at the time the lodging is furnished, regardless of the time when
the price is paid. The tax does not apply to lodging furnished to the State or
any of its political subdivisions.
   For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to prevent
the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by hotels in
the City to transient guests is subject to the tax until the contrary is
established.
(Ord. 1971-39. Passed 3-16-71.)
   195.07  TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY THE TAX.
   The transient guest tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the
transient guest to the vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient
guest the full and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging. The
tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be deemed to be held in
trust by the vendor until paid to the Administrator, as provided in Section
195.09. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the vendor, the
Administrator may require that such tax be paid directly to the Administrator.
   No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time
rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the
Administrator.
(Ord. 1971-39. Passed 3-16-71.)
   195.08  RECORDS; ADVERTISING.
   The transient guest tax shall be stated and charged separately from the
charge for the lodging and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time
the occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every
evidence of occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for such
occupancy issued or delivered by the vendor.
   No vendor shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or
indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the
vendor, or that it will not be added to the amount charged for the lodging, or
that, if added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 1971-39. Passed 3-16-71.)
   195.09  RETURNS REQUIRED.
   Each vendor shall, on or before the last day of the month, make and file a
return for the preceding month on forms prescribed by the Administrator,
showing the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax due from the
vendor to the City for the period covered by the return and such other
information as the Administrator deems necessary for the proper administration
of this chapter. The Administrator may extend the time for making and filing
returns. Returns shall be filed by delivering or mailing the same to the
Administrator together with payment of the full amount of the tax shown to be
due thereon.
   The Administrator may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not such as
to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Administrator upon the basis of
administrative costs of the City, to make and file returns at less frequent
intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate the
intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   All claims for exemption from the tax filed by transient guests with the
vendor during the reporting period shall be filed with the return.
   All returns and payments submitted by each vendor shall be treated as
confidential by  the Administrator and shall not be released by him except upon
order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the
United States, the State of Ohio, the County of Lake, or the City of
Willoughby, for official use only.
   The Administrator, if he deems it necessary in order to insure the payment
of the tax imposed by this chapter, may require returns and payments to be made
for other than monthly periods. The returns shall be signed by the vendor or
his authorized agent.
(Ord. 1971-39. Passed 3-16-71.)
   195.10  REFUNDS.
   The Administrator shall refund or grant credits to vendors for the amount of
taxes paid illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous
assessment where the vendor had not reimbursed himself from the transient
guest. A transient guest may obtain a refund or credit for the amount of taxes
paid illegally or erroneously, but only when the tax was paid by the transient
guest directly to the Administrator. No refund shall be paid unless the
claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement
thereto and makes a claim in writing on forms furnished by the Administrator,
stating under penalty of perjury the  specific grounds upon which the claim is
founded. Such claim shall be filed with the Administrator within three years of
the date of payment.
(Ord. 1971-39. Passed 3-16-71.)
   195.11  FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX.
   If any vendor fails or refuses to collect the transient guest tax or to file
a return and to make a remittance of such tax or any portion thereof, as
required by this chapter, the Administrator shall proceed in such manner as he
may deem best to obtain information on which to base his estimate of the tax
due. When the Administrator has such information as he is able to obtain upon
which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by
any vendor who has failed or refused to collect the same or to file a return
and to make a remittance of the proper amount thereof, he shall proceed to
determine and assess against such vendor the tax and penalty provided for in
this chapter.
   In case such determination is made, the Administrator shall give notice of
the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by registered or certified
mail. Such vendor may, within ten days after the serving or mailing of such
notice, make application in writing to the Administrator for a hearing on the
amount assessed. If application by the vendor is not made within the time
prescribed, the tax and penalty determined by the Administrator shall become
final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is
made, the Administrator shall give not less than five days written notice in
the manner prescribed in this section to the vendor to show cause at a time and
place fixed in such notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed
for such tax and penalty. At any such hearing, the vendor may appear and offer
evidence why such specified tax and penalty should not be so fixed. After such
hearing, the Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and
shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in
this section of such determination and the amount of such tax and penalty. The
amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days.
(Ord. 1971-39. Passed 3-16-71.)
   195.12  APPEALS.

deemed a debt owed by the vendor to the City. Any person owing money to the
City under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought
in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 1971-39. Passed 3-16-71.)
   195.14  RULES AND REGULATIONS.

inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing the
payment, collection and remittance of the transient guest tax.

transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient
guests as referred to and authorized by Ohio R.C. 5739.02(C). Accordingly, this
chapter shall be construed to effectuate that purpose so as to be consistent
with any requirement of law compliance with which is a prerequisite to the
validity of the tax intended to be levied hereby.
(Ord. 1971-39. Passed 3-16-71.)
   195.16  SEVERABILITY.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
as specified herein, is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part and shall not affect or impair any of the remaining
provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other parts of this chapter. It is
hereby declared to be the intention of Council that this chapter would have
been adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause,
section or part thereof not been included herein.
(Ord. 1971-39. Passed 3-16-71.)

the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten percent of the amount of the
tax in addition to the tax.

      (10)   When any vehicle is found standing or parked in violation of the
provisions of these Codified Ordinances, and such vehicle has two or more

         (Ord. 1991-197. Passed 11-19-91; Ord. 1996-78. Passed 4-2-96.)
      (11)   When any vehicle is found standing in a fire lane; or

for any reason, a charge for each day or fraction in excess of twenty-four
hours shall be made for the storage of such vehicle at the rate provided for
storage of vehicles in the current agreement between the City and the towing
service. There shall be no storage charge for any vehicle retrieved within the
first four hours of storage. No fee for storage shall be charged if the reason
for such storage was for special police purposes such as examinations or
investigations.
(Ord. 1987-85. Passed 5-5-87.)
   405.03  REDEMPTION; BOND; HEARING; TRIAL.
   (a)   With the exception of vehicles used during the commission of a crime,
excluding parking violations, the owner or other person lawfully entitled to
possession of an impounded vehicle shall have the following three options with
respect to such vehicle:
(1)   The owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession of such vehicle
shall pay a towing charge which shall be in conformance with the towing
company's current agreement with the City, all outstanding fines for violating
provisions of this Traffic Code, and a storage fee pursuant to Section
405.02. Upon such payment, the vehicle shall be released.
(2)   The owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession of such vehicle
shall furnish a cash bond in an amount as set by rule of the Willoughby
Municipal Court. Such bond shall be upon condition that the owner or other
person appear in the Court to answer the violation which caused the vehicle to
be impounded. The date for such appearance shall be scheduled when the bond is
posted. Upon the posting of such bond, the vehicle shall be released.
(3)   The owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession of such vehicle
shall request a probable cause hearing. The hearing shall take place on the day
after the owner or other person has given written notice to the Police
Department of his intention to challenge the towing. If, however, such day is a
Saturday, Sunday or  legal holiday, the hearing shall be held on the next day
which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.  The hearing shall be held
before the Judge of the Willoughby Municipal Court. The scope of the hearing
shall be confined to the issue of whether there was probable cause to believe
the vehicle was possessed, used, or parked in violation of law at the time of
towing. The Court shall receive into evidence the Police Department's dispatch
card on the vehicle, or the traffic citation or notice which led to the
impoundment of the vehicle. The Court shall also receive into evidence any
computer printout or teletype used, collected, produced or received by the
Department from any other law enforcement agency. The admission into evidence
of the dispatch card or traffic citation or notice, and the computer printout
or teletype shall constitute a prima facie showing of probable cause.
Additional evidence, however, may be offered by the City. The owner or other
person lawfully entitled to possession of the vehicle may offer evidence at the
conclusion of the City's case, which may be followed by rebuttal. The hearing
shall be conducted under the rules of evidence prevailing in criminal trials
generally. Upon conclusion of all the evidence, the Court shall do one of the
following:
A.   Find that there was no probable cause to believe that the vehicle was
towed for a violation of law at the time of towing, in which case the vehicle
shall be released without charge.
B.   Find that there was probable cause to believe that the vehicle was towed
for a violation of law at the time of towing, in which case the vehicle shall
be held pending trial on the traffic citation. The trial on the merits of the
traffic citation shall be scheduled upon a finding of probable cause. However,
the owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession of the vehicle may
furnish a bond as provided in subsection (a)(2) hereof, and claim the vehicle
pending trial.
   (b)   If, at the trial on the merits of the traffic citation, the Court
finds the defendant not guilty, the vehicle, if impounded, shall be released
without charge to the owner, and the City shall pay any towing and/or storage
costs. If the Court finds the defendant guilty, the Court shall, in addition to
court costs and any sentence on the traffic citation, impose a fine consisting
of the towing and impound charges established pursuant to this chapter. The
fine comprised of the towing, impound and storage fees is mandatory, and the
Court shall not suspend any part of such fine. Upon the payment of all of the
foregoing sums, the vehicle shall be released.
   (c)   No vehicle shall be released pursuant to this section unless the
person claiming ownership or lawful possession produces proof of identity and
ownership.
   (d)   Unless otherwise ordered by a court of law, vehicles shall only be
released during normal release hours as determined by the towing and storage
agency.
(Ord. 1987-85. Passed 5-5-87.)
   405.04  IMPOUND RECORDS.

impounded, license plate numbers, and the nature and circumstances of all such
violations, as well as the disposition of each case. The Department shall
notify the owner of any towed vehicle by certified mail sent to the last known
address of such owner. The Clerk of the Court shall account for all fees
collected under this chapter and pay the same into the City treasury.

   406.06  CONSTRUCTION ZONE.
   (a)   Definitions.
      (1)   “Construction zone” means that lane or portion of street or highway
open to vehicular traffic and adjacent to a lane, berm, or shoulder of a street
or highway within which lane, berm or shoulder construction, reconstruction,
resurfacing or any other work of a repair or maintenance nature, including
public utility work, is being conducted, commencing with the point where the
first worker or piece of equipment is located and ending where the last worker
or piece of equipment is located.
      (2)   “Reckless operation offense” and “speeding offense” have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 2903.06.
   (b)   Signs as to Increased Penalties in Construction Zones.  The Safety
Director may establish speed limits within construction zones that vary based
on the type of work being conducted, the time of day, or any other criteria the
Director may consider appropriate.  The Director shall cause signs to be
erected advising motorists that increased penalties apply for certain traffic
violations occurring on streets or highways in a construction zone.  The
increased penalties shall be effective only when signs are erected in
accordance with the guidelines and design specifications established by the
Director and when a violation occurs during hours of actual work within the
construction zone.
   (c)   Increased Penalties for Traffic Violations in Construction Zones.  The
rules required under subsection (b) hereof shall include guidelines to
determine which areas are appropriate to the posting of such signs.  The
guidelines may include consideration of the following:  the duration of the
work on the street or highway, the proximity of workers to moving traffic, the
existence of any unusual or hazardous conditions, the volume of traffic on the
street or highway, and any other appropriate factors.  The Director shall
formulate design specifications for the signs described in subsection (b)
hereof advising motorists of the increased penalties and notifying motorists of
the prohibitions set forth in Ohio R.C. 2903.06 and 2903.08 regarding the death
of or injury to any person in a construction zone as a proximate result of a
reckless operation offense or speeding offense as described in that division. 
For purposes of traffic violation penalties, nothing in this section is
intended to conflict with any standard set forth in the federal manual of
uniform traffic control devices for streets and highways.

   414.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
   414.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
414.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.

vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield

applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. 
            (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.

offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided

and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
 408.01, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years.  The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13.  (ORC 4511.19)

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that

the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender must
display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in

      (5)   If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order of criminal
forfeiture under this section is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or

The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under
Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13.  The court may grant unlimited driving
privileges with an ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may
reduce the period of suspension as authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.  If the

R.C. 2929.28, in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s indigent drivers’ alcohol

any aspect of the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay
the operation of the suspension.
   (m)   Subsection (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled

   (o)   Conflict of Terms.  All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to

subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider
whether the evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.

jurisdiction recognized by the State of Ohio.  No person shall be permitted to
have more than one valid license at any time. 
(ORC 4507.02)
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever

offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.  The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case.  If, within three years of the

in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not
be used for the purpose of determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or
(d) of this section has been or is being committed.

occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).
      (2)   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty
to a violation of subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section or of a state

   440.01  LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
(1)   The Municipality, with respect to highways under its jurisdiction, upon
application in writing and for good cause shown, may issue a special permit in
writing authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or combination
of vehicles of a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, upon any highway under its
jurisdiction.
(2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a special
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may
move the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the special permit on
any highway that is a part of the State highway system when the movement is
partly within and partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality.  No
local authority shall require any other permit or license or charge any license
fee or other charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a
vehicle or combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the State
highway system.  The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the
holder of a permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for
the movement of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the
jurisdiction of the Municipality.  Permits may be issued for any period of time
not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines
advisable or for the duration of any public construction project.
(3)   The application for a permit shall be in the form that the Municipality
prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe a permit fee to be imposed and
collected when any permit described in this section is issued.  The permit fee
may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse the Municipality for the
administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit, and also to cover the cost
of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway or a street or highway
structure as the result of the operation of the nonconforming vehicle or
combination of vehicles.  For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted
by the Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is
deemed a nondivisible load.
(4)   The Municipality may issue or withhold a permit.  If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure.  In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
(5)   Every permit shall be carried in the vehicle or combination of vehicles
to which it refers and shall be open to inspection by any police officer or
authorized agent of any authority granting the permit.  No person shall violate
any of the terms of a permit.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Local Streets.  No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified in Section
440.02 or exceeding a gross weight of five tons, upon any street in the;
Municipality other than a State route, except those local streets designated as
a truck route and marked as such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when
such operation is necessary to load or unload property, to go to or from the
usual place of storage of such vehicle or to perform any other legitimate
business or act other than passage through the Municipality.
   (c)   Local Permit and Conditions.  Upon application and for good cause, the
Mayor may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an oversize or
overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets and highways.
   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the Ohio
Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination of
vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the approval
of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement upon
State routes as provided in subsection (a) hereof.
   The Mayor may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or for such period
of time, not to exceed one year, as the Mayor in his discretion deems
advisable, or for the duration of any construction project. The Mayor may limit
or prescribe terms or conditions of operation for such vehicle or combination
of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed or such other restrictions
as may be necessary for the preservation of the public peace, property, health
and safety. The Mayor may require the posting of bond or other security
necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or road structure.
   For each such permit, the Mayor shall charge ten dollars ($10.00), and for
each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the Division of Police in
supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay the sum of
five dollars ($5.00).
   Streets or highways under local jurisdiction shall be posted with signs
indicating "no thru trucks - gross weight 5 tons" or words of similar import to
apprise drivers of the limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall
disobey the instructions indicated on any such sign.
   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the permit
granted by the Mayor shall be cause for immediate revocation or suspension of
such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such violation shall
also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by Sections
408.01 and
408.02.
(Ord. 1971-123. Passed 7-13-71.)

(Ord. 1966-35. Passed 3-14-66. )
   (e)   Weight Reduction During Thaws and Moisture. When thaws, excessive
moisture or the nature of the road bed, construction and other factors which
are material to the proper preservation and maintenance of the roads, streets
or highways render them insufficient to bear the traffic thereon, or when such
streets, roads or highways would be damaged or destroyed by the type or nature
of the usual traffic thereon, the maximum weight of the vehicles and/or load
shall be reduced as prescribed by the Director of Public Service as the type,
nature and condition of such street, road or highway justifies. At least one
day before such reduction becomes effective the Director of Public Service
shall cause to be placed and retained on such streets, roads or highways, at
both ends and at points of intersection by other streets, roads or highways,
during the period of such reduced limitation of weight, signs of substantial
construction, which will conspicuously indicate the limitation of weight and/or
load which is allowed thereon and the date on which such limitation shall go
into effect.
   A record of the action of the Director of Public Service with respect
thereto shall be kept in his office. No person shall operate upon any such
road, street or highway, any vehicle whose maximum weight is in excess of the
limitations prescribed by the Director of Public Service.
   The provisions of this section shall not apply to fire trucks or other
vehicle of any fire department of any political subdivision.

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.  Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible

network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same

   501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09  ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted.  In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Section
513.01 or Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
   501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
(1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
(2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
(3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio R.C.
2923.01;
(4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09 or Ohio R.C. 2923.02.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in
Section
501.11 or Ohio R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such
organization, if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of the offense, and any of the following apply:
(1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has direct
responsibility;
(2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.

   501.13  USE OF WEAPONS IN COMMISSION OF OFFENSE.
   (a)   Notwithstanding any other provision of these Codified Ordinances, no

   501.14  COSTS OF CONFINEMENT; REIMBURSEMENT.
   (a)   Any person convicted of an offense other than a minor misdemeanor
originating in the City who is or was in the custody of the City's Police
Department or was confined in the City or County jail or any facility for which
the City is charged any expense, shall reimburse the City for the City's
expenses incurred by reason of such person's custody or confinement, including,
but not limited to, the expenses relating to the provision of food, clothing,
and shelter and medical, dental, and psychiatric care or treatment. The amount
of reimbursement shall be determined by a court at a hearing held pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.28.  However, the maximum amount permitted by Ohio R.C. 2929.28
shall not apply. The amount shall be included as costs as defined by and
provided in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
   (b)   The Chief of Police and/or the Director of Finance shall maintain

   501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).(A.O.)
         F.   For a specifically classified minor misdemeanor, not more than
five hundred dollars ($500.00). 
(Ord. 2006-124.  Passed 9-5-06.)
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender's term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender's participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.   Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5,000.00

      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available

particular shipment of livestock, which written request shall be separate and

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

purpose;

   541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02:
(1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
(2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this section, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
(3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this section, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property       fixtures,
is the difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before
and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, “fair market value” has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02 or Ohio R.C. 2913.61.
   (c)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02 or Ohio R.C. 2913.61(D), may be used to establish the value of property
pursuant to this section.

offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an

 545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
 545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section

active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section

may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.

property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,

worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.

materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
 
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)
   545.03  PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.

that involves a firearm other than a handgun.
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (a) of
improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle that the actor transported or
had the firearm in the motor vehicle for any lawful purpose and while the motor

has pleaded guilty to a violation of subsection (b) of this section as it
existed prior to  September 30, 2011, and if the conduct that was the basis of
the violation no longer would be a violation of subsection (b) of this section
on or after September 30, 2011, the person may file an application under Ohio
R.C. 2953.37 requesting the expungement of the record of conviction.

section or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise
prohibited by law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is not
contraband, the officer shall return the firearm to the person at the

Director of Public Safety, or his designate. Five or more false alarms annually
shall also be grounds for cancellation of the permit by the Director of Public
Safety.
   (c)    If there is a response by the Police or Fire Department to a false
alarm resulting from improper equipment, installation and/or servicing by the

($100.00) per false alarm in addition to the amounts in subsection (a) hereof.

standard approved by the Chief Building and Zoning Inspector. The applicants
may be required to submit evidence of the reliability and suitability of the
equipment to be installed before a permit may be issued or thereafter.
   (b)    The sensory mechanism used in connection with such devices shall be
adjusted to suppress false indications of fire or smoke, or intrusion so that
the devices shall not be actuated by impulses due to transient pressure change
in water pipes, short flashes of light, wind noises such as the rattling or
vibrating of doors or windows, vehicular noise adjacent to the installation or
other forces unrelated to genuine alarms
   (c)    All components comprising such a device shall be maintained by the
owner, lessee and/or user in good repair to assure reliability of operation.
   (d)    Each alarm equipment supplier that sells or leases an automatic
protection device which is installed on any premises in the City shall furnish
instructions for the operation and maintenance of such device to the purchaser
or lessee.
   (e)    Each alarm equipment supplier shall also furnish to the Chief
Building and Zoning Inspector a copy of the instructions as to the way the
device operates. In the event the Chief Building and Zoning Inspector finds
such instructions to be incomplete, unclear or otherwise inadequate, he may
require the alarm equipment supplier to have the same revised to meet his
approval and then promptly have copies distributed by such supplier to persons
for whom installations of such devices are made.
   (f)    Each alarm equipment supplier that sells or leases an alarm system
with an automatic dialer for which a permit is required, shall provide for
receiving calls for service, directly or through an agent, on a twenty-four
hour basis, seven days a week, and shall respond to such calls within eight
hours of the time they are received.
   (g)    At the time of installation, each alarm equipment supplier shall
furnish to the person for whom an alarm system has been installed, written
information as to how service can be obtained at any time, including the
telephone number to call for service; and such user shall be responsible for
having the device repaired as quickly as possible after learning, either from
his own sources or from notification by the City, that the device is not
working properly.
   (h)    The Director of Public Safety, or his designate, shall have the
authority, at reasonable times and upon prior notice where possible, to enter
upon any premises within the City to inspect the installation and operation of
an automatic protection device or signalling device, the purpose of which is to
report an emergency to the Police and/or Fire Department. Refusal to permit
entrance shall be grounds for revocation of the permit. Such officials may
apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for a warrant to enter under
circumstances where the owner or person in charge refuses or neglects entrance,
or is absent, to inspect the equipment. Where there is insufficient time to
reasonably obtain a search warrant under urgent circumstances, the safety
forces may enter the property to abate a nuisance or conduct a required
investigation.
   (i)    All equipment referred to in this chapter shall be maintained in good
operating condition. The Director, or his designate, may require that repairs
be made whenever the official has determined that such are necessary to assure
proper operation.
   (j)    The Director, or his designate, may serve written notice of his
intent to revoke a permit upon a permit holder at the permittee's application
address for violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or for any of
the following:
(1)    An incomplete or untruthful application;
(2)    Failure to properly maintain an installation; or
(3)    For having five or more false alarms in any twelve-month period.
   Such notice shall be given not less than seven days prior to revocation and
shall state the right of the permit holder to appeal to the Director, in
writing, within seven days of the order. If an appeal is filed, then the
Director shall hold a quasi-judicial hearing on the issues and any interested
party may be present, represented by an attorney, permitted to bring witnesses,
to examine and cross-examine any witness, after which the Director shall render
a decision on the basis of the facts presented. The decision shall be final. In
the event no appeal is filed, the permit shall be cancelled. Upon cancellation,
the Chief of the Police or Fire Department shall take whatever steps are
necessary to disconnect the alarms. Any service of notice shall be complete by
leaving it at the place where the equipment is located, or with a person living
or working at such place, or by delivery to a place indicated on the permit or
application.
(Ord. 1989-53. Passed 3-7-89.)
   702.09  SECURITY SURVEILLANCE SIGNS.
   (a)    One security surveillance sign is permitted per parcel, which shall
not be greater than one square foot in the area, and either installed in a
window or outside the principal building. An outside sign shall not exceed
three feet in height above the ground and shall be located within six feet of
the front of the building. The Chief Building and Zoning Inspector is
authorized to vary the location of an outside sign where unusual landscaping
features would prevent reasonable visibility, but not forward of the
landscaping.
   (b)    All outside security surveillance signs shall be pre-approved as set
forth in Chapter
1335 of the Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 1989-53. Passed 3-7-89.)
   702.10  LIABILITY OF CITY.
   The issuance, nonissuance or cancellation of any permit under this chapter
and any other act or omission of the City and/or its agents and employees shall
not constitute acceptance by the City of any liability whatsoever to maintain
any equipment, to answer alarms or to do anything else in connection therewith.
No person shall have an expectancy or reliance upon this voluntary service of
the City, and the City's liability in contract, tort or otherwise shall not
exceed a return of the permit fee.
(Ord. 1989-53. Passed 3-7-89.)
   702.11  RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Director of Public Safety, or his designate, may make and enforce such

   (a)    Initial Rates to Subscribers.  The grantee may establish initial
rates for its services in accordance with the rates contained in grantee's
application, as amended, for this franchise.
   (b)    Rate Change Procedure.
(1)    The rates as specified in subsection (a) hereof shall be in effect for a
minimum period of two years from the date of providing initial service.
(2)    The grantee may establish rates for service from time to time thereafter
by filing with the Clerk of Council a schedule of rates proposed and by
notifying its subscribers in writing at least sixty days prior to
implementation of the rate change.
(3)    Council shall have the right to determine whether or not it shall assume
rate regulation authority when the grantee achieves sixty percent (60%)
penetration of its potential subscribers. If Council declines rate regulation
authority, then rates may be modified by the grantee as specified in subsection
(b)(2) hereof. If Council assumes rate modification authority, then for the
next three years rates shall be subject to modification only by Council and
only in accordance with the following procedures:
A.    Council shall have the authority to review the following rates, fees and
charges:
1.    Rates for the provision of basic service to subscribers, whether
residential or commercial;
2.    Rates for the connection, installation and reinstatement, including
converters, of basic service, whether residential or commercial; and
3.    Rates for installation, connection and reinstatement of basic service
where unusual circumstances exist such as remote or inaccessible subscriber
locations or subscriber request for underground service drops.
B.    The grantee may petition Council for a change in rates by filing, in
triplicate, a proposed rate schedule with the Clerk of Council, which petition
shall include the justification(s) for the proposed schedule. Such petition
shall be filed at least ninety days prior to the requested implementation date
of the rate change. One copy of the petition shall remain on file with the
Clerk and be open for public inspection.
C.    Within ten days of notification by Council of the place and time
established for a hearing on such petition, the grantee shall notify its
subscribers of the hearing by announcement on at least two channels of its
system between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. for five consecutive days.
Additionally, hearings shall be announced in a newspaper of general circulation
at least five days before the date of the hearing. Following all proper notice
but in no event later than ninety days from the date of such petition, Council
shall hold an appropriate public hearing to consider the proposed new rates, at
which hearing all parties desiring to be heard, including the grantee, shall be
heard on any matters  relating to the performance of this franchise, the
grantee's services and the proposed new rates.
D.    Within ninety days after such hearing, Council shall render a written
decision on the grantee's position, either accepting, rejecting or modifying
the same and reciting the basis of its decision. 
E.    If Council fails to act within ninety days of the grantee's petition
filed pursuant to subsection (b)(3)B. hereof, the grantee shall thereafter be
entitled to put its proposed new rates into effect on a provisional basis,
provided that it shall keep a full and accurate accounting of all income
resulting from such provisional rates and shall be obliged, for a period of six
months thereafter, to refund the amount by which such provisional rates exceed
the rates ultimately established by Council. Upon request by Council, the
grantee shall provide a bond or other reasonable surety to ensure that possible
refunds due under this subsection shall be promptly made. The bond or surety
shall be in an amount not to exceed the difference between the amount of
revenues generated in six months at the previously existing rates and the
amount of revenues expected to be generated in six months at the provisional
rates. Such bond shall be in a form approved by the Director of Law.
F.    The criteria for Council's decision in such matters shall be the
establishment of rates which are fair and reasonable to both the grantee and
its subscribers and shall be generally defined to be the minimum rates
necessary to meet all applicable costs of service, including fair return on all
invested capital, all assuming efficient and economical management.
G.    In order for Council to determine whether proposed rate changes comport
with the criteria established in subsection (b)(3)F. hereof the grantee's
petition for a rate increase shall include the following financial reports
acceptable to Council and which shall reflect the operations of its cable
television system within the City:

detail and/or footnotes as may be necessary to provide the City with the
information needed to make accurate determinations as to the financial
condition of the system. All financial statements shall be certified as
accurate by an officer of the grantee.
H.   Any disagreement between the City and the grantee concerning
interpretations and calculations of the financial and statistical information
provided by the grantee may be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (c)    All Rates To Be Non-Discriminatory.  The grantee shall administer any
and all rates and charges so as not to give preference to nor discriminate
among subscribers of like category or class. Nothing in the foregoing shall be
deemed to prevent the grantee from establishing:
(1)    Special temporary reduced rates for periodic promotional offers to
attract new subscribers or for subscribers who pay promptly;
(2)    Reasonable policies for deposits, penalties or denial of service where a
particular subscriber has proven a bona fide credit problem; or
(3)    Separate rates for commercial and noncommercial users of access channels
.
   (d)    Advance Charges and Deposits.  The grantee may require subscribers to
pay for basic subscriber service one month in advance. The grantee may also
require a reasonable security deposit for provision of the basic converter
unit. Such deposit, in the absence of theft or avoidable damage to the

   737.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
(a)    "Helicopter" means an air-borne vehicle used for the transportation of
persons or material whose support in the air is normally derived from the
vertical lift or force produced by airfoils or wings mechanically rotated about
an approximately vertical axis.
(b)    "Heliport" means an area, either at ground level or elevated on a
structure, that is used or intended to be used for landing or taking off of
helicopters and may include some or all of the various facilities useful to
helicopter operations such as maintenance, refueling and storage facilities.
(c)    "Helistop" means a heliport without auxiliary facilities, intended to be
used only for the taking off and landing of helicopters.
(Ord. 1968-34. Passed 4-22-68.)
   737.02  LANDINGS AND TAKE-OFFS.
   No person shall land, discharge, load or take-off in a helicopter at any
place within the City except at a helistop, the location and construction of
which has been approved by the Director of Public Safety and which conforms to
the specifications and requirements of this chapter; however, the Director of
Public Safety may approve the landing or take-off of a helicopter at a
different location approved by him or his designated representative on an
individual basis in cases of emergency, public ceremony or other public
necessity.
(Ord. 1968-34. Passed 4-22-68.)
   737.03  MINIMUM HELISTOP SPECIFICATIONS.
   The landing and take-off area of every location approved or used as a
helistop shall consist of a hard-surfaced or grassed area with good drainage
and free of dust and gravel. Each helistop landing and take-off area shall be
circular or rectangular in shape; if circular, the diameter, or if rectangular,
any side dimension, of such landing and take-off area shall be at least twice
the length of any helicopter using it. Such area shall be set aside exclusively
for taking off and landing, shall be free of trees, wires or other obstructions
and shall be enclosed by a fence at least two feet in height.
   Every helistop shall have at least two approach paths free and clear of
obstructions extending outward and upward from the landing and take-off area at
an angle of eight feet horizontally to one foot vertically, flaring to a width
of 500 feet at an altitude of 500 feet. The center line of such approach paths
or planes shall be separated by an arc of at least 135 degrees. The remaining
peripheral area surrounding the landing and take-off area shall be free and
clear of obstructions at an angle of two feet horizontally to one foot
vertically to a lateral distance of 250 feet from the landing and take-off
area.
   No approach path shall be used and no helicopter shall be flown at an
elevation of less than 500 feet over a residence building, school or other
public building, and not less than 200 feet over any other building or public
highway, except for the purpose of landing or taking off from an approved
helistop.
   No fueling, repairing or maintenance of helicopters shall be performed at
such helistop, except in case of emergency, and no fuel shall be stored.
(Ord. 1968-34. Passed 4-22-68.)
   737.04  ROOFTOP OR ELEVATED HELISTOPS.
   Every rooftop or platform helistop shall be constructed of noncombustible
material having a fire resistance rating of not less than two hours, supported
by a building or structure of equivalent fire resistance rating. Openings in
the roof or platform shall not be permitted in the immediate landing area. At
least two approved means of egress, removed from each other, shall be provided
from each rooftop landing area. Such means of egress shall be by enclosed
stairways at least equal in fire resistance rating to that required by the
Building Code for the specific occupancy of the building.
   Fire extinguishing systems consisting of dry mechanical portable
extinguishers, building standpipe systems or other sources of water supply, and
at least two hose stations remote from each other, shall be provided subject to
detailed specifications prescribed by the Fire Chief.
(Ord. 1968-34. Passed 4-22-68.)
   737.05  SUBMISSION OF PLANS.
   Every person, firm or corporation intending to establish and use a helistop
within the City shall first submit plans for approval to the Director of Public
Safety, consisting of the following:
(a)    A statement as to the intended use of the helistop, whether public or
private, commercial or otherwise; the identity and financial responsibility of
the management; the frequency of flights; the size, type and manufacture of
equipment intended to be used; and the hours of operation.
(b)    A plan of the proposed site showing dimensions of the entire usable
areas, dimensions of actual landing and take-off areas, all obstructions within
1000 feet of the heliport, indicating their heights, drawings of flight and
approach paths within 1000 feet of the heliport, and lighting, access and
drainage plans.
(c)    A report by a professional engineer, approved by the Building and Zoning
Inspector, showing that the roof structure or platform is designed to support
concentrated loads on any one square foot equivalent to three-fourths gross
weight of the largest helicopter to be accommodated. It is not a requirement of
this subsection that every square foot of the entire roof area be stressed to
withstand such impact load simultaneously, but only that area with which the
main landing gear of the helicopter will be in contact. A simple load
distributing pad, twenty feet by twenty feet by four inches, constructed of a
noncombustible material, will suffice in Class I and Class II-type helistops.
(Ord. 1968-34. Passed 4-22-68.)
   737.06  APPROVAL OF HELISTOP.
   No approval of plans and operation shall be given for a proposed helistop
unless the Director of Public Safety is satisfied that all provisions of this
chapter and other provisions of the Codified Ordinances will be complied with,
that the public safety will be protected and that the use and enjoyment of
neighboring property will not be adversely affected.
   Every such approval shall be subject to:
(a)    Continuing compliance with the provisions of this chapter and with
applicable Federal Aviation Agency regulations.
(b)    The prohibition of smoking within the helistop area.
(c)    The right and authority of the Director of Public Safety to cancel such
approval and prohibit the use of such helistop upon noncompliance with the
provisions of this chapter, or F.A.A. regulations, or for any other reasonable
cause or ground, based upon the protection of the public safety, health or
welfare. All interested parties will be notified in writing of the specific
reasons for such cancellation and be given an opportunity to take corrective
action. Upon notification that satisfactory corrective measures have been
taken, the Director of Public Safety may reapprove the use thereof.
(Ord. 1968-34. Passed 4-22-68.)
   737.07  PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)    No person shall operate a helicopter to or from an approved helistop
within the City without obtaining prior approval from the Director of Public
Safety. Training flights to or from approved helistops in the City are
prohibited under any circumstances.
   (b)    Helistops within the City may not be used for any purpose other than

policies or a certificate of insurance.
(c)    Purpose and frequency of proposed operation as evidenced by a statement
in writing by the operator.

   737.10  HELIPORTS PROHIBITED.
   "Heliports", as defined in Section
737.01 and as distinguished from "helistops", shall not be permitted within the
City. Areas within the City presently classed as Airport Districts under the
Zoning Code shall be exempted from the prohibition of this section.

under which the applicant does or will do business, the type of vehicle for
which the license is desired, the length of time such vehicle has been in use,
the number of persons it is capable of carrying, the motor power thereof, the
design and color scheme thereof and the local symbol used or proposed to be
used by the applicant on such vehicle. If such vehicle is to be colored and
marked in accordance with the laws and regulations of the State with respect to
school buses, the application shall so state.
   The Director may require such additional information as to the financial
responsibility and fitness of management of officers and stockholders of the
applicant, and such other information as he may desire. The application,
together with any statements or further information required by the Director,
shall have affixed thereto an affidavit duly sworn to by the applicant.
However, in the case of applicants already licensed by a municipality abutting
the City and whose principal business is the carrying of passengers elsewhere
than in the City, it may be sufficient to file an affidavit containing a
description of the vehicle, together with the license number of the
municipality issuing such license, and a statement as to the type or kind of
financial responsibility filed with the municipality which issued such license
covering the operation of such vehicle.
(Ord. 1968-132. Passed 12-9-68.)
   765.04  INSPECTION.
   No school bus covered by the terms of this chapter shall be licensed until
it has been thoroughly and carefully inspected and examined by the Director of
Public Safety, or by some person designated by him, and found to be in a
thoroughly safe condition for the transportation of passengers; provided,
however, that in the case of vehicles already licensed by a municipality
abutting the City or bearing a current sticker or decal indicating that such
school bus has been inspected and approved by the State Highway Patrol, such
inspection may be waived by the Director.
   The Director is hereby authorized to establish such reasonable rules and
regulations for the inspection of such school buses, and their appurtenances,
construction and condition of fitness as he shall deem best for the safety and
adequate transportation of passengers
and the public in general.
(Ord. 1968-132. Passed 12-9-68.)
   765.05  BOND OR LIABILITY INSURANCE REQUIRED.
   No person shall operate a school bus or cause or permit such to be operated,
nor shall any license be issued hereunder, until and unless the applicant for
such license deposits with the Director of Finance either:
(a)    A policy or certificate of liability insurance for each school bus for
which a license is sought, acceptable to and approved by the Director of Law,
indemnifying the applicant in the sum of at least one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000) for injury to one person and five hundred thousand dollars
($500,000) for injury to more than one person and twenty thousand dollars
($20,000) property damage in any one accident, through the operation of each
school bus of the applicant. The policy shall further contain a clause
obligating the insurance company to give ten days written notice to the
Director of Public Safety before cancellation of such policy. Such license
shall expire upon the lapse or termination of the policy of insurance unless a
new policy of insurance meeting the requirements of this subsection is
substituted therefor or unless the licensee submits a bond as provided in
subsection (b) hereof; or
(b)    A bond of the applicant with a solvent and responsible surety company
authorized to act as surety under the laws of the State, this bond conditioned
upon the applicant paying all final judgments recovered against the applicant
as the result of any accident arising out of the operation of any of the
applicant's school buses in or within the City. This bond shall be in the
amount of not less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), shall be approved by
the Director of Law and shall contain a clause obligating the surety to give
ten days written notice to the Director of Public Safety before cancellation.
(c)    It shall be the duty of every such licensee to furnish to the Director
of Public Safety not later than the third day of each month, a full, accurate
and complete statement of subsequent claims filed and judgments rendered
against such licensee arising out the operation of school buses, which
statement shall be in such form as the Director of Public Safety shall
prescribe. Any licensee failing to comply with the requirements of this
subsection shall be subject to the penalty provided for in Section
765.99, provided that each day's failure or neglect shall constitute a separate
offense.
(d)    Such bond or policy of insurance shall contain a provision for a
continuing liability thereunder to the full amount thereof, notwithstanding any
recovery thereon. If at any time in the judgment of the Director of Public
Safety such bond or policy is not sufficient for any cause the Director of
Public Safety may order the owner of such school bus to replace such bond or
policy with another approved by the Director of Public Safety and the Director
of Law. Failure to furnish such replacement bond or policy within the time
specified in such order shall function as a revocation of the license to
operate the particular vehicle or vehicles covered by the bond or policy
ordered replaced.
(e)    In the case of school buses already licensed by a municipality abutting
the City and inspected and approved by the State Highway Patrol and for which a
bond or policy or certificate of liability insurance has been furnished as per
subsection (a) or (b) hereof to the municipality issuing such license, it shall
be sufficient for the owner or operator of such school bus to file a copy of
such bond or policy or certificate of insurance with the Director of Finance of
this City; provided,  however, that such bond or policy or certificate of
insurance is approved by the Director of Public Safety and Director of Law of
this City, which approval shall not be given unless the terms of such bond or
policy or certificate of insurance are such as will, in the opinion of the
Director of Law, protect passengers or persons or persons or property injured
or damaged by the operation of such school bus in the City or while carrying
passengers to or from the City.
(Ord. 1968-132. Passed 12-9-68. )
   765.06  ISSUANCE OF LICENSE TO OPERATE.
   If the Director of Public Safety finds that the vehicle for which the
license to operate is sought is fit and safe for the transportation of
passengers under such rules and regulations as the Director may promulgate, he
shall issue to such owner a license to operate such a vehicle upon the owners
depositing the insurance policy or bond heretofore described and paying the
license fee hereinafter set forth.
   There shall be delivered to such owner a license of the size and design
prescribed by the Director which shall contain the official license number, the
name and address of the licensee and such other information as the Director
shall prescribe. Such license shall be affixed to the interior of the school
bus so licensed, so as to be readily accessible and visible to any one desiring
to examine the same. Any license issued hereunder shall expire on June 30 of
the year in which it was issued, unless sooner suspended or revoked for any
cause by the Director.
(Ord. 1968-132. Passed 12-9-68.)
   765.07  FEES FOR LICENSE TO OPERATE .
   Every licensee hereunder shall pay a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) per year
for each school bus licensed to operate. In instances of operators of over
fifteen school buses, however, such fee shall not exceed one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00) per year, regardless of the number of vehicles operated.
(Ord. 1968-132. Passed 12-9-68.)
   765.08  SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF LICENSE TO OPERATE.
   Any license to operate may be suspended or revoked at any time by the
Director of Public Safety in case:
(a)    The Director finds the owner's past record to be unsatisfactory;
(b)    The owner fails to operate his school bus or buses in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter and other ordinances of the City and laws of the
State;
(c)    The owner fails to keep on deposit with the City the policy of insurance
or bond of indemnity hereinabove described or to comply with any order of the
Director in replacing the same with other policies of insurance or bonds of
indemnity as hereinabove provided for. However, no license to operate shall be
revoked unless and until due notice of a hearing has been given to the holder
thereof and such hearing has been duly had thereon.
   Any person whose license to operate has been revoked by the Director may
appeal from the decision of the Director thereon to the Board of Appeals as
hereinafter provided.

(Ord. 1968-132. Passed 12-9-68.)
   765.18  DUTIES OF DRIVERS.
   Drivers shall observe the following requirements while operating school
buses within the City:
(a)    Safety in Operation.  Operators of school buses shall at all times
operate such vehicles in a safe, prudent and careful manner having due regard
for the traffic and the use of the highway by others.
(b)    Speed.  No school bus shall be operated on the highways or streets at a
speed in excess of the safe and legal speed for the driving conditions
prevailing. For example, a school bus shall not cut in and out of moving
traffic. When traffic is congested, when road conditions are hazardous or when
bad weather reduces driver visibility, the driver shall definitely reduce his
speed to meet these conditions.
(c)    Overtaking and Passing.  A school bus shall not be driven to the left of
the center line of the roadway in overtaking and passing traffic proceeding in
the same direction unless such left side is clearly visible and free of
oncoming traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such overtaking and
passing to be completed without interfering with the safe operation of any
traffic approaching from the opposite direction or any traffic overtaken.
(d)    Allowing Others to Pass.  The school bus driver shall be considerate of
other motorists and shall afford opportunity for other vehicles to pass if a
long line of vehicles accumulates at the rear of the bus. While stopped but not
loading or discharging pupils, the driver shall turn off his flasher lights and
signal traffic to proceed.
(e)    Parking Prohibited.  A school bus shall not be parked within the limits
of the highway right of way when not in use.
(f)    Maintaining Space Between Vehicles.  The operator of a school bus shall
remain at least 100 feet from the preceding moving vehicle when driving on the
school grounds and 400 feet while driving along the highway at normal speed.
(g)    Doors.  The doors of a school bus shall be kept closed while the bus is
in motion and shall be kept closed until the bus is completely stopped to take
on or discharge pupils. The emergency door shall be equipped with a fastening
device which may be quickly released, but which is protected from accidental
release. Control from the driver's seat is not permitted. Provision for opening
from the outside shall consist of a type of handle of such design as to prevent
hitching but that will permit opening when necessary.
(h)    Railroad Crossings.  Before crossing at grade any railroad track the
driver shall stop the school bus and turn on the flashing stop lights and while
so stopped he shall listen through an open door or open window and look in both
directions along the track for any approaching train and for signals indicating
the approach of a train and shall proceed only upon exercising due care after
stopping, looking and listening as required by this section. Upon proceeding,
after turning off the  flashing stop lights, the driver shall cross only in
such gear of the vehicle that will obviate the necessity for changing gears
while traversing such crossing and shall not shift gears while crossing the
tracks.
(i)    Loading and Unloading on School Grounds.
(1)   All loading and unloading at the school buildings shall be done on the
school grounds or, where that is impossible, away from all traffic at the side
of the  road adjoining the school grounds with the bus facing in the legal
direction and  on the legal side of the road.
(2)   All stop signal lamps shall be turned off while loading and unloading at
the school building in order that traffic may proceed without interference.
(j)    Care When Fueling.  The driver shall not permit the gasoline tank to be
filled  while pupils are on the bus or while the motor is running.
(k)    Loading and Unloading Procedure.
(1)    Every pupil should be seated in an assigned seat. No bus shall be
overloaded. The bus shall be considered overloaded when standees are in excess
of ten percent of the rated seating capacity of the bus.
(2)   The driver shall not permit an uneven distribution of his load. When
picking  up pupils he shall alternate the filling of front and rear seats. When
unloading, care shall be taken that the pupils remaining are fairly evenly
distributed between front and rear seats. The pupils shall not move from seat
to seat  while the bus is in motion.
(3)    When approaching a stop sign or signal the bus driver shall cause the
warning  flasher lights to operate in advance of that sign or signal so that
motorists  may have sufficient warning of his intention.
(4)    In receiving and discharging pupils on the highway the bus shall be
driven to the extreme right side of the paved or traveled portion of the
roadway and brought to a full stop, with the flasher or warning lights in
operation the entire time the bus remains stationary. Whenever any warning
light fails to operate, the bus driver shall assume the responsibility of
assuring the safe crossing for pupils to their residence side of the highway.
(5)    Whenever a school bus stops to discharge or load pupils who must cross
the road at a point not under the control of a traffic officer or a clearly
visible electrical or mechanical traffic signal, the pupils shall cross the
highway at a point approximately ten feet in front of the standing bus. The bus
shall not be started until the pupils are safely on their residence side of the
road or aboard the bus.
(6)    In no event shall a bus be driven backward on the school grounds where
children are being loaded or unloaded.
(7)    The bus driver shall be the sole operator of the entrance door and shall
not open the door until traffic has cleared the bus in both directions. Pupils 
who must cross the highway to reach their destination shall cross in front of
the stopped bus only after the driver has verified that the warning lamps are
operating and has notified them that it is safe to cross.
(8)    The door shall not be closed and the bus started again until such pupils
have reached their residence side of the road.
(9)    The driver of a school bus shall not use or permit the use of tobacco,
alcohol or narcotics in any form while pupils are riding in the bus.
(10)    The driver shall not leave the bus until he has stopped the engine,
removed the ignition key and set the brakes.
(11)    All buses shall be thoroughly cleaned on the inside daily and cleaned
on the outside as often as is necessary to keep the front and rear windows,
mirrors and markings clearly visible.
(12)    Every school bus shall be equipped with a mirror positioned so that
from the driver's seat the roadway can be viewed from the front bumper forward.
(l)    Maintenance of Order.  The driver shall be in complete charge of the bus
at all times and shall be responsible for order. If unable to manage any pupil,
the driver shall report the unmanageable pupil to the Division of Police. He
shall not exclude a pupil from a bus.
(Ord. 1968-132. Passed 12-9-68.)
   765.19  SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF DRIVER’S LICENSE.
   A driver's license may be suspended or revoked at any time by the Director
of Public Safety for violations of any of the provisions of this chapter. Any
such suspension shall be noted on the license, together with a statement of the
reasons therefor. No driver whose license has been revoked shall again be
licensed as a driver under this chapter unless upon presentation of reasons
satisfactory to the Director.
(Ord. 1968-132.  Passed 12-9-68.)
   765.20  FRAUDULENT INFORMATION.
   No person shall give any fictitious information or practice any fraud,
misrepresentation or subterfuge in securing or attempting to secure a
certificate of necessity, a license to operate or a driver's license provided
for in this chapter.
(Ord. 1968-132. Passed 12-9-68.)
   765.21  BOARD OF APPEALS.
   An appeal from any decision of the Director of Public Safety revoking a
certificate of necessity, a license to operate or a driver's license may be
made to a Board of Appeals which is hereby created and which shall be composed
of the Mayor, or, in case the Mayor is also acting as the Director of Public

revocation, give written notice of such appeal to the Director of Public Safety

("Certificate") shall be filed with the Director on such forms as the Director
or his designate shall prescribe. Such an application shall contain a statement
of the name and address of the applicant and, if the applicant is other than an

equipment to be used, the number of taxicabs to be operated and a statement
that the applicant, if granted a Certificate, will operate his taxicab business
so as to be available for service to the public at all hours unless the
applicant shall demonstrate that the public convenience and necessity do not
require service at all hours, and, in addition, such other facts as may be
necessary. The application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable application
fee of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) to cover the expenses of the

   769.06  HEARING BEFORE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC SAFETY.
   Upon receipt of the initial application or a subsequent application to amend
a Certificate and whenever the applicant has complied with all the conditions
and regulations relating to the filing of his application, it shall be the duty
of the Director to fix a date for a hearing on such application, which shall
not be less than thirty days from the date of filing. The Director shall
forward a notice thereof to Council at its next regular meeting. Notice of the
hearing shall be given to all persons interested, including the operators of
all other taxicabs in the City, at least five days before the date set for such
hearing.
   At the hearing, the Director, or his designate, shall receive information
and argument as to the need or desirability of allowing another taxicab
business in the City, with respect to the public convenience and necessity,
from the applicant and from other persons who may appear on their own behalf or

necessity require the issuance of the Certificate applied for.
(Ord. 1999-23. Passed 1-19-99.)

service;
(b)    The financial responsibility of the applicant;
(c)    The number, kind and type of equipment to be used; and
(d)    Whether the additional taxicab service will result in such congestion of
traffic in the streets and at the taxicab stands as will constitute a
demoralization of the taxicab business or be conducive to a greater public
hazard. The judgment of the Director on the question of convenience and
necessity, as well as the qualifications of the applicant, shall be final and
conclusive.

(Ord. 1958-46. Passed 6-23-58.)
   769.12  INFORMATION TO BE FILED.

three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) for injury to more than one person,
and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) property damage in any one accident
resulting from the operation of the taxicab of such operator. The policy shall
further contain a clause obligating the insurer to give ten days written notice
to the Director before cancellation or expiration of the policy. The
Certificate shall expire upon the lapse or termination of the policy of
insurance. Such policy of insurance shall also contain a provision for the
continuing liability thereunder for the full amount, notwithstanding any
recovery thereon. If at any time, in the judgment of the Director, such policy
of insurance is not sufficient for any cause, the Director may require the
operator of such taxicab to replace the policy of insurance with another
approved by the Director.

When the application for a license is denied, one copy of the photograph shall
be returned to the applicant and the other kept in the files of the office of

   915.01  PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   Purpose and Policy.  This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for
discharges into the Willoughby-Eastlake wastewater collection and treatment
systems, and enables the City to protect public health in conformity with all
applicable local, State and Federal laws relating thereto.  The objectives of
this chapter are:
(1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater treatment
system which will interfere with the normal operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting municipal sludge;
(2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater treatment
system which do not receive adequate treatment in the POTW, and which will pass
through the system into receiving waters, or the atmosphere, or otherwise be
incompatible with the system;
(3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge
from the system; and
(4)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the storm drainage system
which may contribute to the degradation of the system and receiving stream.
   (b)   Implementation.  This chapter provides for the regulation of
discharges into the POTW through the issuance of permits, the execution of
binding contracts and the enforcement of administrative regulations.  Nothing
in this chapter shall limit the right of the Director to reject wastes or to
contract for a special agreement or arrangement for the treatment and disposal
of wastes unless such actions are contrary to State and Federal laws and
regulations.

sewage, the excess shall be subjected to a surcharge derived in accordance with
the following formulas:
 
SC =   [(SS-225) x F x 8.34 x CS] + [(CBOD-185) x F x 8.34 x CB] = F x 8.34 x [
       (SS-225) CS + (CBOD-185) x CB]
SC =   Surcharge based on average daily flow.
SS =   Total suspended solids in wastes as discharged in mg/l.
225 =  Suspended solids concentrations in normal sewage in mg/l.

or
SC =   [(SS-225) x F x 8.34 x CS] + [(COD-250) x F x 8.34 x CC] = F x 8.34 x [
       (SS-225) x CS + (COD-250) x CC]
COD =  Total C.O.D. in wastes as discharged in mg/l.
250 =  C.O.D. concentration in normal sewage in mg/l.
CC =   Cost to treat one pound of C.O.D. in cents per pound.

       removed.
or
SC =   (P-8) x F x 8.34 x CP
P =    Total phosphorus in wastes as discharged in mg/l.
8 =    Total phosphorus concentration in normal sewage in mg/l.
CP =   Cost to treat one pound of phosphorus in cents per pound.
       Total operating cost attributable to phosphorus/total pounds of
       phosphorus removed.
or
SC =   (OG-80) x F x 8.34 x COG
OG =   Total oil and grease in wastes as discharged in mg/l.
80 =   Total oil and grease concentration in normal sewage in mg/l.
COG =  Cost to remove one pound of oil and grease in cents per pound.
       Total operating cost attributable to oil and grease/total pounds of oil
       and grease removed.
(2)   Use of C.B.O.D. and C.O.D. analyses.  Whenever a waste cannot be analyzed
by a C.B.O.D. test, the C.O.D. result shall prevail in calculating a
surcharge.  Whenever both testing methods are possible, the POTW shall
determine which analysis shall apply in computing the surcharge based on which
will provide the higher surcharge.
(3)   Annual review of strength surcharge.  On or before March 1 of each year,
the strength surcharge for the POTW for the previous year shall be reviewed. 
The cost to treat the C.B.O.D., C.O.D., oil and grease, suspended solids and
phosphorus shall be based on the total operating cost of the sewerage works. 
Increases or decreases in the cost of treating and disposing of excess amounts
of C.B.O.D., C.O.D., oil and grease, suspended solids and phosphorus shall be
reflected on a proportionate basis in the strength surcharge on the basis of
cost per pound.

time by the POTW and any change in occupancy shall be immediately reported to
the POTW.  Such information shall be an occupant's charge.
3.   Disclosure of site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing plans, and
details to show all sewers, sewer connections, floor drains, inspection
manholes, sampling chambers and appurtenances by size, location and elevations.
4.   All users within any multi-unit building are required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit as prescribed in this chapter.
5.   In the event that a discharge occurs from any of the occupants and/or
tenants of the multi-unit building, such discharge may be considered for all
purposes herein as being the discharge of the owner, lessor, tenant, and/or
occupant and, as such, the owner, lessor, tenant, and/or occupant shall be
subject to the same rights and penalties as contained in this chapter.
      (3)   Permit modifications.  The Director reserves the right to amend any
wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder in order to assure compliance by
the user with applicable laws and regulations.  Within nine months of the
promulgation of a national categorical pretreatment standard, the wastewater
discharge permit of each user subject to such standards shall be revised to
require compliance with such standards within the time frame prescribed by such
standards.  All national categorical pretreatment standards adopted after the
promulgation of this chapter shall be adopted by the City as part of this
chapter.  Where a user, subject to a national categorical pretreatment
standard, has not previously submitted an application for a wastewater
discharge permit as required herein, the user shall apply for a wastewater
discharge permit from the POTW within 180 days after the promulgation of the
applicable national categorical pretreatment standard by the U.S. EPA.  In
addition, the discharger with an existing wastewater discharge permit shall
submit to the POTW within 180 days after the promulgation of an applicable
national categorical standard, the information required herein.  The user shall
be informed of any proposed changes in his permit at least thirty days prior to
the effective date of change.  Any changes or new conditions in the permit
shall include a reasonable time schedule for the information required,
including compliance dates.  (Ord. 1991-118.  Passed 8-6-91.)
      (4)   Permit conditions.  Wastewater discharge permits shall be expressly
subject to all provisions of this chapter, and all other applicable
regulations, user charges and fees established by the City.  Permits may
contain the following:
         A.   The unit charge or schedule of user charges and fees for the
wastewater to be discharged to a sanitary sewer;
         B.   Limits on the minimum and maximum wastewater constituents and
characteristics, including Best Management Practices, based on applicable
pretreatment standards;

            (Ord. 1991-118.  Passed 8-6-91.)
         J.   Requirements to control slug discharges, if determined by the
Director to be necessary;
         K.   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the Director to ensure
compliance with this chapter.
         L.   BMP Compliance Documentation.
            1.   Discharges subject to a BMP shall develop a BMP plan and
submit it to the City for review and approval as specified in their wastewater
discharge permit.  The objective of this plan shall be to identify pollution
prevention and wastewater reduction opportunities and to implement those
opportunities that are technically and economically feasible.
            2.   Any discharger subject to a BMP may be required to self
monitor their flow and analyze its characteristics as specified in their
wastewater discharge permit.  Costs for the monitoring and analyses shall be
borne by the discharger.  The City may exercise the right to require monitoring
or analysis on an individual basis if the City becomes aware of increases in
certain waste loadings.
            3.   Any discharger subject to a BMP shall submit to the City at
the time of their permit renewal, unless required more frequently by the City,
an annual report documenting compliance with the BMP plan as specified in their
wastewater discharge permit.  Costs for the monitoring and analysis (if any),
and reporting shall be borne by the discharger.  (Ord. 2010-69.  Passed 6-8-
10.)
      (5)   Permit duration.  Wastewater discharge permits shall be issued for
one year.  A permit may be issued for a period less than one year, or may be
stated to expire on a specific date.  The user shall apply for permit
reissuance prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit.  The terms
and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the Director
during the term of the permit as limitations or requirements.
      (6)   Permit transfer.  Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a
specific user for a specific operation and location, and are not assignable to
another user or location without the prior written approval of the Director.
   (c)   Reporting Requirements for Permittee.
      (1)   Baseline monitoring report (BMR).  New sources and existing sources
that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard shall submit a baseline monitoring report at least ninety
days prior to commencement of the facility's discharge to the POTW.  These
reports are to include:
         A.   A list of environmental control permits held by the user;
         B.   A description of the user's operations, information on flow and
amount of regulated pollutants discharged to the POTW;
         C.   A certification of whether the user is currently in compliance
with the applicable categorical standard(s).  For new sources, the user may
provide estimates for the information on production, flow, and the presence and
quantity of regulated pollutants in its wastestream.
            (Ord. 1991-118.  Passed 8-6-91.)
         D.   Where the Categorical Standard requires compliance with a BMP or
pollution prevention alternative, the User shall submit documentation as
required by the Director or the applicable Pretreatment Standard necessary to
determine compliance with the standard.  (Ord. 2010-69.  Passed 6-8-10.)
      (2)   Compliance date report.  Within ninety days following the date for
final compliance by the user with applicable pretreatment standards set forth
in this chapter, any user subject to this chapter shall submit to the POTW a
report indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated
substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow
in gallons.  The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional operating and maintenance or pretreatment is necessary to bring the
user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements.  This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative
of the user, and certified to by a professional. 
         For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits, the
ninety-day compliance report must include a reasonable measure of the user's
long-term production rate.
         (Ord. 1991-118.  Passed 8-6-91.)
      (3)   Periodic compliance reports.  All industrial users shall submit
periodic compliance reports indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in their discharge.  The frequency of monitoring and reporting shall
be as prescribed in the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit.  Results
of sampling above the minimum required shall also be reported if analyses were
conducted according to methodology herein.  These reports shall be certified
and signed by an authorized representative of the discharger.  In cases where
the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution
prevention alternative, the User shall submit documentation required by the
Director or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine the compliance
status of the User.  (Ord. 2010-69.  Passed 6-8- 10.)
   (d)   Monitoring Facilities.
      (1)   Construction of sampling manhole.  When required by the Director,
the owner or operator of any property served by a sewer or sewers shall install
a suitable manhole or manholes together with such necessary meters or other
appurtenances in the sewer(s) to facilitate inspection, sampling and flow
measurement of each sewer's discharge from such premises.  Such manholes, when
required shall be accessible and safely located.  The manhole shall be
installed by the owner or user at his expense, and shall be maintained by him
so as to be safe and accessible at all times.  Such manhole shall be provided
by the owner within forty-five days after it has been required, and shall be
constructed and designed as provided in accordance with plans approved by the
Director.
      (2)   Monitoring equipment.
         A.   When required by the Director, the owner or user of any premises
or facility discharging industrial wastes into the system shall install, at his
own cost and expense, suitable monitoring equipment to facilitate the accurate
observation, sampling and measurement of wastes.  Such equipment shall be
maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all times.
         B.   The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
user's premises outside of the building.  When such a location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the Director may allow such
facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, with the
approval of the public agency having jurisdiction over such street or sidewalk,
and located so that it shall not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
         C.   When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the
Director may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each
user.  When there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the Director
may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate
discharge.
         D.   Whether construction on public or private property, the
monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Director's
requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (e)   Inspection and Sampling.
      (1)   Access for inspection.  The Director shall inspect the facilities
of any user to ascertain whether the purposes of this chapter are being met,
and all requirements are being complied with.  Persons or occupants of premises
where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the Director ready access
at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of
inspection, sampling or records examination and copying, or in performance of
any of their duties to determine compliance with the requirements of this
chapter.  The Director or the EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
      (2)   Periodic determination of wastewater strength.  The strength of any
water or wastes shall be determined monthly or quarterly in accordance with
current billing procedure from samples taken at the manhole described herein,
or at any period of time and in such manner as the Director may elect.  (Ord.
1991-118.  Passed 8-6-91.)
      (3)   Sampling procedures.  All measurements, tests and analyses of the
characteristics of water and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter
shall be determined at the control manhole provided.  In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected.  Compliance determinations with respect to the
prohibitions and limitations stated in this chapter shall be made as determined
by the Director or as stated in the wastewater discharge permit.
      (4)   Sample collection.  Samples collected to satisfy reporting
requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that
is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
         A.   Except as indicated in Paragraph B. and C. below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using a 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
technique, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Superintendent.  Where time-proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be representative
of the discharge.  Using protocols (including appropriate preservation)
specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab
samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the
analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may
be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil
and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.  Composite samples
for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in
approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as appropriate.  In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with Instantaneous
Limits.
         B.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
         C.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-
day compliance reports required in Section
915.07(c)(1), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for
facilities for which historical sampling data does not exist; for facilities
for which historical data is available, the Superintendent may authorize a
lower minimum.  For the reports required in Section
915.07(c)(2), the Industrial User is required to collect the number of grab
samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable Pretreatment
Standards and Requirements.
            (Ord. 2010-69.  Passed 6-8-10.)
      (5)   Cost of sampling operations.  The cost of sampling contemplated
herein, shall be charged to the industry, user, or owner as the Director shall
determine.  However, the City shall look to the owner of the property for any
amount which remains unpaid and which may be placed on the property as a lien
to be collected in the same manner as other taxes.  Normal operation of gauging
and sampling of any manhole or any other point of discharge shall be the time
required, as determined by the Director, to obtain representative samples of
the effluent discharged.  Cost shall be based on an hourly rate for the person
sampling and any other cost that might be necessary to procure a representative
sample.
         A.   Cost of Analytical Work Performed.  All costs for analytical
tests which are performed by the POTW or any other testing facility at the
POTW's discretion, and performed for an industry because of its discharge to a
public sewer and to determine compliance, shall be borne by the owner or user
being tested.
         B.   Cost of Installation Involving Overtime.  Where an industrial or
commercial user discharges its effluent to a manhole or manholes, used as
gauging and sampling points, and the effluent is of such volume and duration
that installation of hydraulic equipment cannot be made until the user ceases
its operation, by closedown, the costs of making the installation, involving
overtime pay, shall be at the expense of the owner or user.  If the plant or
premises elects to make the hydraulic installations with their own personnel,
the installation shall be set up in a manner approved by the Director.  In the
event that a period in excess of a standard five-day, forty-hour week is
required for City personnel to properly gauge, sample and analyze the
discharged effluent, the extra costs shall be at the expense of the owner or
user.
      (6)   Laboratory testing methods.  All measurements, tests and analyses
of the characteristics of water and wastes shall be made in conformance with
the EPA-approved methodology of 40 CFR 136.
      (7)   Sampling by industrial users.  If sampling performed by an
industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the POTW within
twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation.  The user shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis
to the POTW within thirty days after becoming aware of the violation.
      (8)   Supplemental report requirement for industrial users.  If an
industrial user subject to reporting requirements monitors any pollutant more
frequently than required by the Director using the procedures prescribed
herein, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (f)   Wastewater Metering Requirements.  If water from wells, streams,
reservoirs or other means are used instead of, or in addition to, water from
the municipal water distribution system, properly installed and maintained
waste metering devices shall be installed and operated by the user.  The cost
and installation of such waste metering in the sanitary sewer outlet of the
premises shall be at the owner's or user's expense.  Only waste meters approved
and inspected by the Director shall be permissible.
   (g)   Conflict of Laboratory Results.  In the event that analysis of wastes,
determined by the sampling and gauging of wastes from an industry or user by
the City personnel, does not agree with an analysis of wastes from the industry
or user, submitted by them to the POTW, a program of resampling and regauging,
with subsequent chemical determinations may be instituted as follows:
(1)   The industry or user interested shall submit a request for resampling and
regauging, and subsequent chemical determinations of the wastes.
(2)   The chemist or engineer employed by the industry or user responsible for
the analysis submitted to the POTW shall confer with the Director.  They shall
first agree as to the length of the rerun and to the mediums to be employed to
determine the flow and to sample the flow.
(3)   The chemist or engineer engaged by the industry or user may be present
during the resampling and regauging operation, and also in the POTW laboratory
during the chemical determination of the analysis.
(4)   The results of the analysis, determined from the quantity and quality of
the flow, shall be considered the analysis of the wastes discharged to the
POTW, or to a watercourse, by the industry or user and the sewerage surcharge
or penalties shall be determined from the strength of the wastes as reported in
the analysis.
(5)   In the event an analysis of wastes, determined from the routinely
scheduled sampling and gauging of wastes from an industry or user is not
considered representative because of breakdown or manufacturing processes, or
of treatment or pretreatment facilities during the operation, and such
breakdown or conditions are accepted by the Director as legitimate reasons, the
industry or user can request resampling or regauging of the wastes after the
breakdowns are remedied.  However, the industry or user shall agree to bear all
costs of the resampling and regauging operation, plus the costs of analytical
determinations.  In such cases, the Director shall schedule the operation as
soon as possible, but not to interfere with the rescheduled operations.  All
analytical results so found shall be current and no retroactive refunds shall
be made for any differential in concentration established.
(6)   It shall be assumed by the Director that any industry or user that has
treatment or pretreatment facilities and any routinely scheduled sampling and
gauging operations conducted at any time shall be considered representative. 
If in the course of several routinely scheduled sampling and gauging operations
the industry or user claims that the results of such sampling and gauging are
not representative because of breakdown or other interruption of the treatment
or pretreatment facilities, then the Director shall assume that such facilities
are, in fact not being properly maintained and the results of the sampling and
gauging operations shall be used for purposes of determining the sewerage
surcharge or penalty, fully at the discretion of the Director, until such time
as another routinely-scheduled sampling and gauging operation shall be
conducted.
   (h)   Metering and Gauging Equipment Approval.  All metering and gauging
equipment shall be approved by the Director.  Equipment shall be that currently
used by the City, or its equivalent.
(Ord. 1991-118.  Passed 8-6-91; Ord. 2010-69.  Passed 6-8-10.)
   915.08  RECORDS.
   (a)   Retention.  All users subject to this chapter, shall retain and
preserve for not less than three years any records, books, documents,
memoranda, reports, correspondence documentation associated with Best
Management Practices, and any and all summaries thereof, relating to
monitoring, sampling and chemical analyses made by, or on behalf of, a user in
connection with its discharge.  All records which pertain to matters which are
the subject of administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation
activities brought by the City pursuant hereto shall be retained and preserved
by the user until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of
limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired.
(Ord. 1991-118.  Passed 8-6-91; Ord. 2010-69.  Passed 6-8-10.)
   (b)   Confidential Information.
(1)   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits and monitoring programs, and from inspections,
shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without
restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the City and/or governmental agency that the release of
such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
(2)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secret processes shall not be made available
for inspection by the public, but shall be made available, upon written
request, to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the NPDES
permit, State disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs;
provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by
the State or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the individual furnishing the report.  Wastewater constituents and
characteristics shall not be recognized as confidential information. 
Information accepted by the City as confidential shall not be transmitted to
any governmental agency or to the general public by the City unless ten days'
notification is given to the user.
(Ord. 1991-118.  Passed 8-6-91.)
   915.09  FALSIFYING INFORMATION.
   No person, industry or user shall knowingly made a false statement,
representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or
other document filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter,
or falsify, tamper with, or knowingly render inaccurate, any monitoring device
or method required under this chapter.
(Ord. 1991-118.  Passed 8-6-91.)
   915.10  FAILURE TO REPORT ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   A user shall notify the POTW of an accidental discharge of a prohibited
waste material within one hour of such discharge unto a sewer or waterway.  Any
damage to the sewerage system or wastewater treatment plant caused by any
accidental discharge shall be the liability of the originator of the discharge.
(Ord. 1991-118.  Passed 8-6-91.)
   915.11  PRETREATMENT.
   (a)   Requirements.  Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as

national categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as
specified by the Federal Pretreatment Regulations.  Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the POTW shall be provided,
operated and maintained at the user's expense.  Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
Director of Public Service for review, and shall be acceptable to the City
before construction of the facility.  The review of such plans and operating
procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility, as necessary, to produce an effluent acceptable to the
Director under the provisions of this chapter.  Any subsequent changes in the
pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be
acceptable to, the Director prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
   (b)   Compliance Schedules.  When in the opinion of the Director, it becomes
necessary for industrial users to install technology or provide additional
operation and maintenance (O & M) to meet any condition of this chapter or
applicable administrative order, the Director shall require the development of
the shortest schedule by which the industrial user shall provide this
additional technology or O & M.
(1)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events.  Under no circumstances
shall any increment exceed nine months.
(2)   Not later than fourteen days following each date in the schedule and the
final date for compliance, the trial user shall submit a progress report to the
Director including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment
of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps
being taken to return to the schedule established.
   (c)   Acceptance of Pretreatment Plans.  Plans, specifications and any other
pertinent information relating to treatment or pretreatment facilities, holding
tanks, control or neutralization equipment, or other facilities to be utilized
in the treatment or control of waters and wastes, shall be submitted for
acceptance by the POTW, and no construction of such facilities shall be
commenced until such acceptance is obtained in writing.  All plans shall be
subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (d)   Required Operation of Pretreatment Facilities.  Where such facilities
are provided for treatment, pretreatment, control or neutralization of waters
or waste, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operation by the owner or user at his expense, and shall be subject to
inspection by the Director every six to twelve months, or more often if deemed
necessary by the Director and established in Chapter
913 of the Codified Ordinances.  The user shall maintain operating records and
shall submit to the POTW a monthly report of the character of the influent and
effluent as may be prescribed by the Director to show performance of the
treatment facilities.
(1)   A bypass of the treatment system is prohibited unless all of the
following conditions are met:
A.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage;
B.   There was no feasible alternative to the bypass, including the use of
auxiliary treatment of the wastewater; and
C.   The industrial user properly notified and obtained the approval of the
Director, or a bona fide emergency occurs and the user is unable to contact the
Director.
(2)   Industrial users shall provide immediate notice to the Director upon
discovery of a bypass.
(3)   The Director may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, if it is for essential
maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the user's treatment system. 
Industrial users anticipating a bypass shall submit notice to and obtain the
approval of the Director at least ten days in advance of such bypass.
(4)   A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time
the user becomes aware of the bypass.  The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause, the duration of the bypass (including
exact dates and times and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue), and the steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.  The Director may
waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within twenty-four hours.
(Ord. 1991-118.  Passed 8-6-91.)
   915.12  OPERATION OF PRIVATE TREATMENT FACILITIES.
   Acceptance by the Director of Public Service of existing facilities does
not, in any way guarantee that these facilities shall function in the manner
described by the user; nor shall it relieve the user of the responsibility of
revamping, enlarging, or otherwise modifying such facilities to accomplish the
intended purpose.
(Ord. 1991-118.  Passed 8-6-91.)
   915.13  INTENTIONAL DISCHARGE OF A PROHIBITED WASTE.
   No person or user shall knowingly discharge a prohibited waste or quantity
of waste to the sewer system from a pretreatment facility.  Each such discharge
shall be considered to be a separate offense.

follow-up report thereof shall be filed by the user with the POTW within five
days.  The report shall specify:
   (a)   A description of the upset, the cause thereof, and the upset's impact
on a user's compliance status;
   (b)   The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to be restored; and
   (c)   All steps taken, or to be taken, to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
      (Ord. 1991-118.  Passed 8-6-91; Ord. 2010-69.  Passed 6-8-10.)
   915.15  INTERCEPTORS AND TRAPS.
   Grease, oil and sand interceptor or traps shall be provided where, in the
opinion of the Director of Public Service, they are necessary for the proper
handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any
flammable wastes, sand and other harmful materials.  All interceptor or traps
shall be of a type, capacity and design approved by the Director, and shall be
located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. 
Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors or traps shall be
maintained by the user, at his expense, in continuously effective operation at
all times.
(Ord. 1991-118.  Passed 8-6-91.)
   915.16  CHANGE IN WASTE CHARACTERISTICS.
   All industrial users are required to promptly notify the POTW, in advance,
of any substantial change in volume or character of pollutants in the user's
discharge to the POTW.
(Ord. 1991-118.  Passed 8-6-91.)
   915.17  WPCC APPEAL BOARD.
   (a)   Appointment and Term.  A WPCC Appeal Board shall be appointed to hear
appeals from any decisions or actions taken on matters concerning
interpretation and execution of the provisions of this chapter.  The Board
shall consist of the mayors of the cities of Eastlake and Willoughby or their
designates, plus a third member jointly agreed upon by the mayors of both
cities.  If the mayors are unable to agree upon such third person, then the
Mayor of the City of Willoughby shall select an individual whose term shall be
for a period of one year; and thereafter the Mayor of the City of Eastlake
shall appoint the third person for a one-year term.  An individual appointed to
the Board by joint agreement of the Mayors shall serve for a term of two-years
from the date of appointment.
   (b)   Required Quorum.  At no time shall a hearing of the Appeal Board be
held unless there are three members present, which number constitutes a
quorum.  A meeting shall be held at the request of the Board Chairman whenever
the need calls for it.
   (c)   Right to Appeal.  Within ten days following any order pertaining to
any provision of this chapter, an appeal may be filed, in writing, with the
Appeal Board.  In the event that such an appeal is filed, the Board shall hear
such appeal within thirty days from and after its date of filing with the

pretreatment requirements.  For the purposes of this provision, an industrial
user is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets the criteria of
Section
915.18(c), (d) and (h).  A significant industrial user is in signifant
noncompliance if its violation meets any of the following criteria:
   (a)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as

during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit or
the average limit for the same pollutant parameter including instantaneous
limits;
   (b)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of all of the measurements for each
pollutant parameter taken at any permitted monitoring point during a six-month
period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or
requirement including instantaneous limits, multiplied by the applicable TRC
(TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants
except pH);
   (c)   Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum or
longer term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the
Director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass through (including endangering the health of POTW
personnel or the general public);
   (d)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment of
human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's
exercise of emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   (e)   Failure to meet, within ninety days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction or
attaining final compliance;

required reports such as Baseline Monitoring Reports, ninety day compliance
reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with
compliance schedules; or any other reports required by the Director;
   (g)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   (h)   Any other violation or group of violations, including a violation of
BMPs,  which the Director determines will or has adversely affected the
operation or implementation of the POTW's pretreatment program.

excluding lateral connections, installed showing thereby that:  the sewer
system has been constructed upon a sound engineering basis, it is free of any
and all accumulations of foreign substances, is of sound workmanship, and that
the passage of, and flow of, sanitary sewage is free and clear.  If, in the
discretion of the City Engineer, the sewers are large enough for a visual
inspection to be made, in lieu of photographs, such a visual inspection shall
be made and a report of such inspection submitted to the Director of Public
Service as a permanent record.
   (b)   The City Engineer, upon inspection of such photographs or visual
inspection reports, if satisfied that:  such sewer is free and clear of all
foreign substances, is of sound workmanship, and that there is nothing present
to prevent free flow of sewage is hereby authorized to approve the same as a
final inspection; placing in safekeeping all photographs or inspection reports
for future reference by the City.
   (c)   The cost of such photographing, photographs or inspection reports
shall be paid for entirely by the contractor or developer of such land or sewer
system, and such photographs or inspection reports shall remain the property of
the City.
   (d)   The Mayor and/or the Director are hereby authorized to engage the
services of any person, firm or corporation specializing in the televising or

desirable, then, at the request of the abutting private property owner, the
City may furnish to such private property owner a tree from those enumerated in
subsection (a) hereof to be planted in the front lawn of the private property
by the owner.  If it is determined that the planting could interfere with
existing utilities or create other unique planting problems, the City may
undertake to plant such trees at the request of the private property owner.
Planting shall be permitted in tree lawns that are from twelve feet or greater
in depth, consistent with this section.
(Ord. 2009-8.  Passed 2-3-09.)
   943.06  PERMIT REQUIRED.
   Any person, firm, or entity who wants to plant, remove, destroy, cut, prune,
fertilize, treat, break, climb, injure or spray any tree existing on any public
place in the City, or authorize or procure any person to do so, or remove or
tamper with any device whatsoever placed for the protection of such tree, or
authorize or cause the same to be done shall obtain a permit from the Director
of Pubic Service on a form adopted for such use by the Director.
   Such permit, when granted for the planting of any tree to be located on any
public place in the City, shall designate the species of tree to be planted,
the required spacing and the required minimum planting size, as specified in
the Master Street Tree Plan for the City in effect January 1, 2009, or as
amended from time to time.
(Ord. 2009-8.  Passed 2-3-09.)
   943.07  PLACING DELETERIOUS SUBSTANCES NEAR TREES.
   No person shall permit any natural or artificial gas, salt, brine, water,
oil, liquid dye or any other substances deleterious to trees to come in contact
with the soil surrounding the roots of any tree upon any public place in the
City which would, in the judgment of the Director of Public Service or his
designee, kill, injure, deface, destroy or affect the growth of such trees.
(Ord. 2009-8.  Passed 2-3-09.)
   943.08  PROHIBITING STONE OR CONCRETE ON GROUND ADJACENT TO TREE TRUNK.
   No person shall place or maintain upon the ground in any public place any
stone, concrete, brick or other impervious material or substance that would, in
the judgment of the Director of Public Service or his designee, obstruct the
free access of air and water to the roots or any tree upon any public place in
the City, unless authorized by the Director or his designee.  There shall be
maintained around the base of the trunk of each such tree at least nine square
feet of open ground for a tree three inches in diameter, and for every two
inches or increase of such diameter there shall be an increase of at least one
square foot of open ground. Open ground must be mulched with a two to three
inch depth of shredded oak bark or other natural aged mulch and shall not be in
contact with the trunk of said tree.
(Ord. 2009-8.  Passed 2-3-09.)
   943.09  CARE OF TREES DURING BUILDING OPERATION AND CONSTRUCTION ON PUBLIC
LAND OR PLACES.
   During construction, existing trees must be protected in the following
manner:
   (a)   Protective fencing must be provided with an access gate at the
Critical Root Zone of protected trees and approved in place by the Director or
his designee prior to construction or demolition.
   (b)   Critical Root Zone must be watered regularly if rainfall of 1 inch per
week does not occur during the months of April through October.
   (c)   No construction staging or disposal of construction materials or by-
products including concrete washings, paint, plaster, or chemical solutions is
allowed in the Critical Root Zone.
   (d)   Critical Root Zone should not be subjected to flooding incidental to
the construction work.
   (e)   All work conducted in the ground within the Critical Root Zone of any
protected tree should be accomplished with hand tools, unless an air spade is
used. Trenches in the Critical Root Zone should be tunneled or completed with
an air spade to avoid damage to small feeder roots within the Critical Root
Zone.
   (f)   Where structural footings are required and major roots (over 3 inches
in diameter) will be impacted, the engineer of record should submit acceptable
footing design alternatives and/or location alternatives to the Director before
proceeding.
   (g)   Any required trenching should be routed in such a manner as to
minimize root damage. Radial trenching (radial to tree trunk) is preferred as
it is less harmful than tangential trenching. Construction activity should be
diverted from the Critical Root Zone. Cutting of roots should be avoided, i.e.
the placement of pipes and cables below uncut roots. Whenever possible, and in
accordance with applicable code requirements, the same trench should be used
for multiple utilities.
   (h)   Natural or preconstruction grade should be maintained in the Critical
Root Zone. Soil should not be in contact with the trunk of the tree above the
Basal Flare at any time, during or after construction
   (i)   In areas where the grade around the protected tree will be lowered,
some root cutting may be unavoidable. Cuts should be clean and made at right
angles to the roots. When practical, cut roots back to a branching lateral
root.
   (j)   When removing existing pavement in the Critical Root Zone, avoid the
use of heavy equipment which will compact and damage the root system.
   (k)   Mulching materials and methods will be defined by the Director.
   (l)     Pruning of trees should be in accordance with TCIA standards for
pruning.
      (Ord. 2009-8.  Passed 2-3-09.)
   943.10  MOVING OF TREES.
   All moving of trees upon any public place in the City made necessary by the
moving of a building, structure, or any other private enterprise shall be done
under the supervision of, and with the written permission of, the Director of
Public Service, and at the expense of the applicant or person seeking the
removal of such tree. Such applicant, as one of the conditions to obtaining
such permission, shall deposit with the City a sum in cash as the Director may
determine necessary to cover the cost of moving and replacing such tree if the
conditions of such permission require the replacement thereof.  However, in
lieu of such cash deposit the Director may, in his discretion, accept a good
and sufficient bond in like amount conditioned upon the payment of the cost of
moving and replacing such tree.
(Ord. 2009-8.  Passed 2-3-09.)
   943.11  TRIMMING OF TREES.
   The Director of Public Service shall keep all trees situated upon any public
place in the City trimmed so that the projection of tree branches over any
public sidewalk, private driveway, or into any public street beyond the curb
line will not conflict with the intended use of the public place.  (Ord. 2009-
8.  Passed 2-3-09.)
   943.12  TRIMMING OF TREES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   All trees standing upon private property in the City having branches which
project into public highways or public places shall be kept trimmed by the
owner or occupant of such private property to such an extent that the lowest
branches of such trees shall not come within nine feet of the ground of any
public sidewalk or right-of-way. Branches over the public highway must be
maintained at a fourteen foot (14') clearance minimum.
(Ord. 2009-8.  Passed 2-3-09.)
943.13   TRIMMING OF TREES NOT INVOLVING PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   No owner or occupant of any premises shall permit a tree to stand near
a dwelling or structure on adjacent property which will endanger the dwelling
or structure of the users or occupants of the adjacent property should all or
part of the tree fall.
   (b)   The Service Director upon receipt of a complaint and/or upon lawful
inspection of any premise shall cause the tree to be inspected by a
professional arborist, who shall prepare and present to the Service Director, a
basic tree risk assessment.
(Ord. 2017-116.  Passed 12-5-17.)
   (c)   If the Service Director, after a review of the Arborist assessment and
a visual inspection of the tree or trees, finds it necessary to order the
trimming, preservation, or removal of trees or plants upon private property, as
authorized in Section
943.03, a written order shall be served upon the owner, tenant, occupant or
other person responsible for its existence to correct the dangerous condition. 
Any required removal of trees or plants shall be completed so that the
remaining tree or plant remnant shall not exceed a maximum height of eighteen
(18) inches above ground level, as measured from the tree or plant base.
(Ord. 2018-59.  Passed 5-15-18.)
      (1)   Method of service.  The order required herein shall be served in
one of the following ways:
         A.   By personally serving a copy of the order to the occupant of the
property, and if the owner is not the occupant, by personally serving the
owner.
         B.   By affixing a copy of the order to the door at the entrance of
the premises in violation, and mailing a copy of the order to the address as
shown on the Lake County Tax Duplicate.
         C.   By mailing a copy of the order as shown on the Lake County Tax
Duplicate to the last known address of the owner of the premises, by registered
mail.
      (2)   Time for compliance.  The order required herein shall set forth a
time limit for compliance, dependent upon the hazard and danger created by the
violation.  In cases of extreme danger to persons or public property, the
Service Director shall have the authority to require compliance immediately
upon service of the order.
      (3)   Appeal from order.  A person to whom an order is directed, or his
designee, shall have the right, within twenty-four hours of the service of such
order, to appeal to the Mayor of the City.  The Mayor, or his designee, shall
review such order within seven days and file his decision.  Unless the order is
revoked or modified, it shall remain in full force and be obeyed by the person
to whom directed.  No person to whom an order is directed shall fail to comply
with such order within seven days after an appeal has been determined.
      (4)   Failure to comply.  When a person to whom an order is directed
fails to comply within the specified time, the Service Director shall remedy
the condition or contract with others for such purpose and charge the cost
thereof, including administrative costs, to the person or persons to whom the
order is directed.
      (5)   The person or entity hired by the City to remedy the condition
shall secure written permission of the owner to enter upon the premises to
remedy the condition.  If the owner refuses permission to enter, the person or
entity shall take the necessary steps to secure permission from the Willoughby
Municipal Court, or any court that has jurisdiction, to enter upon the
premises.
      (6)   Special assessment.  If the cost of remedying a condition,
including the charge for the arborist’s services, is not paid within thirty
(30) days after receipt of a statement from the Service Director, such cost
shall be levied against the property upon which such hazard existed, as a
special assessment.  The Director of Finance shall certify such expenses and
costs to the Auditor of Lake County with the request that such amount be
entered upon the tax duplicate and become a lien upon such lands, from and
after the date of the entry, and be collected as other taxes and returned to
the City according to law.  (Ord. 2017-116.  Passed 12-5-17.)

   1101.02  PURPOSES.
   This Planning  and Zoning Code is adopted to promote and protect the public
health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and/or general welfare of the
inhabitants of the City by regulating the use of buildings, other structures
and land for residential, business, service, industrial, institutional, public
or other uses; by relating the area and dimensions of lots, yards and other
open spaces; by regulating and restricting the location, bulk, height, design
and land coverage of buildings; by regulating and limiting the density of
population, and for the aforesaid purposes to establish districts of such
classification, number and dimensions as may be considered best to implement
comprehensive planning; to regulate the subdividing and development of land;
and to provide regulations and procedures for the administration,
interpretation, amendment and enforcement of this Planning and Zoning Code.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1101.03  OBJECTIVES.
   It is intended that the provisions of this Planning and Zoning Code shall be
applied to achieve the following objectives:
(a)   To protect the character and values of the residential, business,
service, industrial, institutional and public uses and to assure their orderly
and beneficial development; and to discourage premature, uneconomical or
scattered divisions.
(b)   To provide adequate open spaces for light and air, to prevent
overcrowding of the land, to prevent excessive concentration of population and,
conversely, to prevent sparse and uncoordinated development and discourage
premature, uneconomical or scattered subdivisions.
(c)   To ensure safe and convenient traffic circulation, both vehicular and
pedestrian.
(d)   To improve the public safety and to lessen congestion by locating
buildings and uses in relation to streets so as to cause the least interference
with and be damaged least by traffic movements;
(e)   To provide for adequate yet economical provisions for public facilities,
utilities and services such as water supply, sewer system and transportation
systems, as well as recreation, schools and other public facilities, in order
to conserve public funds.
(f)   To conserve the natural resources of the City;
(g)   To ensure the accurate surveying of land and recording of plats; and
(h)   To encourage the most appropriate uses of the land and guide the future
development of the City in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan.

   1101.04  RELATIONSHIP TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
   It is the intention of Council that this Planning and Zoning Code implement
the planning policies reflected in the Comprehensive Plan and other planning
documents.  While Council reaffirms its commitment that this Code, and any

document.

forth herein and the purposes and intent of each district as set forth in each
district chapter.

building or use shall not be considered as providing any part of the required
lot area for another building or use.

   1109.01  PURPOSE.
   In order to accomplish the purposes for which this Code is adopted, it is
essential that its regulations be soundly and consistently applied, and that
this Code be vigorously administered. This chapter stipulates the procedures to
be followed in obtaining zoning permits, including conditional use permits.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1109.02  ZONING PERMIT REQUIRED.
   Excavations or site improvements shall not be started, or buildings or
structures shall not be erected, moved, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged,
or structurally altered until a zoning permit has been applied for and issued
by the Building and Zoning Inspector, except as otherwise specifically provided
for in this Code.
   A zoning permit shall be issued only when:
   (a)   The Building and Zoning Inspector finds that, for a one-family or two-

the Planning Commission.
   (h)   Planning Commission Determination. In approving a development plan,
the Planning Commission shall find that:

      (8)   If the project is to be carried out in progressive stages, each
stage shall be so planned that the foregoing conditions are complied with at
the completion of each stage.
   (i)   Action by Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall either:
      (1)   Approve the development plan as submitted; or
      (2)   Approve the plan subject to specific conditions not included in the

layout, open space arrangement, on-site control of access to streets or such
features as fences, walls and plantings to further protect and improve the
proposed and surrounding developments; or
      (3)   Deny the development plan. If the Commission finds that a proposed
plan does not meet the purposes of these regulations, it shall deny the plan
and shall submit its findings in writing, to the applicant, upon the
applicant's request.
         Failure of the Planning Commission to act within sixty days from the
date the application was deemed complete, or an extended period as may be
agreed upon, shall at the election of the applicant be deemed a denial of the
final development plan.
   (j)   Environmental Assessment Statement. Prior to the approval of a
proposed development plan, the Planning Commission shall consider all comments
and/or recommendations regarding the Environmental Assessment Statement as
provided in Section
1109.12(f).
   (k)   Significance of an Approved Plan: Plan Revisions. An approved
development plan shall become for the proposed development a binding commitment
of the specific elements approved for development. The approved development
plan may be transferred to another person, corporation, or group of individuals
or corporations prior to the issuance of a building permit. Such a transfer
shall occur only upon approval of the Planning Commission. A request for such a
transfer or change of ownership shall be presented to the Planning Commission
and granted only if the new ownership entity satisfies the administrative,
financial, legal and all other performance guarantees approved with the
original development plan. All construction and development under any building
permit shall be in accordance with the approved plan. Any departure from such
plan shall be cause for revocation of the zoning certificate. Any changes in an
approved plan shall be resubmitted for approval in accordance with this
section.
   (l)   Lapse of Approval. An approved plan shall remain valid for a period of
twelve months following the date of its approval or for some other period so
specified by Planning Commission. If at the end of that time construction has
not begun, then such plan shall be considered as having lapsed and shall be of
no effect unless resubmitted and reapproved by the Planning Commission.
Construction is deemed to have begun when all necessary excavation and piers or
footings of one or more principal buildings included in the plan shall have
been completed. 
      (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1109.05  CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   When a proposed use is permitted in a zoning district as a conditional use
as set forth in the district regulations, a conditional use permit is required
and the application for such conditional use permit shall be submitted and
reviewed according to the following:
   (a)   Designation as a Conditional Use.
      (1)   Certain types of uses are classified as conditional uses because of
their uncommon or unique characteristics, infrequency of occurrence, large area
requirements, or potential for significant impact on a particular district.
Consequently, the conditional use procedures call for a more flexible and
equitable procedure for properly accommodating such activities in the
community. The forces that influence decisions regarding the nature, magnitude
and location of such types of land use activities are many and varied,
depending upon functional characteristics, competitive situations, and the
availability of land. The purpose of this section is to provide controllable
and reasonably flexible requirements for certain kinds of uses that will allow
practicable latitude for the investor, but that will, at the same time,
maintain adequate provisions for the health, safety, convenience and general
welfare of the City's inhabitants.
      (2)   In order to accomplish such a dual objective, this Section sets
forth a review procedure that enables a more detailed consideration of each
conditional use in regards to the proposed conditions of location, design,
size, operation, intensity of use, generation of noise, lighting, traffic and
traffic movement, concentration of population, processes and equipment
employed, and amount and kinds of public facilities and services required,
together with many other factors. Review of this information by the Planning
Commission is required to ensure that each proposed conditional use is
consistent with the intent and objectives of the particular district in which
it is to be located.
   (b)   Submission of Application. The owner, or agent thereof, of property
for which such conditional use is proposed shall file with the Building and
Zoning Inspector an application for a conditional use permit accompanied by
payment of the required fee established by Council. The application for a
conditional use permit shall disclose all uses proposed for the development,
their location, extent and characteristics and shall include a development plan
and associated documentation as required in Section
1109.04(b) unless specific items required in Section
1109.04(b) are determined by the Building and Zoning Inspector to be
inapplicable or unnecessary and are waived in writing by the Building and
Zoning Inspector.
   (c)   Review for Completeness. The Building and Zoning Inspector shall
review the application for completeness with the submission requirements prior
to the application being placed on the agenda of the Planning Commission.
   (d)   Distribution of Application. The application shall be transmitted to
the Planning Commission as well as other agencies as follows:
      (1)   The application may be transmitted to appropriate administrative
departments and professional consultants for review and comment.
      (2)   All applications requiring review of an Environmental Assessment
Statement according to subsection
1109.05(a) shall be transmitted to Council and other appropriate administrative
departments as set forth in Section
1109.12 for review and evaluation of the EAS.
      (3)   Any department reports, comments or expert opinions shall be
compiled by the Building and Zoning Inspector and transmitted to the Planning
Commission prior to the time of the Commission's review.  All reports and the
complete application shall be submitted to the Planning Commission not less
than 16 days prior to the meeting at which the application is to be reviewed.
   (e)   Public Hearing and Notice by Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing on the application. Notice of such
public hearing shall be given by first class mail or email to the property
owners within 300 feet of the proposed use and further notice shall be given in
one or more newspapers of general circulation in the City at least 10 days
before the date of said public hearing. All notices shall set forth the time
and place of the public hearing and the nature of the proposed conditional use.
Failure of delivery of such notice shall not invalidate action taken on such
application.
   (f)   Review Criteria. The Planning Commission shall review the proposed
conditional use, as presented on the submitted plans and specifications, to
determine whether or not the proposed use is appropriate and in keeping with
the purpose and intent of this Planning and Zoning Code and with the criteria
set forth below.
      (1)   A conditional use, and uses accessory to such conditional use, may
be permitted in a district only when specified as a conditional use in such
district.
      (2)   General Criteria for All Conditional Uses.  The Planning Commission
shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each proposed use in
terms of the following standards and shall find adequate evidence that:
         A.   The conditional use in the proposed location will be harmonious
and in accordance with the purpose, intent and basic planning objectives of
this code and with the objectives for the district in which located and with
the Comprehensive Plan;
         B.   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional
use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety or general
welfare;
         C.   The conditional use will be designed, constructed, operated and
maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the
existing or intended character of the general vicinity, and that such use will
not essentially change the character of the same area;
         D.   The hours of operation of the proposed use are similar to a use
permitted in the district.
         E.   The conditional use will not be hazardous or disturbing to the
existing and future use and enjoyment of property in the immediate vicinity for
the uses permitted, nor substantially diminish or impair property values within
the neighborhood;
         F.   The establishment of the conditional use in the proposed location
will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the
surrounding property for uses permitted in the district;
         G.   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
         H.   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress designed to minimize traffic congestion on the surrounding public
streets;
         I.   The establishment of the conditional use should not be
detrimental to the economic welfare of the community by creating excessive
additional requirements at public cost for public facilities such as police,
fire and schools;
         J.   There is minimal potential for future hardship on the conditional
use that could result from the proposed use being surrounded by uses permitted
by right that may be incompatible;
         K.   The design and arrangement of circulation aisles, parking areas,
and access drives shall be in compliance with the regulations set forth in
Chapter
1161 and shall provide for interconnecting circulation among adjacent parcels.
         L.   If the conditional use is proposed in a residential district, the
proposed use would generate only a minimum of traffic through a residential
neighborhood if located on a local street.
      (3)   Conformance with District and Use-Specific Regulations. A
conditional use shall conform to regulations of the district in which it is
located, and to other substantive requirements of this Planning and Zoning
Code, as well as satisfy the conditions, standards and requirements of Chapter
1155. In the event there is a difference between the provisions of the district
regulations and the use-specific regulations, the provisions of Chapter
1155 shall prevail, unless clearly indicated differently in the regulations.
      (4)   In addition, the Planning Commission shall review the development
plan for the proposed conditional use according to the development plan review
procedures set forth in Section
1109.04(g).
      (5)   The Commission may require such additional information as deemed
necessary, including the carrying out of special studies and the provisions of
expert advice.
   (g)   Action by Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall take one
of the following actions:
      (1)   If the proposed conditional use is determined by the Planning
Commission to be appropriate, the Planning Commission shall approve the
conditional use application. As part of the approval, the Planning Commission
may prescribe appropriate conditions, stipulations, safeguards and limitations
on the duration of the use as it may deem necessary and in conformance with the
intent and purposes of this Code for the protection of individual property
rights and the public health, safety, and general welfare of the community and
ensuring that the intent and objective of this Planning and Zoning Code are
observed.
      (2)   If the proposed use is found to be not in compliance with the
specifications of this Planning and Zoning Code, or not appropriate to or in
keeping with the purpose, policies and intent of the Comprehensive Plan, the
Planning Commission shall reject the application.
      Failure of the Planning Commission to act within sixty days from the date
the application was deemed complete, or an extended period as may be agreed
upon, shall at the election of the applicant be deemed a denial of the
application.
   (h)   Environmental Assessment Statement. Prior to the approval of a
conditional use permit, the Planning Commission shall  consider all comments
and/or recommendations regarding the Environmental Assessment Statement as
provided in Section
1109.12(f).
   (i)   Terms and Duration of Conditional Use Permit. A conditional use permit
shall be deemed to authorize a particular conditional use on a specific parcel
for which it was approved. The conditional use permit is nonassignable and
shall expire one year from the date of enactment, unless substantial progress
is accomplished or as otherwise specifically approved by Planning Commission.
The breach of any condition, safeguard or requirement shall automatically
invalidate the conditional use permit granted, and shall constitute a violation
of the Planning and Zoning Code. Such violation shall be punishable as per
Section
1113.04. A conditional use
      permit issued pursuant to this section shall be valid only to the
applicant to whom the permit is issued, unless a transfer of such permit has
been approved by the Building and Zoning Inspector.
   (j)   Reapplication. An application for a conditional use permit which has
been denied wholly or in part by the Planning Commission and is resubmitted to
the Planning Commission shall comply with all the requirements of this section,
including payment of the required fee.  (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1109.06  MINOR SUBDIVISIONS/LOT SPLIT AND LOT LINE ADJUSTMENTS.

an existing public street and does not involve the opening, widening, extension
or improvement of any street or the installation of any underground public
utility, and does not involve more than five lots and does include all the
contiguous land under one ownership, shall be classified as a minor
subdivision, also referred to as a lot split. 
   (b)   Lot Line Adjustment Application. 
      (1)   An application for a lot line adjustment as defined in this code
and not otherwise classified as a subdivision shall include a metes and bounds
legal description and a survey drawing and be submitted to the Building and

1109.06(b)(2), then the Building and Zoning Inspector shall not approve the
application and shall state the conditions that must be complied with before it
will be approved. 
   (c)   Minor Subdivision/Lot Split Application. An application for a minor
subdivision/lot split and sketch plat, complying with the requirements set
forth in subsection (c) hereof shall be prepared for each minor subdivision or
lot split and submitted to the Secretary of the Planning Commission not less
than thirteen days before the Planning Commission's next regularly scheduled
meeting. The purposes of a sketch plat layout are to furnish sufficient
information for determination of proper integration of the subdivision with the
neighborhood and compliance with City codes. The Planning Commission shall take
action at the next regularly scheduled meeting.
   (d)   Sketch Plat. The developer shall furnish with the application for
approval of a sketch plat for a minor subdivision or lot split the following:
      (1)   Maps and data.
         A.   Location. A drawing or print of a City map, or a part thereof,
showing the location of the proposed subdivision; and
         B.   Property. A drawing or print showing by scale and dimensions the
parcel which is to be subdivided and all contiguous land of the same ownership,
including locations of existing structures within fifty feet of the boundaries.
         C.   Topography. Information on the topography and drainage of the
proposed subdivision and within fifty feet thereof; and
         D.   Utilities. Information on the accessibility of required
utilities; and
         E.   Names of the owner and of adjoining property owners, including
designations of the parcel according to official records.
      (2)   Sketch plat. The sketch plat shall be clearly drawn on transparent
paper or cloth at a scale of not less than fifty feet to the inch showing the
proposed layout and dimensions of each lot.
   (e)   Approval.  If the Commission determines the proposed division of land
is a minor subdivision or lot split, and:
      (1)   That all the contiguous land owned by the proposed developer will
therein be completely subdivided, and
      (2)   That it is properly integrated with adjoining developments or could
be properly coordinated with the subdivision and extension of streets to
adjoining land, and
      (3)   That it complies with the planning principles and other sections of
these regulations, the Zoning and other Codes and plans of the City, and
      (4)   If the layout is satisfactory and all maps, plans and data as set
forth in subsection (c) hereof, then the sketch plat shall be approved.
      (5)   A notation to that effect shall be made on the sketch plat by the
Chairman and the Secretary of the Commission and the developer shall be
informed if a metes and bounds deed description or a plat map will be required.
Three prints of the approved sketch plat shall be made for the Commission by
the developer.
   (f)   If Not Approved. If the Commission determines it is a major
subdivision or the sketch plat is not approved for other reasons, the
Commission shall state the conditions that shall be complied with before it
will be approved.
   (g)   Recording the Minor Subdivision or Lot Split. After approval of a
sketch plat, the developer shall submit either a metes and bounds, deed
description, and/or plat as required, to the City Engineer for review. The
metes and bounds, deed description, and/or plat shall conform to all applicable
County and State standards. If the same is found to conform to the approved
sketch plat and is otherwise satisfactory to the Engineer, he shall so certify
his approval thereon within seven working days after receipt. The approval
shall expire within 120 days unless the deed or plat has been filed and
recorded in the office of the County Recorder and the Commission has been so
notified by the developer in writing. (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1109.07  MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   Procedures are herein established and intended to define the steps by which
an applicant may design, make an application, record plats and construct
improvements in the development of land, and by which the Commission may
review, make recommendations for and approve the plans and otherwise administer
these regulations.
   (a)   Sketch plat. For subdivisions where public utilities are not
accessible at the site or where rezoning is also involved in the project, the
developer may submit, as an exploratory step, a sketch plat and a program for
improvements without all of the maps, data and plans as set forth in subsection
(b) hereof and, if tentatively approved by the Commission, he may proceed then
with the preliminary plats as otherwise required herein. However, no action
shall be taken at such a meeting and no discussions, opinions, suggestions, or
recommendations of the Planning Commission shall be relied upon by the
applicant to indicate subsequent approval or disapproval by the Planning
Commission.
   (b)   Preliminary plat. The purpose of the preliminary plat shall be to
explore the best design for the subdivision, the best relationship to adjoining
subdivisions or undeveloped land, to outline a program of improvements and to
obtain the advice, suggestions and recommendations of the Commission and
departments of the City before the subdivision becomes fixed as in a detailed
drawing.
      (1)   Compliance with zoning standards and planning and design
principles. The proposed subdivision shall be planned in accordance with the
zoning standards set forth in Title Three and the planning and design
principles set forth in Title Five of these regulations.
      (2)   Application and submission requirements. The developer shall
furnish a written application, the preliminary plat, and accompanying maps and
data complying with the requirements set forth below, indicating the existing
conditions of the site, all of which shall be submitted to the Secretary of the
Commission for each proposed major subdivision not less than sixteen days prior
to the meeting at which the application is to be reviewed.
         A.   Plat Preparation. The subdivision shall be designed and drawn by
a registered architect, engineer, land surveyor, landscape architect or
professional planner. The preliminary plat shall be accurately drawn at a scale
of not less than 100 feet to one inch, and shall include a graphic scale, north
arrow, date and title. It may be drawn in pencil on transparent paper.
         B.   Preliminary Plat. The drawing shall include the following:
            1.   The layout, right-of-way and pavement widths, approximate
grades and names of proposed streets and abutting existing streets, including
the location of pavements and sidewalks;
            2.   The location, width and purpose of all other public right- of-
ways and easements;
            3.   The approximate dimensions and number of lots; and each lot's
proposed use.
            4.   Sites to be reserved or dedicated for parks, playgrounds or
other public uses;
            5.   Existing structures on the parcel and within fifty feet of
adjoining property, and proposed building setback lines.
            6.   The bearings and distances of the parcel to be subdivided; and
            7.   Contours at two-foot intervals based on the county datum plane
and showing the approximate direction and gradient of the ground slope on
immediately adjacent land; the subsurface condition of the tract if not
typical; and the watercourses, marshes, wooded areas, isolated preservable
trees and other significant features. This map may be compiled by
photogrammetric methods.
         C.   Location map of the City or part thereof, showing thereon the
location of the proposed subdivision and the relationship to adjacent
development and all community facilities which serve or influence it.
         D.   Utility map showing utilities on and adjacent to the tract,
including the water and gas mains and the location of fire hydrants and
electric power and telephone poles.
         E.   Titles and certificates indicating present parcel designations
according to official records, the name of the developer, the name and address
of the owners, certification of a registered surveyor, the scale and the date
of the survey.
         F.   Protective Covenants. An outline of the protective covenants
proposed to regulate and protect the development.
         G.   Other Preliminary Drawings. The Commission may require additional
preliminary drawings showing information such as street profiles and grades, a
typical cross section of the proposed roadway, proposed sanitary and storm
sewers and water service, or the prospective street system of adjacent land
owned by the developer.
         H.   Ownership Certificate. The Commission may require a certificate
as to ownership and that the proposed subdivision is satisfactory to the owner.
      (3)   Notification of Commission Meeting. The Commission shall notify by
letter the owners, as shown upon the current records of the County Recorder, of
adjoining unsubdivided land at least ten days before the meeting at which the
proposed subdivision is to be considered.
      (4)   Review by Others. For all subdivisions which are of such scope or
at such locations as to affect the design of an integrated neighborhood street
pattern, extensions to adjoining unsubdivided land, public sites, unusual
topographic or other conditions, the Commission may obtain an analysis and
recommendation from a professional planner, civil engineer or landscape
architect who is experienced in the type of subdivision under consideration and
who has no interest in the proposed subdivision. The Commission shall review
any analysis requested or otherwise determine if the preliminary plat embraces
all the applicable planning principles and other provisions of these
regulations as well as other codes of the City.
      (5)   Planning Commission Action. The Planning Commission shall review
the preliminary plat according to the procedures set forth for conditional uses
in Sections
1109.05(c) through
1109.05(h).
      (6)   Effect of Approval. The approval of the preliminary plat shall
assure the developer for a one-year period from the date of approval:
         A.   That the general layout of streets, lots and other features are
approved and that the preliminary plat shall be the basis for the preparation
of the final plat;
         B.   That the general terms and any special conditions under which the
approval of the preliminary plat was granted shall not be changed; and
         C.   That the developer may submit drawings and specifications for
improvements and a final plat for the whole or part of the subdivision for
final approval.
   (c)   Final Plat. Following the approval of the preliminary plat, the owner,
subdivider or agent shall prepare for record purposes, and for dedication of
public streets and other public places, a final plat of the proposed
subdivision.
      (1)   Application and Submission Requirements. An application for
approval of a final plat shall be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the

      (2)   Review by City Engineer. The Secretary of the Commission shall
transmit two prints of each drawing and the specifications to the City Engineer
who shall determine whether or not:
         A.   The final plat conforms to the approved preliminary plats and any
special conditions or modification stipulated; he shall also determine the
correctness of mathematical data and computations; and
         B.   The designs and details of the required improvements as shown on

            One copy of each shall be returned to the Commission within ten
days indicating his determinations.
      (3)   Review by Law Director. The Law Director shall review the financial
guarantees required for the installation and maintenance of the improvements.
      (4)   Staged Development. The developer may apply for final plat approval
of only that section of an approved preliminary plat of a subdivision which he
proposes to develop and/or record as the first stage. However, the preliminary
approval of any section shall become null and void if an application for final
plat approval is not submitted within one year after approval of the
preliminary plat, unless an extension of time is granted by the Commission. In
the event the developer needs to install improvements required for development
phases beyond the phase for which final plat approval is requested, the
Planning Commission may conditionally approve the final plat for a particular
phase and permit the installation of the required improvements before approval
of the final plat for subsequent phases is granted.
      (5)   Action by the Commission. If the Engineer determines that the final
plat, drawings and specifications are satisfactory in regard to the aforesaid
provisions and if the subdivision complies with all other applicable provisions
of these regulations, the Commission shall approve it. Action shall be taken
within forty-five days after the meeting at which the application for approval
and all required plats, maps and data were submitted to the Commission or
within a mutually agreed upon extension; otherwise the final plat shall be
deemed to have been approved. In the event of disapproval of a final plat by
the Planning Commission, the reason(s) for disapproval shall be stated in the
records of the Commission.
         The Commission shall act upon the final plat and/or drawings and
specifications, either separately or concurrently, and upon approval, submit a
recommendation to Council to accept the final plat.
      (6)   Form of Approval. The approval of the final plat shall be indicated
by a certification to that effect on the original mylar of the plat with the
signature of the Secretary of the Commission. The Commission shall obtain three
duplicates thereof at the developer's expense.
      (7)   Council Action. Upon notification by the Commission of the
Commission's approval of the final plat, the Council shall legislatively accept
or reject such final plat. Council's acceptance shall be indicated by the
signature of the Clerk of Council, the ordinance number and include date of
passage.
         The approval of the drawings and specifications for the required
improvements shall be indicated by a certification to that effect on the
original drawings and specifications with the signature of the City Engineer.
Approval of the financial guarantees shall be indicated by certification to
that effect on the original drawings and specifications with the signature of
the Law Director.
      (8)   Recording. The City, upon recommendation by the Planning Commission
shall cause the approved final plat to be filed in the office of the County
Recorder. The costs incurred in filing the plat shall be the obligation of the
developer. If the final plat is revised in any manner after Planning Commission
approval, such approval shall be null and void.
      (9)   Effect of Approval and Recording. If drawings and specifications
for improvements are approved and construction guaranteed, the final plat may
be approved and recorded, construction of improvements started, building
permits issued and lots sold, leased or transferred.
      (10)   Occupancy Permits. Occupancy permits for a building shall not be
issued until streets and utilities are accepted by the City for public use.
However, a temporary occupancy certificate may be issued upon condition that
the developer assumes all responsibility for maintenance of streets and
utilities until officially accepted by the City.
   (d)   Dedication for Public Use. If the final plat indicates land for public
use, the plat shall be submitted to Council for acceptance of the dedication of
any public land or public improvement and acceptance of any easement before it
is recorded. After construction of the public improvements and the Engineer's
review of the "as built" drawings of same, the City may accept any offer of
dedication of any land area, street or utility for public use and maintenance.
The acceptance shall be by separate action of Council.
   (e)   Resubdividing or Vacation. An application for resubdividing,
replatting or vacation of a subdivision shall be made by the owner or owners
thereof to the Commission in the same form as for an original subdivision along
with all required maps and other information. The original lots shall be shown
by dotted lines and lot numbers and other references made to previously
recorded subdivisions. If approved by the Commission, those types of replatting
and vacation actions as required by the provisions of Ohio R.C. 711.17 to
711.31, inclusive, shall be submitted to the Clerk of the Court of Common
Pleas.  (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1109.08  APPEALS.
   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person, firm, or
corporation, or by any officer, board, or department of the City, deeming
himself or itself to be adversely affected by any decision or action of the
Chief Building and Zoning Inspector or by any administrative officer deciding
matters relating to this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (a)   Initiation of Appeal. Notice of appeal shall be filed with the
secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals within thirty calendar days after the
date of any adverse order, requirement, decision, or determination and shall be
accompanied by payment of the required fee established by Council. Such written
notice of appeal shall specify therein the grounds and reasons for the appeal.
Upon the filing of any such appeal, the secretary shall forthwith notify the
Chief Building and Zoning Inspector of the action so appealed. Within twenty-
four hours, the Chief Building and Zoning Inspector shall transmit to the
secretary all data pertaining to the subject matter upon which the action so
appealed was taken.
      (Ord. 1998-17. Passed 2-3-98.)
   (b)   Public Hearing by the Board. When a notice of appeal has been filed in
proper form with the Board of Zoning Appeals, the Secretary shall immediately
place the request upon the calendar for hearing, and shall cause notices
stating the time, place, and object of the hearing to be served personally, by
mail or by email, addressed to the parties making the request for appeal,
variances, or exception at least ten days prior to the date of the scheduled
hearing. All notices shall be sent to addresses given in the application;
otherwise to the addresses given in the last assessment roll. Not less than ten
days prior to the date set for such hearing or appeal, written notice of such
hearing shall be caused by the Board to be given by first class mail or email
to any person, firm, or corporation owning premises located within 300 feet of
the property line of the property to which such appeal or application relates,
except that in the R-50 District, the distance from the subject property shall
be only 200 feet. Failure of delivery of such notice shall not invalidate
action taken on such application. Further notice shall be given in one or more
newspapers of general circulation in the City at least ten days before the date
of said public hearing. The Board may recess such hearings from time to time,
and., if the time and place of the continued hearing be publicly announced at
the time of adjournment, no further notice shall be required. Any person in
interest may appear at the public hearing in person or by attorney. The
appellant, except the Municipality, shall post security for the cost of all
action required for the hearing of the appeal.
   (c)   Stay of Proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Building and Zoning
Inspector shall certify to the Board of Zoning Appeals after the notice of the
appeal has been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a
stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed by other than a restraining order granted by a court having
lawful jurisdiction.
   (d)   Decision of the Board. Within its powers, the Board of Zoning Appeals
may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify to be done, and to that end
shall have all the powers of the officers from whom the appeal is taken, and it
may direct the issuance of a certificate. The Board shall render a decision on
the appeal without unreasonable delay. If the Board fails to act within forty-
five days from the date the appeal was received by the Board, or an extended
period of time as may be agreed upon, the appellant may assume the appeal has
been denied.
   (e)   Notification of Board's Decision. The secretary of the Board shall
notify the appellant in writing of the decision of the Board, The Board shall
keep minutes of all proceedings upon appeal, showing the vote of each member
thereon, and shall keep records of its official actions.  (Ord. 2020-21. 
Passed 2-18-20.)
   1109.09  VARIANCES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such
variance from the terms of this Code as will not be contrary to the public
interest according to the following procedures:
   (a)   Application Requirements. An application for a variance shall be filed
with the Building and Zoning Inspector for review by the Board of Zoning
Appeals upon the forms provided, and shall be accompanied by the following
requirements necessary to convey the reason(s) for the requested variance:
      (1)   Name, address and phone number of applicant(s);
      (2)   Proof of ownership, legal interest or written authority;
      (3)   Description of property or portion thereof;
      (4)   Description or nature of variance requested;
      (5)   Narrative statements establishing and substantiating the
justification for the variance pursuant to subsection (b) below;
      (6)   Site plans, floor plans, elevations and other drawings at a
reasonable scale to convey the need for the variance;
      (7)   Payment of the application fee as established by Council;
      (8)   Any other documents deemed necessary by the Building and Zoning
Inspector.
      Upon receipt of a written request for variance, the Building and Zoning
Inspector shall within a reasonable amount of time make a preliminary review of
the request to determine whether such application provides the information
necessary for review and evaluation. If it is determined that such application
does not provide the information necessary for such review and evaluation, the
Building and Zoning Inspector shall so advise the applicant of the deficiencies
and shall not further process the application until the deficiency is
corrected.
   (b)   Review by the Board. According to the procedures established for
appeals in Section
1109.08(b) the Board shall hold a public hearing and give notice of the same.
The Board shall review each application for a variance to determine if it
complies with the purpose and intent of this Code and evidence demonstrates
that the literal enforcement of this Code will result in practical difficulty.
The following factors shall be considered and weighed by the Board in
determining practical difficulty:
      (1)   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district; examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are: exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to nonconforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
      (2)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (3)   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary to
make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
      (4)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
      (5)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, trash pickup;
      (6)   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner;
      (7)   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
      (8)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance; and
      (9)   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
   (c)   Requests for Additional Information. The Board of Zoning Appeals may
request that the applicant supply additional information that the Board deems
necessary to adequately review and evaluate the request for a variance.
   (d)   Additional Conditions and Safeguards. The Board may further prescribe
any conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary to ensure that the
objectives of the regulations or provisions to which the variance applies will
be met. 
   (e)   Action by the Board. The Board shall either approve, approve with
supplementary conditions as specified in subsection (c) hereof, or disapprove
the request for variance according to the procedures established for appeals in
Section
1109.08(d). The Board shall further make a finding in writing that the reasons
set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance that will
make possible a reasonable use of the land, building or structure.
      If a variance has been denied by the Board, the-Board need not reconsider
the same request for a variance if resubmitted within six months after date of
decisions, unless the underlying conditions have substantially changed.
   (f)   Term and Extension of Variance. Variances shall be nonassignable and
shall expire one year from the date of their enactment, unless prior thereto,
the applicant commences actual construction in accordance with the granted
variance. There shall be no modification of variances except by further
consideration of the Board of Zoning Appeals. Requests for renewal of expired
variances shall be considered to be the same as an application for a variance
and shall meet all requirements for application and review pursuant to this
section.
   (g)   Appeals to Court. Decisions by the Board of Zoning Appeals granting or
denying variances shall be final within the City, except that an appeal
therefrom may be taken to the Court of Common Pleas of Lake County, Ohio in
accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio by any interested party,
including the City. 
      (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1109.10  DETERMINATION OF SIMILAR USES.
   Where a specific use is proposed that is not listed or provided for in this
code, the Planning Commission may make a determination that the proposed use is
substantially similar to a specific use that is listed or provided for as a
principal or conditional use in the Code, or is determined to be consistent
with the purpose statement for the district in which such use is proposed. If
the Commission finds that a use is substantially similar to a specific use
listed in this Code, the substantially similar use may be permitted in those
districts which have the principal or conditional use most similar. The initial
determination of a similar use shall be approved in accordance with the
conditional use procedures set forth in Section
1109.05. Following such a determination, the similar use shall be considered to
be added to the permitted use list for the district, either as a permitted
principal use or as a conditional use, as determined by the Planning
Commission.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1109.11  ZONING CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE.
   Land shall not be occupied or used and a building which has been erected or
altered shall not be occupied or used until a zoning certificate of compliance
has been applied for and issued as follows:
   (a)   Zoning Certificate of Compliance Required.
      (1)   Occupancy of a Building. A zoning certificate of compliance shall
be required before occupancy of a newly constructed building or an existing
building which has been altered, moved, changed in use or changed as to off-
street parking or loading requirements, for which a zoning permit has been
issued. The zoning certificate of compliance shall only be issued after the
completion of the erection or alteration of the building or buildings, and
found, by inspection, to be in conformity with the provisions of the Planning
and Zoning Code.
      (2)   Occupancy of Land or Building for which a Zoning Permit is not
Required. A zoning certificate of compliance shall be required before occupancy
of land or building whenever the use of land or building has been changed to a
use different than the prior use and a zoning permit was not required. A zoning
certificate of compliance shall be issued when it has been found, by
inspection, that the use is in conformity with the provisions of the Planning
and Zoning Code.  The zoning certificate of compliance shall be obtained prior
to issuance of any required building permit.
      (3)   Change in Nonconforming Use of Building or Land. A zoning
certificate of compliance shall be required whenever a nonconforming use of a
building or land is changed, and shall not be issued until the change in use
has been approved in accordance with the provisions of Section
1167.03.
      (4)   Temporary Certificate. Pending the issuance of a zoning certificate
of compliance, a temporary zoning certificate of compliance allowing for
partial occupancy of a building, or occupancy of an independent component, may
be issued for a period not exceeding six months, during which time alterations
are being made or while a dwelling or other building is completed. Such
temporary certificate shall not be construed as in any way altering the
respective rights, duties or obligations of the owners or of the City relating
to the use or occupancy of the premises or any other regulation of this
Planning and Zoning Code, and such temporary certificate shall not be issued
except under such restrictions and provisions as will adequately unsure the
safety of the occupants.
      (5)   Review and Certification by City Engineer. No zoning certificate of
compliance, including a temporary certificate, shall be issued without review
and certification by the City Engineer indicating that all site work has been
approved, including payment for City review and inspection fees for plans and
specifications for such work.
   (b)   Certificate for Existing Building or Use. Upon application by the
owner, the Building and Zoning Inspector shall inspect a building or tract of
land existing at the effective date of this Planning and Zoning Code and shall
issue a zoning certificate of compliance therefor, certifying:
      (1)   The use of the building, and
      (2)   Whether such use conforms to all the provisions of this Planning

Service Director, Law Department, Community Development, Chiefs of Police and
Fire, City Engineer and Lake County Utilities.
   (f)   Comments and Reports By Officials. After receipt of the EAS from the
Building and Zoning Inspector, each recipient shall review the same and within
seven calendar days shall submit to the Planning Commission and the
Environmental Planning Committee of Council, in writing, through the Building
and Zoning Inspector, comments, reports, recommendations and opinions from the
standpoint of that official's area of responsibility within the City and based
on environmental consideration. The report shall indicate incorrect statements
that the reporting official believes are contained in the applicant's statement
or a statement that the department has no objection.
   (g)   Planning Commission Review. The Planning Commission shall review and
consider the Environmental Assessment Statement during the Commission's review

   (i)   Action By Council. The Council shall, by resolution, within thirty
(30) days from the receipt of the Planning Commission's action on the
preliminary subdivision plat, development plan or zoning map amendment, approve
or reject the Environmental Assessment Statement.
      (1)   If approved, the appropriate permit issuing authority of the City

subject matter proposed in the Environmental Assessment Statement irrespective
of whether such issuance would be allowed by compliance with other ordinances
of the City.
      (3)   In the event such Environmental Assessment Statement is not
approved or rejected within thirty (30) days, the inaction shall, at the option
of the applicant, be deemed to have been disapproved by Council. In the event
any applicant elects to consider such Environmental Assessment Statement
disapproved by Council, such election or option shall not impair the right of
Council to further consider the Environmental Assessment Statement and to enact
the legislation approving such Statement after expiration of the thirty (30)
day period. If rejected, the applicant may refile an amended EAS with the
Building and Zoning Inspector. If timely filed, the Building and Zoning
Inspector shall follow the requirements of subsections (e), (f), and (g).
      (4)   In the event that the applicant shall request the time for approval
or rejection of the Environmental Assessment Statement be extended beyond the
thirty (30) day limit, Council may grant such extension for a time certain.

a zoning map amendment, and in the event the applicant submits all data
required and necessary in order to make a determination with regard to the
construction of any structure proposed on the land after a zoning map amendment
is granted, then, at such time as the structure or development is proposed to
be commenced, no new statement shall be required. In the event any such
structure is proposed to be constructed differently from the data submitted
with the application for zoning map amendment then a new statement, along with
the required fee shall be submitted in accordance with this Section.
   (k)   Schedule of Construction. All Environmental Assessment Statements
shall include a proposed time line of construction for each phase of building
or construction. Wherein the applicant proposes the project to be built in a
single phase or wherein the phases proposed are, in the opinion of Council, of
such duration as to preclude effective planning by the City, after
investigation, Council may establish, for purposes of the Environmental
Assessment Statement, phasing consistent with its investigation and,
thereafter, the project shall be considered phased for purposes of this
Section. Council shall, thereafter, consider each phase of construction and
provide its approval or rejection for each phase in the manner set forth in
Section
1109.12(i). Permits contemplated under Section
1109.12(a) shall, thereafter, be issued for the phase(s) approved by Council.
Upon approving any construction phase contemplated in this section, Council may
include in such approving resolution the additional Environmental Assessment
Statements prepared for any or all subsequent phases of the project.

   1111.01  INTENT.
   It is intended that the developer of a subdivision, a multi-family
development, or a nonresidential development shall dedicate all land required
for rights-of-way, and shall furnish and install all improvements serving the
subdivision or development.  All improvements shall be  extended to the
boundary of the subdivision or development in order to provide a complete and
coordinated system of streets and utilities in accordance with Thoroughfare
Plans or water and sewer plans of the City.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-17-97.)
   1111.02  SCHEDULING OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   The improvements which are required in
Title Five of this Planning and Zoning Code shall be provided and installed by
the developer in accordance with the provisions of these regulations and other
codes and ordinances of the City.  Agreements to install such improvements
shall be approved concurrent with Council’s approval of the final plat or
Planning Commission’s approval of a development plan.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-17-97.)
   1111.03  REVIEW BY ENGINEER.
   The design of the water system, storm and sanitary sewerage systems, and
roadways, and the grading of the subdivision or development and each lot shall
be in accordance with the standards and requirements of
Title Five.  Drawings and specifications for the improvements shall be reviewed
and approved by the City Engineer and the installation shall be subject to the
Engineer’s continuous inspection.
   At the completion of construction, and before acceptance of the public
improvements, the developer shall furnish the City a set of record or “as-
built” reproducible drawings showing the locations, sizes, and elevations of
all underground utilities.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-17-97.)
   1111.04  IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
   The improvements required are determined according to the accessibility of a
sewer system and a public water supply, the relationship to existing or planned
streets, and the type and size of lots required by the Planning and Zoning Code
for the district in which the subdivision or development is located.
(a)   Improvements Within a Subdivision, Multi-Family Development, or
Nonresidential Development.
(1)   Land for rights-of-way for all local streets within the subdivision or
development and for all secondary or major streets within or along the boundary
of the subdivision or development shall be dedicated by the developer and all
easements shall be provided.
(2)   Utilities shall be furnished and installed as hereinafter required and
they shall be of such sizes and capacities as are required for the proposed
development or subdivision and as may be necessary to serve adjacent
undeveloped land that is an integral part of the service area, provided,
however, that the developer may not be required to pay for that part of the
construction of the pavement of major streets, truck line sewers or water mains
which are determined by the Planning Commission to be in excess of the size
required for the development or the subdivision and integral service area.
(3)   The developer shall be required to extend improvements to the boundary of
the proposed development or subdivision to serve adjoining unsubdivided land. 
However, where the Planning Commission determines that a connecting street is
necessary for the future subdividing of adjoining land, but the present
construction of the pavement and/or utilities therein is not warranted, the
Commission may require the dedication of land for such connecting street, the
construction of the pavement intersections, and the extension of utilities five
feet beyond the pavement and that connections be made available for future
extension by other developers.
(b)   Off-Site Extensions.  The construction of off-site improvements to serve
a proposed subdivision or development may be required of the developer as a
precedence to approval if adequate utilities are not available at the boundary
of the proposed subdivision, or development, provided the Commission finds that
the extension of the improvements across undeveloped or unserved areas would
not be warranted as a special assessment to the intervening properties or a
municipal expense until some future date.
(c)   Determination of Scope of Improvements.  In making determinations for the
reasonable participation by the developer for the construction of off-site
extensions, or a major street, trunk line or water main, the Commission shall
consider, in addition to the standards set forth in this chapter and other
regulations of the City, the following conditions:
(1)   The relative location and size of the proposed development or
subdivision;
(2)   The traffic to be generated by the development or subdivision in relation
to present streets.
(3)   The natural drainage area for sewers and the service area for water;
(4)   The development benefits that will accrue to the development or
subdivision;
(5)   The sequence of land and utility developments in the vicinity;
(6)   Any other condition it may find pertinent.
(d)   General Schedule of Improvements.  The developer shall provide at the
developer’s expense, the grading of rights-of-way and lots; and the grading for
and installation of storm sewers, sanitary sewers, public water mains,
pavements, and curbing; and shall properly identify the streets and furnish
traffic control.
(e)   Industrial Subdivisions.  For industrial subdivisions, the Commission may
permit the improvements to be installed and paid for on an assessment basis.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-17-97.)
   1111.05  PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE.
   (a)   Types of Guarantees.  The developer may execute financial guarantees
and shall file such financial guarantees with the City concurrently with the
application for approval of the final plat or development plan.  Such
guarantees may be in the form of a performance or surety bond, a certified
check, or any other type of surety approved by the City.
   (b)   Terms.  The terms of such guarantees shall be determined by the Law
Director with confirmation by Council.  Bonds shall be executed by the
applicant as principal with a surety company authorized in the State.
   (c)   Amount of Guarantee.  The financial guarantees shall be in an amount
equal to the estimated total costs of materials and labor required to install
or construct the improvements.  Such costs shall be determined by the City
Engineer.  When any portion of the improvements has, upon inspection, been
found satisfactorily completed, a reduction in the bonds or partial withdrawal
of funds equal to the estimated costs of such completed improvements may be
authorized.
   (d)   Staged Development.  The developer may apply for final approval and
recording of only a portion of the entire subdivision or development, as
outlined in Section
1109.07(c)(3).  Under such a staged development, the installation of required
improvements and sale or lease of lots may proceed only on that portion of the
subdivision which has been approved and recorded.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-17-97.)
   (e)   Separate Agreements.  The developer and the City may enter into a
separate agreement for construction of sidewalks.  The agreement shall provide
that sidewalks must be installed on the lot containing any structures, prior to
the issuance of an occupancy permit.  When an occupancy permit for seventy-five
percent (75%) of any street in the subdivision has been issued, the developer
will install all sidewalks on the street within sixty (60) days of receipt of a
notification from the City Engineer that the sidewalk installation on a street
must be completed.  To guarantee the installation of the sidewalks, the
developer shall deposit with the City, a financial guarantee acceptable to the
Law Director in the amount of one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the
cost of installation, based on the then current price per foot being paid by
the City for the installation of sidewalks at the time.
(Ord. 2017-117.  Passed 12-5-17.)
   1111.06  STREET AND PUBLIC UTILITY MAINTENANCE.
   The developer and/or contractor shall enter into a contract to construct,
reconstruct, or replace any street or public utility in the City and shall
guarantee the project to be free from defects in materials or workmanship for a
period of two years from the date of acceptance of the project by the City.
   To secure the guarantee, the developer or contractor shall deposit an amount
equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the improvement cost, which amount shall
be determined by the City Engineer.
   The deposit shall be a maintenance bond with the developer or contractor as
principal, and with an insurance company holding a certificate of authority
from the State of Ohio Department of Insurance authorizing the company to
transact business in the State of Ohio as authorized by Section 3929.01(A) of
the Ohio Revised Code; a certified check; bank check; or a letter of credit. 
Any deposit provided in compliance with this section shall be approved by the
Law Director.
(Ord. 2013-32.  Passed 4-2-13.)
   1111.07  INSURANCE.
   The developer shall agree to indemnity and save harmless the City against
and from any and all loss, cost, damage, liability, and expense on account of
damage to property of, or injury to or death of, the parties or a third person
caused by or in any way whatsoever attributable to the construction of the
improvements and the use of streets delineated on a subdivision plat during
construction.  The developer shall further agree, but without limiting its
liability to indemnify the City, to carry liability insurance contracts in an
amount determined by Council for injury to or death of persons, and for damage
to or destruction of property, which insurance contracts shall include the City
as a named insured.  The developer shall further agree to maintain on file with
the City during the period of such construction, certificates or memoranda of
insurance evidencing that such insurance contracts are in force.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-17-97.)
   1111.08  FAILURE TO COMPLETE IMPROVEMENTS.
   In the event the developer fails to diligently pursue the work or complete
the installation of all land improvements according to the terms and conditions
of the agreement, the City, after giving notice which it deems reasonable under
the particular circumstances, may complete the same and appropriate such
portion of money or bonds posted for the faithful performance of such work.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-17-97.)
   1111.09  BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND OCCUPANCY.
   The utilities and other improvements required and deemed necessary in the
public interest to provide essential services and access to a lot shall have
been installed or their installation guaranteed, in conformity with the
provisions of these regulations, before the issuance of a building permit for
construction upon a lot and before the recording, sale or lease of a lot.
   A building permit may be issued and construction started after the
completion of the underground utilities.  If a temporary pavement is
constructed, a temporary certificate of occupancy including a statement that
the City is not liable for maintenance of utilities and other improvements
shall be issued.  The City may require the developer to furnish a cash bond in
an amount required by the City guaranteeing that all streets shall be
maintained in a passable and reasonable condition until such time as the final
pavement is completed and accepted for use and maintenance as set forth in
Section
1109.07(d).
(Ord. 1997-117.  Passed 9-17-97; Ord. 2009-6.  Passed 2-3-09.)
   1111.10  TRANSFER OF LAND BEFORE RECORDING.
   No person, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land located within
the City, shall transfer any lot, parcel or tract of such land or any plat of a
subdivision before such plat has been recorded.
   The description of such lot, parcel or tract by metes and bounds in the deed
of transfer shall not serve to exempt the seller from the penalty provided in
Section
1113.04.  The City may enjoin such sale or agreement by a civil action in any
court of competent jurisdiction. 
   The sale of lots, parcels or tracts from a plat of a subdivision on which
any and all areas indicated as streets or as open ground are expressly
indicated as for the exclusive use of the abutting or other owners in such
subdivision and not as public streets, ways or grounds, shall not serve to
exempt the seller from the requirements of these regulations or from the
penalty provided in Section
1113.04.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-17-97.)

   1115.07  FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN REVIEWING PROPOSED AMENDMENTS.
   (a)   Zoning Text Amendments:  When a proposed amendment would result in a
change in the text of this Planning and Zoning Code but would not result in a
change of zoning classification of any property on the zoning map, the Planning
Commission and City Council shall consider the following items when formulating
its decisions:
      (1)   Whether such change is consistent with the intent and purposes of
this Planning and Zoning Code;
      (2)   Which areas are most likely to be directly affected by such change
and in what way they will be affected; and,
      (3)   Whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of changed
or changing conditions in the areas of zoning districts affected or in the city
generally, and, if so, the nature of such changed or changing conditions.
   (b)   Zoning Map Amendments:  When a proposed amendment would result in a
change of zoning classification of any property, the Planning Commission and
City Council shall consider the following items when formulating its decisions:
      (1)   The change in classification would:
         A.   Be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan of the City or other
adopted plans and policies.
         B.   Be consistent with the intent and purposes of this Planning and
Zoning Code.
         C.   Not single out a small area for different treatment from that
afforded to the surrounding land which is similar in character.
         D.   Correct an error in the application of this Planning and Zoning
Code as applied to the subject property.
      (2)   The proposed amendment is made necessary because of changed or
changing conditions in the area affected.
      (3)   The uses that would be permitted on the property if it were
reclassified would:
         A.   Be compatible with the uses permitted on other property in the
immediate vicinity.
         B.   Not have an adverse environmental or health impact on the
immediate surrounding area in terms of acceptable air, noise, light, or water
quality standards.

   1121.03  ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING MAP.
   The districts established in Section
1121.02 are shown upon the Zoning Map, which, together with all accompanying
notations, references, rules and designations, is hereby adopted and made a
part of this Planning and Zoning Code, thereby having the same force and effect
as if herein fully described in writing.  The map is entitled "Zoning Map of
the City of Willoughby" and, with all its future additions, amendments, changes
and supplements, designates the area assigned to the respective use districts
and their boundaries.  The map shall indicate the approval of the Commission
and adoption by Council.  The map, or print thereof, on file in the office of
the Building and Zoning Inspector shall be the final authority as to the
current Zoning Map districts.  A Zoning Map amendment shall not become
effective until such amendment and entry have been made on such map.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1121.04  DISTRICT  SYMBOLS.
   The several districts may be designated upon the Zoning Map by use of the
respective symbols used in Section
1121.02.  Whenever the abbreviated terms R-100, R-80, R-60, etc., are used in
this Planning and Zoning Code, the abbreviated term shall be construed as
referring to the corresponding district titles as set forth above.   
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1121.05  INTERPRETATION  OF  DISTRICT  BOUNDARIES.
   The following rules shall be used to determine the precise location of any
zoning district boundary when there is a discrepancy or uncertainty as to the
precise location of the boundary:
(a)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow
the lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries;
(b)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately
parallel to the center lines or right-of-way lines of streets, or the center
lines or right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be
construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated
on the Zoning Map.  If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be
determined by the use of the scale shown on the Zoning Map;
(c)   Where a district boundary line is shown by dimensions or relationship as
being located a specific distance from and parallel to a street or property
line, such distance shall control;
(d)   Where a district boundary line is shown as adjoining a railroad, it
shall, unless otherwise fixed, be construed to coincide with the nearest
boundary line of the railroad right-of-way;
(e)   Where a district boundary line divides a parcel of land, the location of
such boundary, unless related to fixed points on the property boundary, shall
be determined by scale, and the parts of the lot shall comply with the
regulations of the district in which each part is located;
(f)   Where a district boundary line does not coincide with any of the
aforesaid lines, and where it is not located by dimensions or fixed points
shown on the map, it shall be determined by the scale appearing thereon;
(g)   Whenever any street, alley, or other public way is vacated by official
Council action, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley,
or public way shall automatically be extended to the center of such vacation,
and all areas within that vacation shall thenceforth be subject to all
regulations appropriate to the respective extended district.
(h)   All questions and disputes concerning the exact location of zoning
district boundaries shall be resolved by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1121.06  ANNEXATION  OF  NEW  TERRITORY.
   Any territory which may hereafter be annexed to the City shall be zoned to
the R-100 District and shall be subject to all the regulations of this Planning
and Zoning Code which relate to such a district until amended in conformance
with the procedures outlined in this Planning and Zoning Code.

   1131.01  PURPOSES.
   One-Family Residential Districts and their regulations are established in
order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
(a)   To regulate the bulk and location of dwellings to obtain proper privacy
and useable open spaces on each lot appropriate for the various districts;
(b)   To regulate the density and distribution of population in accordance with
the Comprehensive Plan to avoid congestion and to provide adequate public
services;
(c)   To provide for proper location of institutions and other community
facilities so as to increase the general convenience, safety and amenities;
(d)   To protect residential neighborhoods from noxious fumes, odors, dust,
excessive noises and abnormal vehicular traffic;
(e)   To protect the desirable characteristics and promote the stability of
existing residential development;
(f)   To establish the R-50 District in recognition of the existing character
of older neighborhoods, particularly in the North End, to ensure that new
construction and additions are compatible with the existing character of the
neighborhood and to ensure that major redevelopment occurs at the same minimum
development standards that have been established elsewhere in the City;
(g)   To promote the most desirable and beneficial use of the land in
conformity with the Comprehensive Plan.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1131.02  USE REGULATIONS.
   Buildings and land shall be used, and buildings shall be designed, erected,
altered, moved, or maintained, in whole or in part, in One-Family Residential
Districts only for the uses permitted herein.
   (a)   Permitted Use Schedule Summary.  Schedule
1131.03 enumerates those uses that may be located in a particular One-Family
Residential District as a matter of right as a principal use, uses that may be
located in a given district upon obtaining review and approval as a conditional
use, and uses that are considered to be accessory to a principal or conditional
use.
      (1)   A use listed in Schedule
1131.03 shall be permitted by right as a principal use in a district when
denoted by the letter "P" provided that all requirements of other City
Ordinances and this Planning and Zoning Code have been met.
      (2)   A use listed in Schedule
1131.03 denoted by the letter "PS", is a use permitted by right as a principal
use, provided that all requirements of other City Ordinances and this Planning

      (3)   A use listed in Schedule
1131.03 shall be permitted as a conditional use in a district when denoted by

that the requirements of Chapter
1155 have been met.  Conditional uses are subject to all other application
regulations in this Code.
      (4)   A use listed in Schedule
1131.03 shall be permitted as an accessory use in a district when denoted by
the letter "A". Such accessory uses are further regulated in subsequent
sections, and shall be permitted as a subordinate building or use if it is
clearly incident to and if located on the same zoning lot as the principal
building or use.
      (5)   Any use not specifically listed as either a permitted principal or
conditional use shall be a prohibited use in these zoning districts and shall
only be permitted upon amendment of this Code and/or the Zoning Map as provided
in Chapter
1115 or upon a finding that a use is substantially similar as provided in
Section
1109.10.
   (b)   Compliance with Standards Required.  Although a use may be indicated
as a permitted principal, conditional or accessory use in a particular
residential district, it shall not be approved on a parcel unless it can be
located thereon in full compliance with all of the standards and other
regulations of this Code applicable to the specific use and parcel in question.
   (c)   Reference to Use-Specific Regulations.  The numbers contained in
Schedule
1131.03 in the "Use-Specific Regulations Reference" column are references to

      (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1131.11  CHILD DAY CARE HOME REGULATIONS.
   This Planning and Zoning Code recognizes that the availability of safe and
affordable, good-quality child day care is important to the well-being of
parents and children.  Furthermore, it is the purpose of this section to
regulate the operation of child day care homes in a manner that preserves the
residential character of neighborhoods.  A day-care home is a permanent
residence of the provider where child care is provided for one to six  children
and where no more than three children are under two years of age.  For the
purposes of this definition, any children under six years of age who are
related to the provider and who are on the premises of the day-care home shall
be counted.  Child day-care homes are a permitted accessory use in residential
districts, and do not require a zoning certificate.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1131.12  HOME OCCUPATION REGULATIONS.
   The purpose of this section is to set forth regulations which control the
establishment and operation of home occupations.  The intent of these
regulations is to control the nonresidential use of a residential dwelling unit
so that the nonresidential use is limited to an accessory use, and does not in
any manner whatsoever disrupt or alter the residential character of the
neighborhood in which it is located.  Compliance with these regulations should
result in all home occupations being located and conducted in such a manner
that their existence is not detectable in any manner from the outside of the
dwelling unit.
(a)   The home occupation shall be clearly incidental and secondary in
importance to the use of the dwelling for dwelling purposes.
(b)   Any on-site business related in any manner to the home occupation shall
be conducted by only occupants of the dwelling unit.
(c)   The business activity, including the storage of equipment, supplies or
any apparatus used in the home occupation shall be conducted entirely within
the dwelling unit and no use of a garage, an accessory building or an outdoor
area shall be permitted.
(d)   There shall not be any change in the outside appearance of the building
or premises, or other visible exterior change related to the home occupation.
(e)   No merchandise shall be sold on the premises.
(f)   A home occupation shall occupy no more than twenty-five percent (25%) of
the floor area of the dwelling, or 250 square feet, whichever is lesser.
(g)   No equipment shall be permitted that creates a nuisance by reason of
generating any noise, odor, dust, vibrations, fumes, smoke, or electromagnetic
interference.
(h)   All vehicles belonging to clients and customers must park in the driveway
of the dwelling.  Client and customer traffic  shall  be limited to the  hours 
between  8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
(i)   The parking of commercial and non-commercial vehicles shall comply with
the regulations for such activities enumerated in Section
1131.10.
      (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1131.13  KEEPING/RAISING SMALL LIVESTOCK AND BEES.
   The regulations of this section are established to permit the keeping and
raising of small livestock and bees in a manner that prevents nuisances to
occupants of nearby properties and prevents conditions that are unsanitary or
unsafe.
   (a)   Small livestock.  The keeping of chickens, ducks, rabbits, and similar
farm animals, and cages, coops and enclosures for the keeping of such animals
shall comply with the following requirements:
      (1)   A maximum of six (6) such animals may be kept on the property.
      (2)   Geese, turkeys and roosters are not permitted. However, if the
gender of a chick cannot be determined at hatching, a chick of either gender
may be kept on the property for no more than six (6) months.
      (3)   Coops and Cages. All such animals shall be provided with a covered,
predator-proof coop or cage or other shelter that is thoroughly ventilated,
designed to be easily accessed and cleaned, and of sufficient size to permit
free movement of the animals, exclusive of areas used for storage of materials
or vehicles.
         A.   The coops and cages housing such animals shall be located in the
rear yard, a minimum of five (5) feet from a side or rear lot line. 
         B.   The total area of all coops or cages on a lot shall not be
greater than thirty-two (32) square feet for up to six (6) animals. Coops and
cages shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet in height.
      (4)   Enclosures and Fences. Such animals shall have access to an outdoor
enclosure adequately fenced or otherwise bounded to contain the animals on the
property and to prevent access by dogs and other predators and providing at
least ten (10) square feet of area for each such animal.
      (5)   Coops, cages and enclosures shall be maintained in a clean and
sanitary condition at all times. Waste materials shall be disposed in a manner
that will not cause odor or attract flies or vermin.
      (6)   Slaughtering of small livestock is prohibited, and no commercial
activity shall be permitted as a result from the keeping of small livestock on
the property.
      (7)   The restrictions of this section do not pertain to household pets
or companion animals.
   (b)   Bees.  The keeping of bees, and associated beehives, shall comply with
the following regulations.
      (1)   No more than one (1) beehive shall be kept for each four thousand
(4,000) square feet of lot area, up to a maximum of eight (8) beehives.
      (2)   Beehive Location and Setbacks.
         A.   Beehives shall be located in the rear yard, a minimum of five (5)
feet from a side or rear lot line.
         B.   No beehive shall be kept closer than ten (10) feet to a dwelling
or the permitted placement of a dwelling on an adjacent parcel.
         C.   The front of any beehive shall face towards the interior of the
lot on which it is located and away from the property line of the residential
property closest to the beehive.
      (3)   A solid fence or dense hedge, known as a "flyway barrier," at least
six (6) feet in height shall be placed along the side of the beehive that
contains the entrance to the hive, and shall be located within five (5) feet of
the hive and shall extend at least two (2) feet on either side of the hive. No
such flyway barrier shall be required if all beehives are located at least
twenty-five (25) feet from all property lines.
      (4)   A supply of fresh water shall be maintained in a location readily
accessible to the beehives on the site throughout the day to prevent bees from
congregating at neighboring swimming pools or other sources of water on nearby
properties.
      (5)   No Africanized bees may be kept on a property under the regulations
of this section.
      (6)   Any person owning or possessing bees shall comply with all state
laws, including the requirements in ORC 909.02 for obtaining a certificate of
registration from the director of agriculture.

   1135.04  DEVELOPMENT AREA AND DENSITY REGULATIONS.
   Land area shall be divided and developed, and dwelling units shall be
erected, altered, moved or maintained in an R-MF District only in compliance
with the following area regulations to ensure that each multi-family
development creates an appropriate residential environment.
   (a)   Minimum Development Area. The gross area of a tract of land proposed
to be developed for multi-family units shall be not less than that set forth in
Schedule
1135.04. The entire tract of land to be developed shall be considered one
zoning lot.
   (b)   One-Family and Two-Family Requirements. In the R-MF-L District, when
one-family and two-family dwellings are located on individually subdivided lots
in a standard subdivision with public streets, such dwelling shall comply with
the R-50 District regulations, set forth in Chapter
1131, for one- and two-family dwellings. One-family and two-family dwellings
included as part of a group development shall comply with the regulations for
multi-family developments set forth in this chapter.
   (c)   Multi-family Buildings on a Lot. More than one multi-family building,
including attached one-family building, may be developed on the same zoning
lot.
      (1)   One multi-family building on a lot shall be termed a single
development.
      (2)   More than one multi-family building on a lot and not developed in
the usual street and lot pattern shall be termed a group development.
   (d)   Minimum Frontage. Each zoning lot shall abut upon a public street for
a distance not less than 100 feet. In a group development, buildings may be
arranged in a group and all buildings need not front on a street.
   (e)   Maximum Dwelling Units. The residential density of a multi-family
development, including a one-family attached/townhouse development, shall not
exceed the number of dwelling units per acre set forth in Schedule
1135.04 for the district in which the development is located.
   (f)   Calculating Units. The total number of dwelling units permitted shall
be calculated by multiplying the total land area, exclusive of public rights-
of-way existing at the time the development plan is submitted, by the number of
dwelling units permitted per acre.
   (g)   Maximum Coverage. The maximum coverage of the lot, including all areas
covered by buildings, vehicular drives, and parking areas shall not exceed the
percentage of the total area of the development project set forth in Schedule
1135.04.

   1135.05  GROUP DEVELOPMENT UTILIZING ENVELOPE LOTS.
   In order to permit the arrangement and establishment of dwellings in group
developments, when located on private roads for efficiency of accessibility,
service, design and arrangement, while preserving commonly owned open spaces
for recreation and privacy, land in an R-MF-L District may be developed as an
Envelope Lot group development in accordance with the following standards and
regulations:
   (a)   The arrangement and spacing of multi-family dwellings or one-family
and two-family dwellings utilizing an Envelope Lot group development shall be
accomplished in accordance with the formulas and regulations set forth in
Chapter
1135, including without limitation the Site Development Regulations set forth
in Section
1135.06, except that such dwellings may be placed on an Envelope Lot along with
   (b)   Envelope Lot group development may be used for detached one-family
dwellings, two-family dwellings and multi-family dwellings and accessory uses
permitted in Chapter
1135, provided, however, that any two-family or multi-family dwellings so
utilized shall in each instance have one Envelope Lot, as defined by Section
1103.03 for each separate dwelling. For clarity, the term "zoning lot" as used
generally in Chapter
1135 shall not be the same as or interpreted to be the same as an Envelope Lot.
   (c)   All dwellings, decks and attachments to the dwelling shall be located
entirely within a recorded tract of land known as an Envelope Lot, and the
Envelope Lot shall be owned in fee simple by the owner of the dwelling, and may
be developed and owned in such a manner that each one-family dwelling and each
dwelling unit of a two-family dwelling and any dwelling unit within a
multifamily building shall be separately located entirely within a recorded
tract of land or combined tract of land and rights above the surface, owned in
fee simple, whose dimensions, locations, size and layout, including its
location above the ground surface shall be subject to Planning Commission
approval through a development plan review as if each Envelope Lot constituted
an individual lot.
   (d)   There shall be no minimum area or minimum frontage requirement for a
particular Envelope Lot. The boundaries of each Envelope Lot shall be clearly
marked at each angle point by the developer with iron pins or other permanent
monuments in accordance with the design standards of the City. Angle points on
the back of an Envelope Lot which abut the common areas shall be marked with
iron pins or other permanent monuments prior to issuance of any building permit
for the construction of dwellings within an Envelope Lot. An Envelope Lot shall
be arranged such that dwellings eventually built thereon will be able to meet
the requirements of Chapter
1135.
   (e)   Driveways serving an Envelope Lot may be wholly or partially located
on an Envelope Lot and wholly or partially located in a common area granting a
right of access across such common area to private roads serving the group
development.
   (f)   All commonly owned spaces for recreation and privacy shall be clearly
shown and described on the Development Plan.
   (g)   The developer shall provide for the formation of a homeowners
association in which each Envelope Lot owner shall be required to be a member
and which shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission at the time
the development plan is approved by the Commission for use of Envelope Lots.
   (h)   The developer of the group development shall provide permanent
easements in favor of each Envelope Lot owner to permit the construction,
maintenance, repair, replacement and use of individual driveways and parking
areas from the road serving the group development across common areas to a
dwelling located on each Envelope Lot. The group development shall further
provide for easements of access for common use to all common land areas within
the group development for the benefit of each Envelope Lot owner. (Ord. 2020-
21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1135.06 SITE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS.
   The following planning criteria are established to regulate the planning and
development of multi-family units.
   (a)   Setback from Project Boundary. The setback of a dwelling from any
project boundary shall be not less than the distance set forth in Schedule
1135.06. The project boundary shall include all lot lines that divide the tract
of land developed for multi-family units from adjacent lots not included in the
development and shall be the boundaries of the minimum area set forth in
Section
1135.04(a).
   (b)   Building Spacing. For group developments, the minimum distance
separating overlapping walls of buildings, or parts thereof, shall be not less
than the distance set forth in Schedule
1135.06.
      (1)   Non-overlapping walls shall have a minimum separation of twenty-
five feet.

   1141.01  PURPOSES.
   Business Districts and their regulations are established in order to
achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)   To provide in appropriate and convenient districts, sufficient areas
for business activities, the exchange of goods and services;
   (b)   To protect residential neighborhoods adjacent to business uses by
restricting the types of business, particularly at the common boundaries, which
would create congestion, noise or other objectionable influences;
   (c)   To protect and stabilize both residential and business developments
from congestion by requiring off-street parking facilities;
   (d)   To provide a Limited Residential Business (L-RB) District for the
residential areas along Euclid Avenue near downtown that are undergoing change,
in order to ensure that future non-residential development is compatible with
the existing character of the area.
   (e)   To provide Office Building Districts (O-B) to promote accessible and
visible office parks where offices are clustered with minimal intrusion from
non-office uses;

existing compact pedestrian orientation of the Downtown by permitting buildings
close to the street and to one another and modifying the parking regulations.

   (h)   To provide General Business Districts (G-B) for commercial services
and activities in locations that are adequately served by major streets and
other facilities and to encourage the grouping of businesses in shopping
centers.
   (i)   To provide the Lakeshore Gateway District (L-G) for allowing and
fostering an appropriate mix of commercial, retail and residential development
and redevelopment opportunities in the north end of Willoughby. 
   (j)   To promote the most desirable and beneficial use of the land in

   1141.02  USE REGULATIONS.
   Buildings and land shall be used, and buildings shall be designed, erected,
altered, moved, or maintained, in whole or in part, in Business Districts only
for the uses permitted herein.
   (a)   Permitted Use Schedule Summary. Schedule
1141.03 enumerates those uses that may be located in a Business District as a
matter of right as a principal use, uses that may be located in a given
district upon obtaining review and approval as a conditional use, and uses that
are considered to be accessory to a principal or conditional use.
      (1)   A use listed in Schedule
1141.03 shall be permitted as a principal use by right in a district when
denoted by the letter "P" provided that all requirements of other City
Ordinances and this Planning and Zoning Code have been met.
      (2)   A use listed in Schedule
1141.03 denoted by the letter "PS", is a use permitted by right as a principal
use, provided that all requirements of other City Ordinances and this Planning
and Zoning Code have been met, including the supplemental use-specific
regulations set forth in Chapter
1155.
      (3)   A use listed in Schedule
1141.03 shall be permitted as a conditional use in a district when denoted by

regulations in this Code.
      (4)   A use listed in Schedule
1141.03 shall be permitted as an accessory use in a district when denoted by
the letter "A". Such accessory uses are further regulated in subsequent
sections, and shall be permitted as a subordinate building or use if it is
clearly incident to and if located on the same zoning lot as the principal
building or use.
      (5)   Any use not specifically listed as either a permitted principal or
conditional use shall be a prohibited use in these zoning districts and shall
only be permitted upon amendment of this Code and/or the Zoning Map as provided
in Chapter
1115 or upon a finding that a use is substantially similar as provided in
Section
1109.10.
   (b)   Compliance with Standards.  Although a use may be indicated as a
permitted principal, permitted conditional or permitted accessory use in a
particular Business District, it shall not be approved on a parcel unless it
can be located thereon in full compliance with all of the standards and other
regulations of this Code applicable to the specific use and parcel in question.
   (c)   Reference to Use-Specific Regulations.  The numbers contained in
Schedule
1141.03 in the "Use-Specific Regulations Reference" column are references to

vacant for more than six [6] months.
      (2)   The applicant has worked cooperatively with the City's Community

   1145.01  PURPOSES.
   The Industrial districts include the Limited Industrial (L-I) District and
the General Industrial (G-I) District. The regulations set forth in this
chapter are established in order to achieve, among others, the following
purposes:
   (a)   To provide, in appropriate and convenient districts, sufficient areas
for services, distribution and production of goods to serve the community,
promote employment and strengthen the economy of the community;
   (b)   To provide L-I Districts for establishments that utilize processes in
which dust, smoke, fumes, glare, odors or other objectionable influences can be
controlled, and which normally generate only limited outdoor activities in
association with a principal activity that is conducted primarily indoors.
   (c)   To provide G-I Districts for establishments that utilize products and
processes which involve some dust, smoke, fumes, glare, odors or other
objectionable influences, but do not create any dangers to the health and
safety of the surrounding neighborhoods, and which involve outdoor storage of
goods and supplies as well as access to rail transportation and major truck
routes.
   (d)   To improve the general environment by prohibiting dwellings,
institutions and public facilities in Industrial Districts, and by the same
act, to make land more readily accessible for industry.
   (e)   To protect adjacent Residential Districts by restricting the types of
manufacturing uses in the surrounding areas to only those not creating
objectionable influences beyond their district boundaries and by separating and
insulating them from the most intense manufacturing activities.
   (f)   To promote the most desirable and beneficial use of the land in
conformity with the Comprehensive Plan.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)

   1151.01  CONSERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   A Conservation Overlay District is established in order to protect
ecologically sensitive areas, floodplains, hillsides, and other natural areas
that, if disturbed or improperly developed, could result in significant
ecological harm to the developed property or neighboring property and to
preserve natural wooded areas that contribute to the image and character of
Willoughby.
   These regulations are designed to achieve, among others, the following
objectives:
(a)    To protect public and private property owners from the potential damage
to human life and safety, and property damage that could potentially be caused
by flooding and increased hillside instability.
(b)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects
and hillside stabilization projects.
(c)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(d)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazards;
(e)   To preserve and protect the unique scenic resources, scenic river
habitats and continuous wildlife corridors.
(f)   To preserve and protect the valuable hydrologic systems, fragile
hillsides and indigenous flora and fauna in these sensitive environments in
Willoughby.
(g)   To ensure that areas of natural wildlife habitats are disturbed as little
as possible.
(h)   To permit development in the Conservation Overlay District that conserves
and promotes the public health, safety and general welfare by minimizing
problems due to water runoff, soil erosion and flooding incurred in adjustment
of the topography, vegetation and tree cover.
(i)   To preserve and enhance the natural beauty of the areas in the
Conservation Overlay District by encouraging the maximum retention of natural
topographical features such as natural drainage swales, streams, slope ridge

yard regulations for the underlying district, all buildings and structures
requiring a permanent foundation, pavement and other structures such as patios
and decks shall maintain a minimum setback of fifty feet from the edge of a
stream bank.  If there is uncertainty as to the exact location of the edge of
the stream bank, the location of the edge of the stream bank shall be
determined by the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Stream Buffer.  The minimum buffer area along a stream bank shall be
thirty-five feet.  The area within this buffer area shall be preserved and
maintained in its natural state unless exempted or approved by the Planning
Commission to be removed and replaces.  Any disturbed area within the buffer
must be replanted using indigenous riparian vegetation.  Trees having a
diameter at breast height (DBH) of eight inches or more that are disturbed,
destroyed or removed from the buffer area shall be replaced by an equal number
of trees within the buffer area, as determined by the Planning Commission.
   (c)   Wetlands Protection.  Identified wetlands that are required by the
Army Corp. of Engineers to be retained shall be protected by a buffer area
having a depth not less than twenty feet, measured from the edge of the
identified wetland.  Within this buffer area, vegetation shall be left
undisturbed in its natural state.
   (d)   Preservation of Trees and Woodlands.  Trees with a DBH of eight inches
or greater and groupings of trees that form a contiguous canopy shall be
preserved to the extent practicable according to the following:
(1)   Preservation of trees.  Trees with a DBH of eight inches or greater shall
be preserved to the extent practicable and removal of such trees shall be
permitted only in the following areas, upon review and approval by the Planning
Commission:

(f)   Residential Subdivision Design.  In order to encourage and accommodate
the goals of the district Planning Commission may approve residential
subdivisions that have less than the required lot width and subdivision
improvement requirements according to the following:
(1)   The lot width and front yard requirements for one-family dwelling may be
reduced by thirty percent (30%) in order to permit more of the development to
be preserved.
(2)   The width of the pavement for proposed local subdivision streets may be
reduced  by up to twenty percent (20%).
(3)   Sidewalks may be constructed on only one side of the street.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1151.07  FLOODWAYS.
   The Flood Insurance Study referenced in Section
1151.03 identifies a segment within areas of special flood hazard known as a
floodway.  Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information.  The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion
potential.  The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway
areas.
(a)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development shall be permitted in a floodway.
(b)   Any obstructions other than a natural obstruction, that is capable of
reducing the flood carrying capacity of a stream or may accumulate debris and
thereby reduce the flood carrying capacity of a stream, shall not be located in
a floodway, except as provided in Section
1151.05.
(c)   No alteration of a watercourse shall be permitted except as approved by
the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1151.08  EXEMPTIONS.
   The following are exempt from the regulations in this chapter.

property or which cannot be revived.
(b)   The removal of trees in time of emergency or which pose potential danger
to life or property.
(c)   On lots of less than two acres, the removal by the property owner of not
more than two trees per year, with a DBH of eight inches or greater.  Any
property owner desiring to remove more than two such trees in a twelve month
period shall submit a tree preservation plan, as required in Section
1151.09.  All cutting of trees shall be in strict accordance with the tree
preservation plan approved by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1151.09  PROCEDURES.
   Every development or subdivision proposed on land in the Conservation
Overlay District shall comply with the following procedures in addition to the
procedures for development plan review or for a conditional use.
(a)   Additional Plans Required. 
(1)   A tree preservation plan, prepared by a professional registered landscape
architect, shall be submitted. Such plan shall clearly indicate the following:
A.   The location, common name and size of all trees with a DBH of eight inches
or greater, and the limits of mature woodlands and young woodlands as defined
in Section
1151.05;
B.   All existing trees with a DBH of eight inches or greater, mature woodlands
and young woodlands which will remain on the site after construction;
C.   All trees with a DBH of eight inches or greater, mature woodlands and
young woodlands which will be removed from the site.
D.   The location, common name and size of all new trees to be planted on the
site.
(2)   A vegetation plan indicating the trees and woodlands to be preserved,
trees to be removed that are required to be replaced and new trees to be
installed.

disturbed during construction and the methods used to protect the remaining
site from disturbance shall be submitted.
(b)   Planning Commission Review.  In its review of development plans, the
Planning Commission may waive, to the minimum extent necessary, either the
environmental requirements set forth in this chapter or the lot regulations of
the underlying district when the Planning Commission determines that such is
necessary to permit the property owner the same number of residential lots as
her/she is entitled to according to the underlying zoning regulations.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)

1153.06   Development standards.
   1153.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Limited Retail and Limited Industrial overlay zoning
districts is to allow the City to establish special land use regulations in
areas with land use, site planning, and/or building design issues. These
overlay zoning districts are also an appropriate mechanism to implement the
City's long-term economic development goals.
   (a)   The Limited Retail Overlay District is intended to be applied to areas
of the City zoned Limited Industrial District (L-I) in order to allow
additional, primarily retail/service uses in locations that are adjacent to
existing G-B districts.
   (b)   The Limited Industrial Overlay District is intended to be applied to
areas of the City zoned General Business District (G-B) in order to allow
additional, primarily storage, distribution and limited industrial uses in
appropriate locations.
      (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1153.02  APPLICATION OF THE DISTRICTS.
   The Limited Retail and Limited Industrial Overlay Districts are overlay
districts that, when applied, are in addition to and shall overlay the existing
base zoning district where the Overlay District is established, so that any
parcel of land lying in a Limited Retail Overlay District (LR-O) or a Limited
Industrial Overlay District (LI-O) shall also lie in one or more of the other
zoning districts provided for in this Code.
   The Planning and Zoning Code provisions of the underlying district(s) shall
apply within the Overlay District for permitted and conditional uses enumerated
in the underlying district, except where specifically modified or supplemented
by provisions of the overlay district.
   Except as modified by the overlay zoning district, the provisions of the
applicable base-zoning district shall apply to all development within the
boundary of the designated area. If regulations conflict, the applicable
overlay zoning district regulations shall prevail.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1153.03  ESTABLISHMENT AND DESIGNATION.
   A Limited Retail Overlay District and a Limited Industrial Overlay District
shall be established in accordance with the required procedures for a Zoning
Map amendment pursuant to Chapter
1121.03 and shall be applied in conjunction with base zoning districts. The
boundaries of all Limited Retail (LR-O) and Limited Industrial (LI-O) Overlay
Districts shall be indicated on the Official Zoning Map and the district
designation of LR-O or LI-O, as appropriate, shall be superimposed over the
existing zoning designations on the Zoning Map.

development standards set forth in the district chapters. Wherever there is a
difference between the provisions of the district regulations and the use-
specific regulations, the provisions of Chapter
1155 shall prevail, unless clearly indicated differently in the regulations. 
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1155.03  COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW.
   Whenever state law requires a use regulated by this Planning and Zoning Code
to be registered, certified or licensed, compliance with such law shall be a
condition precedent to zoning approval of such use. 
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1155.04  USE-SPECIFIC REGULATIONS.
   This section contains additional standards and requirements that apply to

   1161.01  PURPOSE.
   Off-street parking regulations are established to achieve, among others, the
following:
   (a)   To relieve congestion so streets can be utilized more fully for
movement of vehicular traffic;
   (b)   To promote the safety and convenience of pedestrians and shoppers by
separating parking areas and extensive car movements in the vicinity of
pedestrian ways;
   (c)   To protect adjoining residential neighborhoods from on-street parking;
and
   (d)   To promote the general convenience, welfare and prosperity of
residential, business, service and manufacturing developments, which depend on
off-street parking facilities.
   (e)   To provide enough on-site parking to accommodate the majority of
traffic generated by the range of uses which might locate at the site over
time.
   (f)   To prevent the creation of surplus amounts of parking spaces and
reduce unnecessary amounts of impervious surface by allowing for a reduction in
parking requirements where warranted.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1161.02  PARKING FACILITIES REQUIRED.
   Accessory off-street parking spaces shall be provided as a condition
precedent to the occupancy or use of any building, structure or land in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter whenever:
   (a)   A building is constructed or a new use established;
   (b)   An existing building is altered and/or there is an increase in the
number of dwelling units, seating capacity and/or floor area of a building; or
   (c)   The use of an existing building or structure or use of land is changed
to a use requiring more off-street parking facilities.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1161.03  UNITS OF MEASURE.
   In computing the number of parking spaces required by this Code, the
following rules shall apply:
   (a)   Floor Area. Where floor area is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements, gross floor area shall be used for all
land uses.
   (b)   Seating Capacity. Where seating capacity is the standard for
determining parking space requirements, the capacity shall mean the number of
seating units installed or indicated, or one seat for each twenty-four lineal
inches of benches or pews, or when fixed seats are not indicated, the capacity
shall be determined as being one seat for each twenty square feet of floor area
of the assembly room.
   (c)   Employees. Where employees are the standard for determining parking
space requirements, employees shall mean the maximum number of employees on any
two successive shifts.
   (d)   Fractional Numbers. Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next
whole number.
   (e)   Parking for Mixed Uses. A building occupied by two or more uses,
operating normally during the same hours, shall provide spaces for not less
than the sum of the parking spaces required for each use considered separately.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.
   1161.04  REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES.
   The required number of off-street parking spaces for each facility or use
shall be determined by application of the standards noted in Schedule
1161.04. For a use not specified in Schedule
1161.04, the Planning Commission shall apply the standard for a specified use
which the Commission determines to be most similar to the proposed use.

NOTES TO SCHEDULE
1161.04
(a)  A minimum of five spaces is required for each facility other than a single-family
or two-family dwelling.
(b)  For the purpose of this section, a shopping center shall include one or more
multi-tenant building(s) and/or group of buildings where the required parking spaces
are provided in a shared parking lot.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1161.05  MODIFICATION OF STANDARDS.
   (a)   Allowance For Shared Parking. The Planning Commission may approve a
development plan with a reduction in the number of parking spaces required if
it can be shown that the lesser number of spaces is appropriate and consistent
with these regulations under the following provisions:
      (1)   Shared On-Site Parking.  In a mixed use project, when it is
determined that because of varying peak demands, the uses can be adequately
accommodated with a lesser number of parking spaces than what would be required
based on the sum of the various uses computed separately, the Planning
Commission may approve a site plan with a reduction in the required spaces.  Up
to seventy-five percent (75%) of the requirements for the least dominant use
may be waived by the Planning Commission if the applicant can demonstrate that
the peak demands for two (2) or more of the uses do not overlap.
      (2)   Off-Site Parking.  When the required parking spaces for a proposed
use can be accommodated on an adjacent or nearby site, arrangements can be made
between the businesses and other property owners that are not normally open,
used or operated during the same hours to share parking facilities in order to
meet their parking requirements, provided not more than fifty percent (50%) of
the required parking spaces are shared. 
         A.   A shared use agreement is required in accordance with Section
1161.07(c).
         B.   Off-site parking may only be approved if the off-site lot has an
excess number of spaces or if the applicant can demonstrate that the on-site
and off-site uses have non-competing peak demands.
      (3)   An applicant may use the latest peak demand analyses published by
the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) or other source acceptable to the
Planning Commission to demonstrate the ability to share parking spaces due to
varying peak demand periods.
   (b)   Reduced Standards for D-B, Downtown Business District and L-G,
Lakeshore Gateway District. In recognition of the historic, compact character
of buildings in the Downtown Business District and the unique layout and
combination of permitted uses in the Lakeshore Gateway District, as well as the
less efficient use of the floor area of those buildings, the Planning
Commission may approve a development plan with a reduction in the requirements
of Schedule
1161.04, Off Street Parking Spaces Required. In making a determination, the
Planning Commission shall consider the following criteria.
      (1)   D-B, Downtown Business District.
         A.   The character of the proposed use, the design of the building and
the ability of the proposed use to reinforce the downtown environment.
         B.   The availability and accessibility of public parking spaces, both
on-street and within public parking lots.
         C.   The availability of parking areas on adjacent sites, considering
the hours of operation of the proposed use compared to adjacent uses.
         D.   The potential negative impact to the character of the downtown
district if the requisite number of parking spaces are provided.
      (2)   L-G, Lakeshore Gateway District.
         A.   The character of the proposed use, the design of the building and
the ability of the proposed use to improve the area.
         B.   The availability of parking areas on adjacent sites, considering
the hours of operation of the proposed use compared to adjacent uses.
         C.   The overall plan does not interfere with the existing residential
uses in the district.
   (c)   Additional Factors for Reduced Standards Citywide.  Off-street parking
requirements may be reduced based on the provisions of this section.
      (1)   A reduction of up to ten percent (10%) of the number of required
parking spaces may be permitted administratively when the applicant
demonstrates that the reduction in parking will not impact adjacent uses.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may approve a reduction in required parking
spaces by up to forty percent 40%) as a conditional use in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Chapter
1109, when the applicant demonstrates in a parking study prepared by a traffic
consultant or in parking data from comparable sites provided that:
         A.   The use of transit, demand management programs, and/or special
characteristics of the customer, client, employee or resident population will
reduce expected vehicle use and parking space demand for this development, as
compared to the minimum City parking requirements, and
         B.   The reduction in parking will not impact adjacent uses.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1161.06  DEFERRED CONSTRUCTION OF REQUIRED SPACES.
   If the number of parking spaces required in Schedule
1161.04 is substantially larger than the number anticipated by the applicant
and the applicant provides sufficient evidence that supports the reduced
parking needs, a site plan may be approved with a lesser number of parking
spaces provided:
   (a)   That the total number of spaces initially provided shall not be less
than seventy percent (70%) of the spaces required by Schedule
1161.04.
   (b)   That suitable area(s) are reserved for the construction of the balance
of the total number of spaces otherwise required by Schedule
1161.04 and shall be illustrated on the site plan in locations and with
landscaping in full compliance with this Code.
   (c)   That Planning Commission, upon reevaluation of the project's parking
needs, may at any time direct that some or all of the land banked spaces be
constructed.
   (d)   That any additional parking shall be provided according to the
approved site plan and only after approval of the construction plans by the
City engineer.
      (Ord.  2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1161.07  LOCATION OF REQUIRED PARKING SPACES.
   In addition to specific requirements contained in each district regulation,
the location of off-street parking facilities shall further be regulated
according to the following provisions.
   (a)   Residential Districts and Uses. Parking spaces required for dwelling
units shall be located on the same lot as the dwelling unit served except in
multi-family developments where non-enclosed parking spaces are not required to
be on the same lot or Envelope Lot.  (Ord. 2010-149. Passed 12-7-10.)
   (b)   Non-Residential Uses. Parking spaces required for purposes other than
dwelling units shall be located within 400 feet of the use measured along lines
of public access to the property and shall be located on the same lot as the
use served, unless otherwise permitted according to subsection (c) hereof.
   (c)   Ownership of Lots. A lot shall not be used to provide the parking
requirements for an institution, business, commercial or industrial use unless
it is under the same ownership as the use to which it is accessory, or unless
it is approved by the Planning Commission.
      (1)   Parking spaces at an off-site location, regardless of ownership,
may be approved under the following conditions:
         A.   Pedestrian connections shall be provided to ensure safe,
convenient walking between uses and parking, including safe, well-marked
pedestrian crossings, signage, and adequate lighting.
         B.   Pedestrians shall not be required to cross a major street to
access off-site parking facilities except at a signalized intersection along a
clearly delineated pedestrian pathway.
      (2)   The allowance for parking spaces at an off-site location shall be
restricted by an instrument of record describing the premises for which the
parking is provided and assuring the retention of such parking so long as
required by this Planning and Zoning Code.
      (3)   If the conditions for such off-site parking become null and void
and/or the parking arrangement is discontinued, this will constitute a zoning
violation for any use approved expressly with such agreement. The applicant or
property owner must then provide written notification of the change to the
Zoning Enforcement Official and, within 60 days of that notice, provide a
remedy satisfactory to the Commission to provide adequate parking.
   (d)   No parking of a motor vehicle shall be permitted nor shall any person
park a motor vehicle in a landscaped front, side or rear yard area and no motor
vehicle shall be parked within twenty (20) feet of a public right-of-way,
except in the D-B District. (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1161.08  OFF-STREET WAITING SPACES FOR DRIVE-THRU FACILITIES.
   Drive-thru establishments and other establishments which by their nature
create lines of customers waiting to be served within automobiles shall provide
off-street waiting areas, on the same lot as the use, in addition to the
required number of parking spaces specified in Schedule
1161.04, in accordance with the following requirements:
   (a)   Commercial establishments such as banks, drive-thru restaurants and
other similar facilities with service windows or service entrances shall
provide a minimum of ten waiting spaces, but not less than five spaces per
window or stall when there are two or more windows or stalls.
   (b)   Automatic car wash facilities where a chain conveyor or other similar
method is used to move the vehicle through the structure shall provide no fewer
than twenty-five waiting spaces.
   (c)   Self-serve car wash facilities shall provide no fewer than four
waiting spaces per stall.
   (d)   Gasoline stations shall provide no fewer than two waiting spaces per
accessible side of a gasoline pump island.
   (e)   In any case, there shall not be within the public right-of-way
vehicles waiting for service at such drive-in or drive-thru facilities.
   (f)   Off-street waiting spaces, which includes the space for the vehicle
being waited upon at the service window, shall be clearly delineated on the
development plan.
      (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1161.09  REGULATIONS  FOR  ACCESS  DRIVES.
   The location, width and number of entrance and exit access drives to
accessory parking spaces shall be in accordance with the following:
   (a)   Location. Access drives shall be located in such a manner as to
interfere as little as possible with the use of adjacent residential property
and flow of traffic on adjacent streets, and to avoid undue interference with
pedestrian access to street corners. Access drives on corner lots shall be
located as far from the street intersection as practicable. For parking areas
having a capacity of ten or more vehicles, the center line of the driveway
apron shall be located not less than seventy-five feet from the nearest street
intersection right of way line.
   (b)   Number of Drives.
      (1)   Parking areas having a capacity of twenty (20) spaces or less shall
have at least one (1) single-lane driveway.
      (2)   Parking areas having a capacity of more than twenty (20) spaces
shall be permitted one (1) two-way access drive or a pair of one-way drives.
For lots with more than 150 feet of frontage on one street, one (1) additional
two-way drive or pair of one-way drives may be permitted.
      (3)   Driveways shall not exceed three (3) lanes in width.
   (c)   Width. The width of access drives for multi-family dwellings and non-
residential uses shall be not less than ten (10) feet per exit lane and fifteen
(15) feet per entrance lane and shall have a total width of not more than
thirty-six (36) feet, measured at the property line. Single-family and two-
family residential uses shall have an access drive with a minimum width of
eight (8) feet.
   (d)   Radius. The radius of the edge of the driveway apron shall be at least
thirty (30) feet so that a vehicle may enter from or exit onto the curb lane
without obstructing vehicles in other traffic lanes.
   (e)   Board Approval. Access driveway locations shall be approved by the
Ingress- Egress Board after consideration of each of the above factors.
      (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1161.10  OFF-STREET  LOADING  REGULATIONS.
   Off-street loading spaces shall be provided and maintained for all business,
service, commercial and industrial buildings in compliance with the following
regulations:

   1161.12  PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING.
   All development subject to site plan review shall include the following
required landscaping for parking lots.
   (a)   Interior Parking Lot Landscaping: For parking areas in any district
designed to accommodate twenty or more vehicles, a minimum of five percent (5%)
of the parking lot shall be planted as landscaped island areas, developed and
distributed throughout the parking lot so as to provide visual and climatic
relief from broad expanses of pavement. Each landscaped island shall be a
minimum of ten (10) feet in any horizontal dimension and shall provide at least
one major shade tree have a clear trunk height of at least six feet and a
minimum caliper of two inches. Shrub plantings adjacent to a building along the
perimeter of the parking lot, or in any part of a yard, shall not be counted as
interior landscaping. For the purpose of this section the area of a parking lot
shall be the total vehicular surface area including circulation aisles.
   (b)   Additional Plantings along Public Streets: Whenever parking areas
consisting of five (5) spaces or more are located such that the parked cars
will be visible from a public street, landscaping, in addition to the interior
landscaping required in subsection (a) hereof, shall be planted and maintained
between the street and the parking lot. Such landscaping shall be a minimum
height of two and one-half (2 ½) feet, located adjacent to the parking lot and
shall be placed to effectively obscure a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the

         C.   A landscaped mound or berm.
      (2)   The height of screening shall be in accordance with the following:
         A.   Visual screening walls, fences or mounds and fences in
combination shall be a minimum of six (6) feet high in order to accomplish the
desired screening effect.
         B.   Vegetation shall be planted with such minimum height to assure
that the required six (6) feet screening effect shall be achieved not later
than twelve (12) months after the initial installation.
      (3)   All screening shall be free of advertising or other signs, except
for directional signs and other signs for the efficient flow of vehicles.
      (4)   The required landscaping shall be maintained in healthy condition
by the current owner and replaced when necessary. Replacement material shall
conform to the original intent of the landscape plan.

   1163.01  PURPOSES.
   In the interest of promoting the general health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the City, these regulations are herein established to provide for
the location and size, construction, installation, maintenance and operation of
signs in a manner that ensures that signs are in harmony with the character of
the associated use and surrounding area.
   (a)   More specifically, the purpose of these regulations is to:
      (1)   Ensure that signs are consistent with the community's development
objectives, thereby maintaining the community's heritage, aesthetic character
and property values.
      (2)   Promote and maintain attractive, high value residential, business,
and industrial districts.
      (3)   Promote clarity in sign communications while providing reasonable
and appropriate opportunities to identify properties and advertise goods and
services.
      (4)   Ensure that signs are located and designed to minimize sign clutter
and the distractions and confusion that may be contributing factors in traffic
congestion and accidents, and maintain a safe and orderly pedestrian and
vehicular environment.
      (5)   Provide review procedures to ensure that signs are consistent with
the City's objectives.
      (6)   Eliminate any conflict that would be hazardous between signs on
private property and traffic control signs and devices.
      (7)   Provide a mechanism for the eventual removal of signs not complying
with this chapter.
      (8)   Prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this chapter.
      (9)   Ensure that the provisions of this Chapter do not infringe on the
rights of free speech as protected by the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution and Article I, §11 of the Ohio Constitution. All Sections in this
Chapter are to be construed to protect the rights of citizens to speak freely.
All provisions of this Chapter shall be interpreted in a content-neutral manner
excepting those narrow, legally-recognized exceptions explicitly identified in
this Chapter.
   (b)   In establishing these purposes, the City has determined that any sign
that is nonconforming, as described in this chapter, or that is nonconforming
on the effective date of this chapter because it does not conform to the
regulations of this, or any subsequent, amendment is a public nuisance and, as
such, must be abated. Nonconforming signs are unduly distracting to motorists
and pedestrians, and thereby create a traffic hazard and reduce the
effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public. The regulations contained
in this chapter are the minimum regulations necessary to abate the nuisance and
to achieve the stated purpose of this chapter.
(Ord.  2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1163.02  APPLICABILITY AND SEVERABILITY.
   The regulations contained in this Chapter shall apply to all signs, sign
structures, awnings, and other types of sign devices located within the City of
Willoughby, except when specifically stated otherwise.
   (a)   No sign shall be permitted within a public right-of-way unless
specifically stated otherwise.
   (b)   No sign of any type, or any part thereof, shall be erected, painted,
repainted, posted, reposted, placed, replaced, hung, displayed or maintained in
any zoning district except in compliance with these regulations.
   (c)   Architectural features, either as part of the building or
freestanding, are not considered signs and are thus exempt from these
regulations. An architectural feature is any construction attending to, but not

   1163.04  COMPUTATIONS.
   The following principals shall control the computation of sign area and sign
height:
   (a)   Determining Sign Area or Dimension.
      (1)   The sign area shall include the face of all display area(s) of the
sign.  The sign area shall include the frame but shall not include the pole or
other structural support unless such pole or structural support is illuminated
or otherwise so designated to constitute a display device.
      (2)   For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared
and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area or dimensions
shall include the entire portion within such background or frame.
      (3)   For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements on
a wall or similar surface of the building or structure, or an irregular shaped
freestanding sign, the area of the sign shall encompass a regular, or a
combination of regular geometric shapes which form or approximate the perimeter
of all the elements in the display. When separate elements are organized to
form a single sign, but the elements are separated by open space, the area
shall be calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination of forms,
which comprise all the display area, including the space between the elements.
      (4)   When two identical, flat sign faces are placed back-to-back or at
angles of thirty (30) degrees or less, so that both faces cannot be viewed from
any one point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same
sign structure and are not more than twelve (12) inches apart, the sign area
shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. If the two faces are
unequal, the sign area shall be calculated based on the larger of the two
faces.
      (5)   Whenever a freestanding sign is comprised of more than one sign
face and the interior angle is greater than thirty (30) degrees so that more
than one face can be viewed from any point at the same time, the sign area
shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces.
   (b)   Determining Sign Height. The height of a sign shall be measured from
the base of the sign or supportive structure at its point of attachment to the
ground to the top most element. A projecting sign or a freestanding sign on a
man-made base, including a graded earth mound, shall be measured from the grade
of the nearest street, drive or parking area.
   (c)   Determining Building Frontage and Building Unit. The length of the
building which faces the principal street or the length of the wall of the
building which contains the main entrance to the uses therein shall be
considered the building frontage.
      (1)   The building frontage shall be measured along the front wall
between the exterior faces of the exterior side walls.
      (2)   In the case of an irregular wall surface, a straight line extended
along such wall surface shall be used to measure the length.
      (3)   For lots fronting on two or more streets, or where the building has
its main entrance on a wall other than the wall that faces the street, the
building frontage shall be calculated separately for each building wall facing
a street or having a main entrance. The sign area that is located on a
particular building wall shall not exceed the area permitted for such building
wall.
      (4)   For multi-tenant buildings, the portion of a building that is owned
or leased by a single tenant shall be considered a building unit. The building
frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of the party
walls defining the building unit.
   (d)   Determining Window Area.  The window area of a building shall be the
total glass area of windows on the building frontage.  For the purposes of
these regulations, a single glass window shall be the area of all the glass and
mullions that has less than four (4) inches of separation from other glass
areas.  For the purposes of determining window area for ground floor occupants,
the ground floor shall only include the glass area to a height of fifteen (15)
feet above the elevation of the first floor of the building.
   (e)   Determining Sign Setbacks.  The required setbacks for freestanding and
projecting signs shall apply to all elements of the sign, including its frame
and base. The setback for such sign shall be measured horizontally from the
outward edge of the sign frame to the street right-of-way or lot line, as
applicable.
   (f)   Disputes. In the event there is a dispute in determining the sign area
or any sign dimension, the Sign Review Board shall have the final
responsibility for making such determination.  (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)

      (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1163.06  SIGNS IN NONRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   Permanent signs for uses in nonresidential districts shall comply with the
regulations set forth in this Section.
   (a)   Signs for Limited Residential Business Districts are regulated in

or has a customer entrance facing a parking lot and such parking lot does not
face the main street, the maximum allowable area for building signs pursuant to
subsection (a) may be increased for each such additional building frontage. 
The increase for each such building frontage shall be equal to forty percent
(40%) of the allowable sign area if the additional building frontage were
considered the principal building frontage, provided that:
         A.   The allowable increase by virtue of the side street(s) or
entrance(s) is not aggregated with or used with the allowable sign area along
the principal street;
         B.   The sign area permitted on the principal building frontage may,
however, be redistributed along the secondary frontage(s) provided that the

obstruct the view of vehicles entering or exiting the property.
      (7)   Pole Signs at Freeway Interchange Areas. Businesses in the
immediate vicinity of limited access highway interchange entrances and exits,
may be allowed signs constructed to height and area dimensions which are
reasonable and proper taking into consideration the necessity of giving notice
to users of the high-speed highways of the existence of services and facilities
off such highways and taking into further consideration the necessity of having
notice of these services conveyed to users of the limited access highways
without unduly impeding the ordinary flow of traffic thereon. For the purpose
of determining reasonable and proper dimensions, the Sign Review Board may
consider the following:
         A.   A standard and generally accepted sign advertising a service
which is of a standard design and dimension in other areas and sections of the
country;
         B.   The prevailing average height, area and style of signs utilized
in other limited access highway interchange areas outside of the City:
         C.   An opinion, or certification from an engineer licensed by the
State and properly qualified, certifying to the ability of the structure to
withstand the natural or other forces to which such sign or structure may be
expected to be subjected.
      (8)   Multi-tenant facilities. When a freestanding sign is permitted on a
site having more than one tenant, it is the property owner's responsibility to
determine if the sign area shall be devoted to identification of the building
(s), the anchor tenant, all tenants, or some combination thereof.
      (9)   Additional area for corner lots. One additional freestanding sign
may be permitted for a corner lot provided that:
         A.   The total frontage of both sides in not less than 200 feet;
         B.   The area of each freestanding sign complies with Schedule
1163.06(e), and the total area of both freestanding signs shall not exceed 175
percent of the maximum area permitted for a single sign;
         C.   The second freestanding sign is clearly located for visibility
from the secondary street;
         D.   The two signs may be aggregated into a single sign at the corner
provided that the area of any freestanding sign face shall not exceed 150
percent of the maximum area permitted for a single sign as set forth in
Schedule
1163.06(e).
      (10)   Additional area for large lots. The area and number of
freestanding signs on large lots may be increased according to the following:
         A.   In an O-B District, the allowable area of any freestanding sign
may be increased by one square foot of area for every six(6) lineal feet of
building frontage greater than 200 feet.
         B.   In a R-B, G-B, L-G, L-I, G-I and A District, the allowable area
of any freestanding sign face may be increased by one square foot of area for
every four (4) lineal feet of building frontage greater than 200 feet.
         C.   The allowable area pursuant to this section may be distributed to
one freestanding sign for each 250 feet of the lot frontage or fraction
thereof.
         D.   The area of freestanding signs may be increased by one square
foot for each additional foot the sign is set back above the minimum setback
required in Subsection
1163.06(e)(4) hereof.
         E.   Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the maximum area
of a single freestanding sign shall be 200 square feet..
   (f)   Entrance Signs.  Freestanding signs that meet the standards of this
subsection are allowed in all nonresidential districts in addition to the

   1167.01  INTENT.
   In accordance with the General Laws of the State of Ohio, the lawful
establishment of nonconforming uses, buildings, lots, structures, signs, and
other facilities is herein recognized by providing for the continuance of
nonconforming status subject to regulations which limit their completion,
restoration, reconstruction, extension and substitution. While it is the intent
of this Zoning Code to permit such nonconforming status to continue until
abandoned, removed or abated, the continued existence of a nonconforming status
is considered to be generally inconsistent  with the land use plan of the City
and should be discouraged. It is further the intent of these regulations that
any nonconforming use, building, structure, sign or other facility shall not be
reconstructed, enlarged, restored, expanded or extended, except in accordance
with the regulations contained in this chapter. Further, the continuation of a
lawful nonconforming status shall not be construed as a reason to permit
additions to such nonconforming status not specifically permitted by this

   1167.02  NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES.
   A building or other structure existing lawfully at the time this Zoning
Code, or any amendment thereto, became or becomes effective, but which does not
conform to area or width of lot, yard dimensions, lot coverage, height of
building or other regulations of the district in which it is located, is a
lawful, nonconforming building or structure. A nonconforming building or
structure does not include nonconformity with regulations pursuant to a
legally-granted variance from a zoning restriction. A nonconforming building or
structure may continue to be used or occupied by a use permitted in the
district in which it is located so long as it remains otherwise lawful and does
not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Maintenance and Repair. A nonconforming building or structure may
continue to be used, maintained and repaired provided, however, no structural
parts shall be replaced except when required by law to restore such building or
structure to a safe condition or to make the building or structure conform to
the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (b)   Additions. A nonconforming building or structure shall not be altered,
added to or enlarged unless the additions or alterations to the original
building or structure conform to the regulations of the district in which it is
located.
   (c)   Moving. A nonconforming building or structure shall not be moved in
whole or in part to any other location on the lot or to another premises unless
the building or structure is made to conform to all regulations of the district
in which it is to be located.
   (d)   Change in Principal Use of Building. The principal use of a
nonconforming building may be changed to any other use permitted in the
district in which it is located so long as the new use complies with all
regulations of this Zoning Code specified for such use.
   (e)   Restoration of Damaged Building or Structure. If a nonconforming
building or structure is damaged or destroyed by any cause such nonconforming
building or structure may be restored to the original footprint and floor area,
provided such restoration is started within a period of one year from the date
of damage or destruction. Restorations that exceed the original footprint and/
or floor area shall comply with subsection (b) hereof. If such a building is
occupied by a nonconforming use prior to such damage, such use may be
continued.
      (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1167.03  NONCONFORMING USE OF BUILDINGS AND LAND.
   A use of building or land, or building and land in combination, existing
lawfully at the time this Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto, became or
becomes effective but which does not conform to the use regulations of the
district in which it is located is a lawful nonconforming use. A nonconforming
use does not include nonconformity with regulations pursuant to a legally-
granted variance from a zoning restriction. A nonconforming use may continue in
the district in which it is located so long as it remains otherwise lawful and
does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Alteration, Reconstruction or Improvement. No building or structure
containing a nonconforming use shall be altered, improved or reconstructed
except upon prior approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals and then only if the
alteration, reconstruction or improvement does not exceed fifty percent (50%)
of the building or structure's fair market value as determined by an appraiser
appointed by the owner. The appraisal shall be submitted to the City to be
reviewed by an appraiser appointed by the City. The costs of the appraisal and
review of the appraisal shall be borne by the owner.
   (b)   Change in Use.
      (1)   A nonconforming use in a structure designed for a use permitted in
the district in which it is located shall not be changed to any use other than
a use permitted in the zoning district in which the property is located.
      (2)   A nonconforming use in a structure not designed for a use permitted
in the district in which it is located shall not be changed to any use other
than a nonconforming use of the same or a more restricted classification and of
the same or lesser level of intensity and impact, as determined by the Planning
Commission, or to a use permitted in the zoning district in which the structure
is located.
      (3)   Once changed to a permitted use or to a more restrictive and less
intensive use in accordance with subsection (b)(1) and (2) above, the use shall
not be changed back to the prior nonconforming use. The use is deemed changed
when an existing nonconforming use is terminated and a new use commences and
continues for a period of seven (7) consecutive days, including any change of
use in violation of this subsection.
      (4)   Approval of Change in Use.
         A.   The change of a nonconforming use of a building, structure or
land to a conforming use shall be permitted in accordance with the approval
procedures for the conforming use. 
         B.   A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use
only through approval by the Planning Commission according to the conditional
use procedures when the Planning Commission determines that the use proposed is
equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use, and that the use proposed is in less conflict with the
character of uses permitted in the applicable zoning district than the existing
nonconforming use.  In permitting such change, the Planning Commission may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with other
provisions of this Zoning Code and when made a part of the terms under which
the change is granted.
   (c)   Expansion of Nonconforming Use of Building. A nonconforming use of a
building shall only be expanded pursuant to a use variance granted by the Board
of Zoning Appeals in accordance with Section
1167.11.
   (d)   Expansion of Nonconforming Use of Lot. A nonconforming use of a lot or
part thereof, including outdoor storage, shall only be expanded or extended
pursuant to a use variance granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance
with Section
1167.11.
   (e)   Discontinuance of Use. Discontinuance of the nonconforming use of a
building, part of a building or lot or part of a lot for a continuous period of
six (6) months shall constitute voluntary abandonment of such use and
thereafter establishment or reestablishment of a use shall conform to the use
regulations of the district in which the building or lot is located.
   (f)   Damage or Destruction. In the event that any building or structure
occupied by a nonconforming use is destroyed by any means to the extent of more
than fifty percent (50%) of its fair market value, it shall not be rebuilt,
restored or reoccupied for any use unless such use conforms to the use
regulations of the district in which the building or structure is located.
Determination of the fair market value shall be made by an appraiser appointed
by the owner. The appraisal shall be submitted to the City to be reviewed by an
appraiser appointed by the City. The costs of the appraisal and review of the
appraisal shall be borne by the owner.
   (g)   Nonconforming as to Performance Standards. A use existing lawfully at
the time the enactment of this Zoning Code, or an amendment thereto, became or
becomes effective, but which fails to conform to one or more performance
standards, shall not be required to comply therewith except in the event that
the use is substituted or expanded in conformance with these regulations.
      (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1167.04  NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   A sign, lawfully existing at the time this Zoning Code, or any amendment
thereto, became or becomes effective, but which fails to conform to the sign
regulations of the district in which it is located is a nonconforming sign.
Nonconforming signs shall be regulated in accordance with Section
1163.14.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1167.05  NONCONFORMING PARKING FACILITIES.
   A building or use existing lawfully at the time this Zoning Code, or an
amendment thereto, became or becomes effective, but which does not comply with
off-street parking regulations for the district or use in which it is located
may be occupied by the existing building or use without such parking
facilities. In the event, however, that the existing building is altered or the
use is changed or substituted in accordance with these regulations, then off-
street parking shall be provided so as to conform with the parking regulations
for the district or use except as permitted in Section
1167.12.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1167.06  NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   A lot of record which does not comply with the area and/or width of lot
regulations of the district in which the lot is located on the effective date
of this Zoning Code or any amendment thereto, causing the lot to become
nonconforming, may be used as follows:
   (a)   If occupied by a dwelling, such dwelling shall be maintained and may
be repaired, modernized or altered, provided that the building shall not be
enlarged in floor area unless the enlarged sections comply with all regulations
of this Zoning Code, with the exception of the lot area and the lot width
regulations. The number of dwelling units shall not be increased unless all
regulations are complied with.
   (b)   If two or more vacant lots of record or a combination of lots and
portions of lots, with contiguous frontage in single ownership, are
nonconforming as defined in this section, such lots shall be re-subdivided to
conform to the lot area and width regulations of the district in which the lots
are located.
   (c)   In a Residential District, when a lot of insufficient area is in
separate ownership and cannot be enlarged by acquiring adjoining vacant land,
the lot shall be permitted to be used as a site for a one-family dwelling and
accessory building only, provided that all other regulations of this Planning
and Zoning Code, except lot area and lot width regulations, are complied with.
      (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1167.07  NONCONFORMING USE DUE TO RECLASSIFICATION.
   The provisions of this chapter shall also apply to the buildings,
structures, land or other uses hereafter becoming nonconforming as a result of
amendments made to this Zoning Code or Zoning Map.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1167.08  CHANGE FROM NONCONFORMING USE.
   A nonconforming building or use shall cease to be considered as such
whenever it first comes into compliance with the regulations of the district in
which it is located. Upon such compliance, no previous nonconforming use shall
be made or resumed.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1167.09  EXISTING USE DEEMED CONDITIONAL USE; PERMIT REQUIRED FOR CHANGE.
   A lawfully existing use that would be eligible for a conditional use permit
in the district in which it is located shall not be a nonconforming use, but
without further action, shall be deemed to be a conditional use. Any change,
modification, enlargement or alteration of such use, site development
conditions or signs, or change in ownership shall only be permitted upon review
and approval by the Planning Commission according to the procedures for
conditional uses set forth in Section
1109.05.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1167.10  COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION WITH ZONING CERTIFICATE.
   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall prohibit the completion of the
construction and the use of nonconforming buildings and structures for which a
certificate of zoning compliance has been issued prior to the effective date of
this zoning code, or amendments thereto, provided that construction is
commenced within ninety(90) days after such effective date and if completed
within two years after the issuance of the zoning certificate.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1167.11  VARIANCES TO NONCONFORMING USES.
   According to the procedures established for appeals in Section
1109.08, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing and give
notice of the same.
No variance to a nonconforming use shall be granted as authorized by this
chapter unless the Board of Zoning Appeals finds that the applicant for the
variance has demonstrated that the applicant will suffer unnecessary hardship
if strict compliance with the terms of this chapter is required. Such hardship
must be demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence as to all of the
following criteria:
   (a)   The property cannot be put to any economically viable use under any of
the permitted uses in the zoning district;
   (b)   The variance requested stems from a condition which is unique to the
property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district;
   (c)   The hardship condition is not created by actions of the applicant;
   (d)   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights of
adjacent property owners or residents;
   (e)   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public
health, safety or general welfare;
   (f)   The variance will be consistent with the general spirit and intent of
the Zoning Code; and
   (g)   The variance sought is the minimum which will afford relief to the
applicant.
In addition, all other procedures, limitations, and provisions of Sections
1109.09(a), (c), (d), (e) and (f) shall be met.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1167.12  NONCONFORMING SITE CONDITIONS EXISTING AT TIME OF DEVELOPMENT PLAN
REVIEW.
   (a)   If a nonconforming site condition(s) exists when a site plan is
required pursuant to Chapter
1109, then such site condition(s) shall be brought into compliance with
district regulations, unless the Planning Commission determines that such
conformance cannot be reasonably achieved because of existing site conditions. 
   (b)   Existing site conditions include, but are not limited to, the existing
lot configuration and patterns of surrounding development; inability of the
applicant to acquire additional property; location of the existing structures
on the site in question; the amount or location of parking and access on the
site in question, and the location of utilities both on and off-site.  In such
case, the Planning Commission shall approve a site plan that reduces the
existing nonconforming site condition(s) to the maximum extent practicable.

   Developments and subdivisions shall be planned, designed and constructed to
take advantage of the natural features of the site in order to utilize the
natural surface drainage, to economize in the construction of sewers, to reduce
the amount of grading and to minimize destruction of trees and topsoil. The
natural features and other distinctive characteristics of the site shall be
integrated into the plan or plat, as required by this section and to the extent
practicable, to create functional variations in the neighborhood and more
attractive building sites. 
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1171.02  LAND DISTURBANCE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section
1171.02 was repealed by Ordinance 2001-184, passed November 20, 2001. See
Section
1345.01 of the Building Code.)
   1171.03  GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR GRADING.
   Grading of a site shall be limited to the smallest area possible in order to
minimize disruption of the natural contours.
(a)    Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the original
topography.
(b)    Lots shall be designed so that there is adequate buildable area on each
lot.
(c)    Disturbance on individual lots should be limited to the smallest area
necessary.
(d)    Building envelopes should be limited to the flatter portion of sites.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1171.04  GRADING PLAN REQUIRED.
   The developer shall prepare a plan and grade each subdivision or development
in order to establish street grades, lot grades and floor elevations of
buildings in proper relation to each other and to existing topography, as
follows:
(a)    Grading Plan.  A grading plan shall be prepared for the street areas
along with the street  improvement details in accordance with standards set
forth in this chapter, and before buildings may be constructed a detailed land
development plan shall be prepared showing the buildings and paved areas on
each lot and the grading of each block and lot. 
(b)    Block Grading.  The grading of blocks and lots shall be in accordance
with the standards established by the Federal Housing Administration, Land
Planning Bulletin No. 3, or standards of the City. The plans may be based on
any of the following grading systems: 
(1)    Where there is a ridge along rear lot lines and the lots drain to a rear
yard drain, swale or ditch;
(2)    Where parts of all lots drain to a swale or ditch along rear lot lines;
(3)    Where there is a cross slope the drainage onto adjoining properties
shall be skillfully controlled;
(4)    Where the land is relatively flat and adequate drainage must be formed;
or
(5)    A variation of the above conditions.
(c)    Lot Grading.  The floor elevation of each building shall be established
in proper relation to the surrounding grade, the driveway and the street.
(1)    The lot shall be graded so that water drains away from each building at
a minimum grade of two percent (2%).
(2)    Surface drainage swales shall have a minimum grade of five-tenths
percent (0.5%) and be designed so that surface water will drain into a storm
sewer, drain inlet or natural drainage way.
(3)    The minimum grades of driveways shall be four-tenths percent (0.4%) and
a maximum of fifteen percent (15%). Grading shall be adjusted so there will be
no abrupt grades in the front yards and along side lot lines.
(4)    The grades of earth terraces shall not exceed two and one-half to one.
(5)    If a masonry retaining wall exceeds three feet in height, a hedge, fence
or railing shall be provided.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1171.05  DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   A drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the developer as
required for the district in which the proposed subdivision or development is
located for the proper drainage of the surface water of the subdivision or
development and each lot as follows:
(a)    Design.  A subdivision shall be designed, particularly on land of very
gentle slopes, to take every advantage of natural grades so that all the land
can be satisfactorily drained without excessive grading. Unless watercourses or
drainage ways are enclosed, the design shall be adjusted so that rear lot lines
are approximately parallel to the natural or straightened course, and only
where such a design is not possible may side lot lines be arranged parallel to
an open drainage course. Easements for drainage ways and low-lying areas which
are subject to flooding may be included as part of a lot but shall not be used
as a building site or included in calculating the required lot area or width.
(b)    An enclosed storm sewer system shall be provided where a tile inlet or
an outlet with a capacity to receive the discharge is available within 1,000
feet of the subdivision or development and a connection made thereto, or where
it is determined by the Commission that storm sewers or retention basins shall
be provided and connected to a drainage ditch or other waterway without causing
degradation of any sort to the receiving waterbody. The system shall have a
capacity to serve the subdivision and drainage area of which it is a part. The
system shall include pipes, culverts, manholes, catch basins, and drain inlets,
if required, and a connection for each lot.
(c)    An open drainage system shall only be permitted in a development or
subdivision upon approval of the Planning Commission. In making a determination
to permit an open drainage system, the Planning Commission shall evaluate the
value of the open space with respect to the existing natural features, the
level of maintenance required, and the entity to be responsible for
maintenance. An enclosed storm sewer system within the subject development may
be connected to an adjacent natural open waterways or adjacent and connecting
drainage ditches provided that such drainage ditches are within a public right-
of-way or within easements granted for such purpose.
Natural watercourses such as streams or brooks in their natural state, or the
Chagrin River, may serve as a storm water outlet within a subdivision or
development, if, in the opinion of the City Engineer, such natural watercourse
is of sufficient size to accept such storm water outlet without creating
detrimental suspended sediment loads, stream bank erosion or additional runoff
pollution or downstream flooding.  Any existing ditch or watercourse which has
been created by artificial means or is otherwise man-made shall not be used as
such an outlet within the subdivision or development.  If, at any time, a
natural watercourse within a subdivision or development is used as an outlet
the developer shall be required to grant proper easements to the City to the
satisfaction of the Law Director, permitting the City access to such
watercourse.  Any such watercourse shall be cleaned of all debris prior to
acceptance by the City.
(d)   The drainage system shall be designed in accordance with the standards
set forth in the Construction Specifications adopted by Council.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1171.06  SANITARY FACILITIES.
   Sanitary facilities shall be designed and constructed by the developer as
required for the district in which the proposed development or subdivision is
located for the proper disposal of wastes for each lot, as follows:
(a)   Public System.  Where the proposed subdivision or development is located
in a district requiring sanitary sewers and such a sewer outlet is accessible
within 1,000 feet, a public sanitary sewer system shall be provided and
connected thereto and a building connection shall be provided for each lot in a
subdivision.
(b)   Independent System.  Where a subdivision or development of fifty or more
units is not within 1,000 feet of a sanitary sewer outlet, the Planning
Commission may permit an independent system.
(1)   An independent system shall include a primary and secondary treatment
plant and a building connection for each lot.  Such system shall be designed
and the plant located so that it can be integrated into the sewer plans of the
City and the temporary treatment plant abandoned when public trunk sewers are
installed.
(2)   Where a number of small subdivisions or developments are proposed for
adjacent tracts or in close proximity, and where the combined developments will
aggregate at least fifty units or at least fifty acres, the City may construct
an independent sanitary system and assess the costs to the benefitting owners.
(3)   An independent treatment plant shall be located on a site of sufficient
area to serve the entire tributary area and be located at least 300 feet, or as
may be further required, from any dwelling.
(c)   Design Standards.  The sanitary system shall be designed and constructed
in accordance with the Construction Specifications adopted by Council.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1171.07  WATER SUPPLY.
   A water system shall be designed and constructed by the developer as
required for the district in which the development or subdivision is located
and a supply provided for each lot, as follows:
(a)   Public Supply.  Where a development or subdivision is located in a
district requiring a public water supply and a public main is accessible within
1,000 feet of the development or subdivision, a public water system shall be
provided for fire protection and domestic use to serve each lot.
(b)   Private Supply.  Where a development or subdivision is located in a
district requiring a public water supply and a public main is not available
within 1,000 feet, the Commission may permit the installation of a community
water supply for fire protection and domestic or business use to serve each
lot.
(c)   Private Well.  Where a development or subdivision is located in a
district permitting private wells, and a public main is not available within
1,000 feet, a well shall be provided for each lot.
(d)   Design Standards.  A water system shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with the Construction Specifications adopted by Council.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1171.08  OTHER UTILITIES.
   The developer shall submit plans of electric and telephone service lines and
gas mains for approval by the Commission and arrange to have the underground
utilities installed before any public or private roadway is constructed.  The
gas meters and manifolds shall be located in the front yard but not more than
five feet in front of the setback line.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1171.09  OWNERSHIP AND EASEMENT RIGHTS.
   In any case in which a developer installs or causes the installation of
water, sewer, electrical power, telephone, or cable television facilities and
intends that such facilities shall be owned, operated, or maintained by a
public utility or any entity other than the developer, the developer shall
transfer to such utility or entity the necessary ownership or easement rights
to enable the utility or entity to operate and maintain such facilities.
(a)   Utility Easements.  Where utilities are not located in the street,
easements of at least sixteen feet total width shall be located on the center
of rear lot lines and on side lot lines where necessary.
(b)   Drainage Easements.  Where a subdivision or development is traversed by a
drainage way, channel or stream, a storm water easement or drainage right-of-
way conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse shall be
provided.  The easement shall be twenty feet wide (exclusive of required lot
area) or of such further width as is adequate for the purpose.  Parallel rear
lot lines may be required along such way.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1171.10  STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.
   To the maximum degree possible, the following objectives shall be met for
new construction, building expansion or site modification:
(a)   Storm water draining from the site shall not exceed that occurring under
natural land cover conditions unless the system is designed to accommodate the
flow.
(b)   Existing natural drainage courses, wetlands, and water bodies should be
preserved whenever feasible.
(c)   Storm water detention basins and other open space and natural vegetative
areas may be required as part of the water management system.
(d)   Water absorptive paving and water detention design may be required in
areas where practical.   
(e)   The overall storm water management system should be designed to
accommodate the "100 year frequency storm".
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1171.11  EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
   Effective erosion and sediment controls shall be planned and applied
according to all applicable State and Federal regulations and according to the
following principles for new construction, building expansion or site
modification:
(a)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one time
during development.
(b)   When land is exposed during development, the exposure should be kept to
the shortest practical period of time.
(c)   Temporary vegetation, such as rye grass seeding, and/or mulching shall be
used to protect high erosion potential or other critical areas exposed during
development.
(d)   Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins, or silt traps) shall be
installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters from land
undergoing development.
(e)   Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased run-off
caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.
(f)   The permanent final vegetation cover and storm water management
structures shall be installed as soon as practical in the development.
(g)   The subdivision or development plan shall be fitted to the topography and
soils so as to create the least erosion potential.
(h)   Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and protected.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1171.12  TOPSOIL.
   The Planning Commission may require that topsoil shall be stripped from the
roadway and construction areas, piled separately but not removed from the site
or used as spoil.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1171.13  PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES, TREES.
   Natural features, brooks, lakes, hilltops and other focal points within a
subdivision or development, and distant views outside the subdivision or
development shall be integrated in the design to obtain natural variations and
interest in each neighborhood,  Trees, topsoil and other natural resources or
existing features that would add value to the development or to the City as a
whole shall be preserved and utilized in the development or subdivision to the
extent practicable.  The Planning Commission may require that as many natural
features as can be reasonably utilized in the final development plan be
retained and that the grading be adjusted to the existing grade at the trees.
(a)   All trees to be retained shall be protected during construction according
to the following:
(1)   Tree Protection Zone.  The development plan or subdivision plat shall
show the number and location of existing trees as required by these regulations
and shall further indicate all those marked for retention.  All trees to be
retained shall be included in the tree protection zone and such zone shall be
designated on the development plan or subdivision plat. 
A.   The trees protection zone shall at a minimum encompass the critical root
zones of all existing trees.
B.   The critical root zone is a circular area surrounding a tree, of which the
center is the center of the tree trunk and the radius is the distance from the
outside of the trunk to a point twelve times the tree’s diameter at breast
height (DBH), which points constitute the circumference of the critical root
zone. 
C.   The critical root zone shall extend to a depth of five feet below surface
ground level.
(2)   Placement of Tree Protective Barriers.  On the site, trees within the
tree protection zone shall be protected according to the following:
A.   Prior to construction, tree protective barriers shall be placed around all
trees to be preserved and any other vegetation that is located near
construction activity and which is to be saved.  These barriers shall be
located so as to totally encompass the perimeter of the tree protection zone. 
B.   Protective barriers shall remain in place until construction is complete,
landscaping is installed, and an occupancy permit has been issued. 
C.   No land disturbance, including grading or filling, shall occur within the
tree protection zone except as may be approved by the Building and Zoning
Inspector and the Engineer when an aeration system is installed.  Commercially
available aeration systems are subject to approval by the Building and Zoning
Inspector.
D.   Areas within the tree protection zone shall be free of all building
materials, dirt, chemicals (including gas, oil, and contaminated water),
construction debris, vehicles, and development activities.
(b)   Land that the Planning Commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision
or development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock
formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other
features that will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general
welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision or development
and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or developed unless
adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the Planning
Commission, upon recommendation of the Engineer, to solve the problems created
by the unsuitable land conditions.  Such land shall be set aside for uses as
shall not involve any danger to public health, safety and welfare.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1171.14  REMOVAL OF DEBRIS AND WASTE.
   No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish,
excess excavated material or other waste materials of any kind shall be buried
in any land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of the
issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy, and removal of those items
and materials shall be required prior to issuance of any temporary certificate
of occupancy on a subdivision or development.  No items and materials as
described in the preceding sentence shall be left or deposited in any area of
the subdivision or development at the time of expiration of any development
agreement or dedication of public improvements, whichever is sooner.
(Ord. 1997-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1171.15  RECREATION, OPEN SPACE AND PUBLIC SITES.
   (a)   Public Park, Playground, School Or Other Public Use.  Sites for a
public park, playground, school or other public use, if shown on the
Comprehensive Plan or on an adopted Park and Recreation Plan, and located in
whole or in part in a proposed development or subdivision, shall be required to
be incorporated in the development or subdivision plan and reserved for such
purposes.  Drainage courses, ponds lakes or isolated parcels shall not be
accepted unless they become a component and conform with a plan for public
lands.
   (b)   Large Scale Multi-family Development.  Large scale multi-family
developments and other unusual large scale developments may require the
reservation or dedication of additional areas or sites of a character, extent
and location suitable for any needs for extra community facilities created by

   1175.01  INTENT.
   The planning principles and construction standards for subdivisions set
forth in this chapter are fundamental principles and standards to be applied
with professional skill in the planning for the division of land as to produce
functional, attractive, distinctive, convenient and economical subdivisions.
(Ord. 1197-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1175.02  STREET CLASSIFICATION.
   In order to promote public safety and convenience, streets shall be planned
to serve particular functions as follows:
(a)   Major Streets.  Major streets shall be primarily for the efficient
circulation of traffic into, out or around the City and to carry high volumes
of traffic between centers of traffic generation;   
(b)   Secondary Streets.  Secondary streets shall be for collecting traffic
from or distributing it to local streets, connecting with major streets and
providing access to abutting properties;
(c)   Local Streets.  Local streets shall be for providing access to abutting
properties and circulation of slowly moving traffic and pedestrians within a
neighborhood.
(d)   Cul-de-Sacs.  A street that terminates in a vehicular turnaround.
(Ord. 1197-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1175.03  COORDINATION WITH SURROUNDING STREETS.
   The street system of a subdivision shall be coordinated with existing,
proposed and anticipated streets outside the subdivision or outside the portion
of a single tract that is being divided into lots (hereinafter, “surrounding
streets”) as provided in this section.
(a)   Major Streets.  Unless shown otherwise on the Thoroughfare Plan, major
streets shall be planned for continuation of existing streets in the system at
the same width or greater width in accordance with the standards set forth in
Section
1175.09.
(b)   Secondary Streets.  Secondary streets shall intersect with surrounding
secondary or major streets at safe and convenient locations.
(c)   Local Streets.  Local streets shall provide access to each lot and shall
be planned for convenient circulation for the principal directions of travel,
to bus routes, to schools and playgrounds and between adjoining neighborhoods. 
Connections shall not be permitted where the effect would be to encourage the
use of such streets by substantial through traffic.
(Ord. 1197-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1175.04  RELATIONSHIP OF STREETS TO TOPOGRAPHY.
   Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography:
(a)   A subdivision shall be planned so that as many lots as possible will be
above the street grade.  On irregular topography, streets shall be designed to
avoid extensive cuts and fills and to comply with grading standards hereinafter
established for private driveways and yards as well as for the streets. 
Streets approximately parallel to contour lines shall be adjusted so that the
lots on one side of the street will not be excessively below the street grade.
(b)   Grades of streets shall not exceed ten percent (10%) for local streets,
seven percent (7%) for secondary streets and six percent (6%)  for major
streets.  However, in no case may streets be constructed with grades that, in
the professional opinion of the City Engineer, create a substantial danger to
the public safety.  Street grades shall be not less than four-tenths percent
(0.4%) in order to provide adequate surface drainage, provided, however, that
the Planning Commission may permit a minimum of twenty-five hundredths percent
(0.25%) where necessary because of topographic or other conditions.
(c)   Street grades shall conform as closely as practicable to the original
topography.  All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of
sufficient length to provide a smooth transition and clear visibility for
vehicular operations.  A rate of change of grade of three or four percent (3%
or 4%) per 100 feet is the maximum recommended to give at least 100 feet of
sight distance.  Streets shall level off to a grade not exceeding three percent
(3%) for a distance of not less than 100 feet from each side of an
intersection.
(Ord. 1197-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1175.05  GENERAL LAYOUT OF STREETS.
   (a)   Major Streets. Where a subdivision of one-family dwellings abuts a
major street, the Planning Commission may require the developer to prepare
sketches and estimates of a plan based on marginal access streets of such other
treatment as the fronting of lots on perpendicular local streets in order to
protect the residential property form the movement of heavy traffic and to
eliminate driveways cutting into a major street.
   (b)   Secondary Streets.  The layout shall be related to the topography and
natural features.  Driveway access shall be minimized to facilitate the free
flow of traffic and avoid traffic hazards.
   (c)   Local Streets.  The layout shall be related to the topography and
natural features.  The street pattern shall be indirect to prevent through
traffic and yet continuous; it shall be formed of straight, moderately winding,
curved, loop, angular or ell streets.  Tee-intersections shall predominate ;
cross-intersection, gridiron and other rigid geometrical patterns shall be
avoided.
   (d)   Cul-de-sac Streets.  Cul-de-sac streets shall be permitted only where
parcels are isolated by surrounding allotments, where continuous streets would
require excessive grading because of very irregular topography or where other
types of streets would not provide sufficient discouragement of through
traffic.  Where approved, cul-de-sacs shall comply with the following:
(1)   The length of cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 1,200 feet nor serve more than
twenty dwelling units per side of the street dwellings.
(2)   A permanent turnaround shall be provided having an outside roadway
diameter of at least seventy-five feet and a street property line diameter of
at least 100 feet.
(3)   If the cul-de-sac is not open in the direction of schools or playgrounds,
a pedestrian-way shall be provided.
   (e)   Temporary Dead-End Streets.  Where a subdivision adjoins unsubdivided
land, a temporary turn-around shall be provided for each street more than 200
feet in length if lots front thereon, and provisions shall be made for future
extension of the street and utilities and reversion of the excess right-of-way
to the abutting properties and the same shall be so noted on the final plat.
   (f)   Streets of Nonconforming Width.  Dedicated streets of less than the
required width shall not be permitted except in a Conservation Overlay District
where the Commission finds that such a street will be adequate to serve a small
development, or finds it reasonable not to require the dedication of the full
width until all abutting property is subdivided.
   (g)   Reserve Strips Adjoining Streets.  Reserve strips adjoining street or
other provisions to control access or extensions to pavement and/or utilities
to another property shall not be permitted except where the control and
disposal of land comprising such strips have been assigned to the City under
conditions approved by the Commission.
   (h)   Streets for Multi-Family Developments.  Dedicated streets for multi-
family developments shall be planned to connect with major or secondary streets
so as not to generate large volumes of traffic on local residential streets. 
Vehicular and pedestrian access shall be adequate and convenient to each
dwelling unit, planned so that a street, access drive, parking area or delivery
area will be located no more than 100 feet from every main or service entrance
of a building.
   (i)   Streets for Business and Industrial Developments.  Dedicated streets
for business and industrial developments shall be planned to connect with major
streets so as not to generate traffic on local residential streets.  The
Planning Commission may require the dedication and improvement of service roads
along major streets.
   (j)   Curvature of Streets.  Angles in the alignment of street lines shall
be connected by a curve with a radius on the center line of not less than 200
feet for local streets, 300 feet for secondary streets and 500 feet for major
streets.  Between reverse curves there shall be a tangent at least 100 feet
long on major and secondary streets and fifty feet long on local streets.
(Ord. 1197-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1175.06  STREET INTERSECTIONS.
   (a)   Streets shall be designed to intersect as nearly as possible at 90
degrees and no two streets shall intersect at less than 60 degrees.  Not more
than two streets shall intersect at any one point, unless the City Engineer
certifies to the Planning Commission that such an intersection can be
constructed with no extraordinary danger to public safety.
   (b)   Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a street
shall coincide with existing or proposed intersections on the opposite side of
such street.  In any event, where a centerline offset (jog) occurs at an
intersection, the distance between centerlines of the intersecting streets
shall be not less than 125 feet.
   (c)   Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius
of not less than thirty feet for major streets, twenty feet for secondary
streets, ten feet for local streets.
(Ord. 1197-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1175.07  BLOCK DESIGN.
   Streets shall be laid out so that blocks are created in compliance with the
following:
(a)   General Layout  Blocks shall be designed to accommodate lots of the size
required for the zoning district as set forth in this Planning and Zoning Code
and to provide for convenient access, circulation and safety of traffic on the
bounding streets.  The lines and boundaries of blocks shall be adjusted to
conform to the topography and natural features, such as streams and lakes, and
so that rear or side lot lines will coincide with corporation lines. 
   When a parcel is too small to be laid out economically for the use intended
and would result in fractional or odd shaped lots or otherwise not conform to
the planning principles, the Commission may request the developer to include
adjoining unsubdivided land so a complete block may be planned and developed as
a unit. 
(b)   Blocks for One-Family Subdivisions.  Block lengths shall be planned to
average 1500 feet and shall not exceed 1800 feet or be less than 800 feet,
unless approved by the Commission.  Block widths, shall be planned to
accommodate two tiers of lots, except that a single tier of lots may be
required by the Commission to separate residential development from major
streets, adjoining nonresidential land uses or unusual topographic or natural
features.  A planting screen at least ten feet in width, with no right of
access, may be required along the length of lots abutting such a major street
or nonresidential land use.
(c)   Blocks for Non-One-Family Developments  Blocks for multi-family, business
or industrial subdivisions shall be adequate to accommodate the building sites
and provide the yards, service drives, off-street parking and other required
facilities, and shall be designed for unit development and not necessarily
according to the typical lot and street pattern.
(d)   Pedestrian Ways.  Pedestrian ways having a minimum right-of-way of
twenty-five feet and in a straight line may be required across excessively long
blocks or at the end of cul-de-sac streets for access to schools, playgrounds
or bus stops, or to other public facilities where convenient pedestrian
circulation has not been provided by sidewalks and or streets. 
(Ord. 1197-117. Passed 9-16-97.)
   1175.08  LOT DESIGN.
   (a)   Building Sites.  Each lot shall be designed to form a good site for
the type of building to be developed and the lot lines shall not be considered
as merely forming a geometric shape which encloses the minimum area permitted. 
The lots shall be more or less rectangular in form; triangular, elongated or
other shapes that restrict its use as a building site shall be avoided.

afford a reasonable means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles as well
as for all those likely to need or desire access to the property in its
intended use.
   (c)   Area and Width.  The area and width of each lot in a subdivision shall
be not less than required by the Planning and Zoning Code and shall be
appropriate for the neighborhood and type of development proposed.  The width
of a lot shall be not less than that required at the front yard building line. 
On curved streets the arc of the front lot line or a rear lot line shall be not
less than sixty percent (60%) of the required width at the building line. 
   (d)   Depth.  No lot shall be created having a depth, measured at right
angle from the street right-of-way, less than required by this Planning and
Zoning Code.

reserve openings at intervals along the motor roads for future local streets to
serve the interior areas. 
   (f)   Corner Lots.  Corner lots in a one-family subdivision shall have extra
width to obtain the required side yards and building setback from, and
appropriate orientation to both streets and as may be required by the Zoning
Code.  Lots abutting a pedestrian way shall have extra width. 
   (g)   Side Lot Lines.  Side lot lines shall be designed to be at right
angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.  Where a
street terminates on another to form a “T” intersection, the side lot lines
shall be planned so that a dwelling site will not be directly on the projected
line of the street which intersects. 
   (h)   Entrances to Streets.  All driveway entrances and other openings onto
streets within the City shall be constructed so that:
(1)   Vehicles can exit from the lot in question without having to back up on
to a major thoroughfare.  For the purposes of this section, the following
streets are considered major thoroughfares: Euclid Ave., Lake Shore Blvd., S.R.
84, Lost Nation Rd., and S.R. 91.
(2)   Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or
surrounding streets is minimized.

fence or wall may be approved administratively by the Building and Zoning
Inspector when the Building and Zoning Inspector determines that the proposal:
         A.   Complies with the requirements of this section;
         B.   Is consistent with any previously approved plan;
         C.   Is compatible with the current site development if there is no
approved plan; and
         D.   Will have a minimum adverse impact to the surrounding areas.
      (3)   If, because of the nature and location of the proposed fence or
wall, the Building and Zoning Inspector does not make such a determination, the
request shall be referred to the Planning Commission and considered by the
Commission according to the development plan procedures in Section
1109.04.

at the time of development according to the construction specifications adopted
by Council and shall not be less than the construction specifications required
in residential development.
   (e)   Whenever the Planning Commission finds that a means of pedestrian
access is necessary from an unsubdivided development to schools, parks,
playgrounds, or other roads or facilities and that such access is not
conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the roads, the developer may be
required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least twenty-five (25) feet
to provide such access.
   (f)   The sidewalks required by this section shall be at least five (5) feet
wide and constructed according to the construction specifications adopted by

not feasible because of the nature of the use of the building.
            3.   All sides of buildings and accessory buildings shall include
design characteristics that are consistent with those used on the facade.
         B.   Facade Base Treatment. The façade must have a recognizable base
using design patterns similar, but not limited to:
            1.   Thicker walls, ledges or sills.
            2.   Integrally textured elements such as stone, stucco or other
masonry feature.
            3.   Integrally colored and patterned elements such as smooth
finished stone.
            4.   Lighter or darker colored elements, mullions or panels.
      (4)   Side and Rear Walls. In addition to the other requirements,
building design shall incorporate four-sided wall architecture with the intent
of providing a continuous building pattern on all sides of the development
regardless of orientation or development. As such, the side and rear building
walls shall incorporate the same building materials, proportionality and
texture as the front façade.
      (5)   Long Walls. Walls exceeding 100 feet in length as measured and
visible from a road right-of-way should include at least one change in wall
plane, such as projections or recesses extending at least twenty percent (20%)
of the entire length of the façade, in one design element or a combination of
elements, projections or recessions.
      (6)   Building Entrance. Primary building entrances shall be clearly
defined and recessed or framed by a sheltering element such as an awning,
arcade or portico to provide shelter from weather elements. Entrances shall
combine different colors, textures and architectural elements to emphasize
entrance points and break the monotony of large vertical surfaces.
      (7)   Building Roofs. The continuous plane of a roofline shall be no
greater than 100 feet. Rooflines can be varied with cantilevers, gables,
parapets, and/or cornice lines. Building walls, parapets, and/or roof systems
shall be designed to conceal all roof-mounted mechanical equipment from view to
adjacent properties and public rights-of-way. Mechanical equipment screening
techniques shall incorporate the same design standards, proportionality and
texture as the front façade.
      (8)   Colors. Building colors must be low-reflecting, muted and earth-
toned. Roof colors must be muted and compatible with dominant building color.
      (9)   Windows. The use of black or reflective glass on any side of the
building shall be limited and subject to the approval of the Planning
Commission.
   (c)   Additional Design Standards for R-B, D-B and L-G Districts. In
addition to the requirements of subsection (a) hereof, and in order to achieve
a small scale pedestrian environment and the appearance of smaller tenants, all
uses in the R-B Retail, Downtown Business and Lakeshore Gateway District shall
comply with the following building design elements for that portion of a
building facing onto a public street, pedestrian way, plaza, parking lot or
sidewalk:
      (1)   A minimum of sixty percent (60%) of the wall shall have display-
type windows. The bottom edge of such windows shall not be higher than three
feet above grade.
      (2)   There shall be no more than twenty (20) feet of the contiguous wall
length devoid of windows unless the wall includes architectural features such
as piers, columns, bays or undulation of the building so that a pedestrian
scale and rhythm is created.
      (3)   Supplemental architectural features, such as pedestrian colonnades,
columns and varying roof lines and roof heights, shall be included over the
entire length of the building.                               
      (4)   Height. Buildings shall have the appearance of being at least two
(2) stories in height. This can be accomplished through the use of pitched
roofs, dormer windows or other architectural elements.
         (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1181.04  BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS IN INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS.
   In an industrial district, any building on a lot that abuts Euclid Avenue,
Vine Street, Lost Nation, SR 91 or Erie Street shall comply with the design
standards set forth in Section
1181.03.
(Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1181.05  SITE DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The following shall be required of all new development and redevelopment
except for one-family dwellings.
   (a)   Landscaping and Screening Design Standards.
      (1)   The proposed site shall demonstrate consideration toward placing
structures and off-street parking areas to avoid the destruction of heavily
wooded areas, outstanding trees species and riparian areas.
      (2)   Landscape materials shall be arranged to create varied and
attractive views and complement the architectural features of the principal
structure on the site
      (3)   In areas where general planting will not prosper, other materials
such as fences, walls, pavings of wood, brick, stone, gravel and cobbles shall
be used. Carefully selected plants shall be combined with such materials where
possible.
      (4)   Every effort shall be made during construction to preserve existing
healthy trees and shrubs on the site. Preservation of trees and vegetation of
special significance due to size, age, habitat, or historical significance is
highly encouraged. A mature tree, tree mass or woodland should remain on the
site providing it does not pose any undue threat to the health, safety and
welfare by its location with respect to any proposed improvements to the site.
   (b)   Accessory Structures. Vending machines, trash areas, and other site
accessories shall be integrated into the overall design of the plan. Vending
machines shall be prohibited outside of the building.  Trash dumpsters shall be
enclosed, in accordance with Chapter
1179.
   (c)   Lighting.
      (1)   Exterior lighting of buildings and/or parking areas shall be
positioned so as not to emit light onto neighboring properties or road right-
of-ways, but shall shine directly onto buildings, or be directed downward onto
parking areas, access drives and pedestrian walkways.
      (2)   Light pollution control measures shall be taken to avoid negative
impact of misdirected light. Businesses that utilize canopy lighting shall use
recessed ceiling fixtures with the bottom of the lenses flush with the canopy
in addition to meeting other lighting guidelines. Building mounted light
fixtures and free standing light fixtures should be in proportion with the
building and shall not exceed the building height.
      (3)   Light Trespass. Light trespass over a commercial or industrial
property line when adjoining residential properties shall be prohibited. Fully
shielded light sources (full cut off) shall be used. These are shielded so that
light emitted from a fixture, directly or indirectly, is projected below a
horizontal plane through the lowest point of the fixture where light is
emitted.
      (4)   Uplighting is not permitted, except for use on flagpoles.
         (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1181.06  SUSTAINABILITY CONSIDERATIONS.
   To the maximum extent practicable, new development/redevelopment is
encouraged to incorporate one or more of the following features:
   (a)   Low-Impact Development (LID) stormwater management features; designed
for on-site stormwater mitigation through low impact development techniques.
   (b)   Porous paving blocks and pervious paving materials are encouraged as
material for parking lots and/or sidewalks.
   (c)   Energy-efficient materials, including recycled materials that meet the
requirements of this Code.
   (d)   Community amenities such as public art, places to congregate such as
plazas, malls, gardens, outdoor seating, and pedestrian and transit facilities.

   1309.01  TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the Exterior Property Maintenance Code of the
City of Willoughby, Ohio, and may be referred to in this chapter as "the Code".
(Ord. 1982-257. Passed 12-21-82.)
   1309.02  FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   It is hereby found and declared that there exists in the City, structures
used for residential and nonresidential use which are, or may become in the
future, substandard with respect to structure and maintenance, or further; that
such conditions, including but not limited to structural deterioration, lack of
maintenance, the appearance of the exterior of the premises, and the existence
of fire hazards and unsanitary conditions, constitute a menace to the health,
safety, welfare and reasonable comfort of the residents and inhabitants of the
City. It is further found and declared that, by reason of lack of maintenance
and progressive deterioration, certain properties have the further effect of
creating blighting conditions and initiating slums; and, that if the same are
not curtailed and removed, the aforesaid conditions shall grow and spread and
shall necessitate, in time, the expenditure of large amounts of public funds to
correct and eliminate the same; and, that by reason of timely regulations and
restrictions, as herein contained, the growth of slums and blight may be
prevented and the immediate neighborhood and property values thereby
maintained, the desirability and amenities of residential and nonresidential
uses and immediate neighborhoods enhanced, and the public health, safety and
welfare protected and fostered.
(Ord. 1982-257. Passed 12-21-82.)
   1309.03  PURPOSES.
   The purpose of this Code is to protect the public health, safety and welfare
of the residents and inhabitants of the City by establishing minimum standards
governing the maintenance, appearance and condition of all residential and
nonresidential premises; to fix certain responsibilities and duties upon owners
and operators; to authorize and establish procedures for the inspection of
residential and nonresidential premises; to fix penalties for the violations of
this Code; and to provide for the right of access across adjoining premises to
permit repairs. This Code is hereby declared to be remedial and essential for
the public interest and it is intended that this Code be liberally construed to
effectuate the purposes as stated herein.

which it is situated in the City, used or intended to be used for dwelling,
retail, commercial, business, light manufacturing or industrial occupancy;
shall comply with the provisions of this Code, whether or not such building has
been constructed, altered or repaired before or after the enactment of this
Code, and irrespective of any permits or licenses which shall have been issued
for the use or occupancy of the building or for the installation or repair of
equipment or facilities prior to the effective date of this Code.
   This Code establishes minimum standards for the initial and continued
occupancy and use of all such buildings and does not replace or modify
standards otherwise established for the construction, repair, alteration or use
of the building; except as provided in subsection (b) hereof. Where there is
mixed occupancy, residential or nonresidential use therein shall be
nevertheless regulated by and subject to the provisions of this Code.
   (b)    In any case, where the provisions of this Code impose a higher
standard than set forth in any other ordinances of the City or under the laws
of the State, then the standards as set forth herein shall prevail; but if the
provisions of this Code impose a lower standard than any other ordinances of
the City or of the laws of the State, then the higher standard contained in any
such other ordinance or law shall prevail.
   (c)    After the date of enactment hereof, all licenses and permits shall be
issued upon compliance with this Code as well as compliance with the ordinances
under which such licenses and permits are granted.
   (d)    No license or permit or other certification of compliance with this
Code shall constitute a defense against any violation or any other ordinance of
the City applicable to any structure or premises; nor shall any provision
herein relieve any owner, operator or occupant from complying with any such
other provision; nor any official of the City from enforcing any such other
provision.
(Ord. 1982-257. Passed 12-21-82.)
   1309.06  OWNER, OPERATOR AND OCCUPANT DUTIES AND  RESPONSIBILITIES.
   Owners and operators shall have all the duties and responsibilities as
prescribed in this Code and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, and
no owner or operator shall be relieved from any such duty and responsibility,
nor be entitled to defend against any charge of violation thereof by reason of
the fact that the occupant is also responsible therefor and in violation
thereof.
   Unless expressly provided to the contrary in this Code, the respective
obligations and responsibilities of the owner and operator, on one hand, and
the occupant, on the other, shall not be altered or affected by an agreement or
contract by and between any of the aforesaid or between them and any other

   (a)    Residential.  The exterior of the premises, the exterior of dwelling
structures and the condition of accessory structures shall be maintained so
that the appearance of the premises and all buildings thereon shall reflect a
level of maintenance in keeping with the residential standards of the immediate
neighborhood so that the appearance of the premises and structures shall not
constitute a blighting factor for adjoining property owners nor an element
leading to the progressive deterioration and downgrading of the immediate
neighborhood with the accompanying diminution of property values, including the
following:
(1)    Storage of commercial and industrial material. There shall not be stored
or used at a location visible from the sidewalk, street or other public area,

covering and original design or replacement thereof. All exterior walls and
surfaces shall be properly protected against the weather where such are
defective or lack weather protection, including lack of paint or surface
covering, or have weathered due to lack of the proper protective covering.
4.    The structure shall be maintained free of broken windows, crumbling stone
or brick, or other conditions reflective of deterioration or inadequate
maintenance to the end that the property itself may be preserved, safety and
fire hazards eliminated, and the adjoining properties and the immediate
neighborhood protected from blighting influences.
C.    Any dwelling structure or secondary or appurtenant structure whose 
exterior surface is deteriorated, decaying, disintegrating or whose exterior
surface has weathered with dirt and grime, or has been impaired through peeling

(Ord. 1982-257.  Passed 12-21-82.)
   (b)    Nonresidential.  The exterior of the premises and the condition of
accessory structures shall be maintained so that the appearance of the premises
and all buildings thereon shall reflect a level of maintenance in keeping with
the standards of the immediate neighborhood so that the appearance of the
premises and structures shall not constitute a blighting factor for the
adjoining property owners nor an element leading to the progressive
deterioration and downgrading of the immediate neighborhood with the
accompanying diminution of property values, including the following:
(1)    Landscaping.  Premises shall be maintained. Lawns, hedges and bushes
shall be kept from becoming overgrown and unsightly where exposed to the public
view and where the same constitute a blighting factor which depreciates any
adjoining property.

public view permitted by reason of other regulations or as a lawful
nonconforming use, shall be maintained in good repair. Any signs which have
weathered or are faded, or those upon which the paint has peeled or cracked

other permanent rendering of the windows to make them opaque to the public
view. All screening of interiors shall be maintained in a clean and an
attractive manner and kept in a good state of repair.
(4)    Store fronts.  All store fronts shall be kept in good repair, painted
where required and shall not constitute a safety hazard or a nuisance. In the
event repairs to a store front become necessary, such repairs shall be made
with the same (or with similar) materials as used in the construction of the
store front in such a manner as to permanently repair the damaged area or
areas. Any cornice visible above a store front shall be kept painted, where
required and in good repair.
(5)    Awnings and marquees.  Any awning or marquee and its accompanying
structural members which extend over any street, sidewalk or other portion of
the premises shall be maintained in good repair, and shall not constitute a
nuisance or a safety hazard. In the event such awnings or marquees are not
properly maintained in accordance with the foregoing, they shall, together with
their supporting members, be removed forthwith. In the event such awnings or
marquees are made of cloth, plastic or similar materials, such cloth or
plastic, where exposed to public view, shall be maintained in good condition
and shall not show evidence of weathering, discoloration, ripping, tearing or
other holes. Nothing herein shall be construed to authorize any encroachment on
streets, sidewalks or other parts of the public domain.
      (6)   Window screening for vacant store fronts.  Whenever a ground floor
storefront in a L-RB, D-B, R-B, G-B or L-G Business District becomes vacant,
the property owner shall install a window screen to obscure the view of the

display public art for the duration of the vacancy and subject to the
availability of public art from an approved public art provider, such as the
Willoughby Fine Arts Association. 
         F.   Application. An application for a Window Screen shall be filed
with the Building Department on forms prescribed by the Building Commissioner,

(Ord. 1982-257. Passed 12-21-82.)
   1309.10  ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.
   (a)    Property Maintenance Officer.  The Chief Building and Zoning
Inspector of the City is hereby designated to serve as the Property Maintenance
Officer hereunder; and all inspections, regulations, enforcement and hearings
on violations of the provisions of this Code, unless expressly stated to the
contrary, shall be under his direction and supervision. He may appoint or
designate, subject to the approval of the Mayor, such other public officials or
employees of the City to perform duties as may be necessary to the enforcement
of this Code, including the making of inspections.
   (b)    When Inspections Are to be Made.
(1)    Residential.  All buildings and premises subject to this Code are
subject to inspection from time to time by the enforcing officer of the City.
At the time of such inspections, all the exterior parts of the premises shall
be available and accessible for such inspection, and the owner, operator and
occupant are required to provide the necessary arrangements to facilitate such
inspection. Such inspection shall be made between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:
00 p.m., unless the premises are not available during the foregoing hours for
inspections, or there is a reason to believe a violation exists of a character
which is an immediate threat to health or safety, thereby requiring inspection
and abatement without delay.
(2)    Nonresidential.  All buildings and premises subject to this Code are
subject to inspection from time to time by the enforcing officer. At the time
of such inspections, all exterior parts of the premises shall be available and
accessible for such inspections, and the owner or operator is required to
provide the necessary arrangements to facilitate such inspections. Such
inspections shall be made during the regular open hours of the business
occupying such premises unless there is a reason to believe a violation exists
of a character which is an immediate threat to health or safety, thereby
requiring inspection and abatement without delay.
(3)    Conduct of Inspectors.  Inspectors shall conduct themselves so as to
avoid intentional embarrassment or inconvenience to occupants.
(Ord. 1982-257. Passed 12-21-82.)
 
   (c)   Issuance of Citations.  The Property Maintenance Officer, or his/her
designee, is granted the authority to issue citations for failure to comply
with any orders issued pursuant to the Exterior Property Maintenance Code
adopted by the City of Willoughby.
(Ord. 2011-17.  Passed 2-15-11.)
   1309.11  WHERE ACCESS BY INSPECTORS IS REFUSED.
   (a)    Where the Property Maintenance Officer or his agent is refused
access, or is otherwise impeded or prevented by the owner, occupant or operator
from conducting an inspection of the premises, such person shall be in
violation of this Code and subject to the penalties contained under Section
1309.99.
   (b)    In addition to the provisions herein, the Property Maintenance
Officer may apply to the Willoughby Municipal Court, upon affidavit, for a
search warrant, setting forth factually the actual conditions and circumstances
that provide a reasonable basis for believing that a nuisance or violation of
this Code exists on the premises and, if the Court is satisfied as to the
matter set forth in such affidavit, the Court may authorize the issuance of a
search warrant permitting access to and inspection of that part of the premises
on which the nuisance or violation exists.
   A warrant for access may be issued by the Court upon affidavit of the
Property Maintenance Officer establishing the grounds therefor pursuant to
Section
1309.22 of this Code.
(Ord. 1982-257. Passed 12-21-82.)
   1309.12  PROCEDURE WHERE VIOLATION IS DISCOVERED.
   Where a violation of the Codified Ordinances or the regulations hereunder is
found, the Property Maintenance Officer shall at his/her option follow one of
the two methods herein set forth for the correction of the violation.
   (a)   Criminal Procedure. 
      (1)   Notice of Violation.  A written notice shall be served upon the
person responsible, which may include the owner, owner's agent, occupant or
operator for the correction of the violation.
      (2)   Contents of Notice.  The notice shall specify the violation or the
violations committed, what shall be done to correct the same, a reasonable
period of time, not to exceed forty-five days, to correct or abate the
violation, the right of the person served to request a hearing and that the
notice shall become an order of the Property Maintenance Officer in ten days
after service, unless a hearing is requested pursuant to the provisions in
subsection (4) hereof.
      (3)   Service of Notice.  Notice may be served personally or by certified
and regular mail, addressed to the last known address of the person to be
served. Where it is ascertained that the owner does not reside on the premises,
the last known address shall be the address of the owner as shown in the office
of the Lake County Auditor. If the last known address cannot be ascertained,
the notice may be posted on the outside front entrance of the building. The
Property Maintenance Officer shall file and provide notice to any owner and/or
occupant of any violation at any address other than the last known address
provided hereunder if such other address is filed with the Property Maintenance
Officer personally or by certified mail addressed to the Property Maintenance
Officer. Date of service of the notice shall be determined (where service is by
mail) as two days following the day of mailing for notices to addresses within
the City; and as of the fourth day after the day of mailing for notices to
addresses outside the City. Where the day of service would fall upon a Sunday
or other day when mail is not ordinarily delivered, then the day of service
shall be the next regular delivery day.
      (4)   Notice to Become Order Unless Hearing is Requested.  Within ten
days of the date of service of a notice, the notice shall constitute a final
order unless any person affected by the notice requests a hearing thereon
before the Board of Zoning Appeals, serving a written request within the ten
day period, in person or by mail, on the Chairman of the Board of Zoning
Appeals. Such request for a hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
set forth briefly the grounds or reasons on which the request for a hearing is
based and the factual matters contained in the notice of violation which are to
be disputed at the hearing. The Chairman of the Board of Zoning Appeals upon
receipt of the request shall, within thirty days therefrom and upon five days
notice to the party aggrieved, set the matter for hearing.
      (5)   Determination at Hearing.  At any hearing provided hereunder, the
Chairman of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be vested with all the powers
provided by law to compel the attendance of witnesses and parties in interest
by the issuance and service of subpoena; to require by subpoena the production
of books, records or other documents at any such hearing which may be pertinent
to matters to be determined by him; and to enforce any such subpoena or secure
any other for the enforcement of any such subpoena, as provided by law. The
Board shall make a decision no later than thirty (30) days after the hearing. 
The Board of Zoning Appeals, at its next meeting, shall issue an order either
incorporating the determinations and directions contained in the notice,
modifying the same or withdrawing the notice.
      (6)   Extension of Time for Correction.  The Property Maintenance Officer
may extend the time for correction or abatement of the violations for an
additional period of time not to exceed thirty days.
      (7)   Noncompliance With Notice.  Whenever the person responsible for a
structure or premises fails, neglects or refuses to comply with any notice of
the Property Maintenance Officer that becomes a final order, as provided in
subsection (4) hereof, the Property Maintenance Officer may advise the Director
of Law of the circumstances, and request him to institute an appropriate legal
action to compel compliance.
      (8)   Referral of Violations.  Any violation of any ordinance other than
this Code, discovered by the Property Maintenance Officer, or his/her designee,
shall be reported to the official or agency responsible for the enforcement of
such ordinance.
   (b)   Civil Procedure. 
      (1)   Citation Violations.  The Property Maintenance Officer, or his/her
designee, pursuant to Section
1309.10  shall have the authority to issue an instant citation to the owner
and/or occupant of the property on which the violation occurs for violations of
codified ordinances of the City.
      (2)   Warning Citation.  Upon observation of a violation not deemed to be
egregious and if similar prior violations have not occurred on the property or
the presence of multiple violations do not exist on the property, a warning
citation shall be securely placed upon the front entrance to the building. 
      (3)   Issuance of Citation.  If an egregious condition exists or if the
owner and/or occupant of the property fails to correct a violation within ten
(10) calendar days following placement of a warning citation upon the property,
a citation with a civil penalty in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) may be
issued by  the Property Maintenance Officer, or his/her designee, and shall be
securely placed upon the front entrance of the building and mailed to the owner
at the address as shown in the office of the Lake County Auditor.  If not paid
within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the Citation, then the civil
penalty shall be increased to one hundred dollars ($100.00).
      (4)   Content of Citation.  All citations for violations shall be written
on a pre-printed form approved by the Property Maintenance Officer, which shall
include all information necessary to identify the nature of the violation, the
address where it occurred, and the owner and/or occupant of the premises at the
address.
      (5)   Payment of Citation.  The owner and/or occupant shall appear at the
City of Willoughby Building Department to pay the fine for such violation, in
person, through a designated representative, or postmarked by mail, within
thirty days (30) days after the issuance of such real property citation,
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays excepted.
      (6)   Collection of Fines.  In the event the owner and/or occupant of the
property does not reimburse the City for the civil penalty incurred in
furtherance of this section within sixty (60) days from the date of the
Citation, the Director of Finance shall certify such fines to the Auditor of
Lake County with the request that such amount be entered upon the tax duplicate
and become a lien upon such lands, from and after the date of the entry, and be
collected as other taxes and returned to the City according to law.
      (7)   Appeal of Citation.  The owner and/or occupant of a property
aggrieved by any civil penalty imposed pursuant to this Section may appeal to
the Board of Zoning Appeals by sending a detailed written explanation of the
grounds for the appeal, along with payment in full of the civil penalty, to the
Property Maintenance Officer within twenty-one (21) business days of the date
of the citation.  The Property Maintenance Officer will forward the payment to
the Finance Department, which will credit such payment.  The Board of Zoning
Appeals shall issue a written decision affirming, notifying, reversing,
revoking or vacating the civil penalty within forty-five (45) calendar days of
receipt of the written explanation of the grounds for the appeal.  In the event
the civil penalty is reversed, revoked, vacated, or decreased in amount, the
appellant shall be reimbursed for payment of the portion of the civil penalty
vacated or decreased.  Each Citation received must be appealed separately. 
      (8)   Correction of Violation.  In the event the violation is not
corrected within thirty (30) days and there has been no appeal of the Citation
or the appeal is made and resolved in favor of the City, the City reserves the
right to institute the criminal proceedings pursuant to Section
1309.12 (a)(7).
         (Ord. 2011-18.  Passed 2-15-11.)
   (c)   In addition to the civil remedies provided in Section
1309.12(b), the Property Maintenance Officer shall have the authority to issue
a citation to the owner or occupant of the property on which the violation
occurs, stating the full nature and extent of the violation, the Codified
Ordinance that has been violated, and informing the property owner or occupant
that if the violations are not corrected within thirty (30) days of the date of
violation, the City may at its option:
      (1)   Correct the violation using City personnel;
      (2)   Employ a private contractor to correct the violation;
      (3)   In the event the violation is corrected by City personnel or a
private contractor, the property owner or responsible party shall pay the cost
of correction.
         All expenses or costs incurred in correcting the violation shall be
paid by the City and an invoice for such expenses and costs, including
administrative costs, shall be submitted to the property owner or responsible
party for reimbursement.
      (4)   In the event that correction of the violation requires the removal
of personal property from the premises, the removed items shall be sold at the
best price obtainable and the proceeds will be credited against the cost of
correction.  Any funds in excess of the cost of correction shall be refunded to
the land owner or responsible party.
      (5)   In addition to all other fees, a re-inspection fee of fifty dollars
($50.00) shall be charged if it is determined that the property maintenance
violation has not been corrected within the stated time, or the required work
is not in accordance with applicable ordinances or building codes.
      (6)   Collection of costs.  If in the event the owner, lessee, agent or
tenant of the property does not reimburse the City for the net expenses
incurred in furtherance of this section within thirty (30) days from the date
of the invoice, the Director of Finance shall certify such expenses and costs
to the Auditor of Lake County with the request that such amount be entered upon
the tax duplicate and become a  lien upon such lands, from and after the date
of the entry, and be collected as other taxes and returned to the City
according to law.  (Ord. 2013-125.  Passed 11-12-13; Ord. 2018-18.  Passed 2-6-
18.)
   1309.13  POWER TO VARY OR MODIFY PROVISIONS.
   The Property Maintenance Officer shall have the power to withhold strict
enforcement of the requirements of this Code upon written application therefor
by an owner, occupant or operator, after making a determination that:
(a)    Any variation or modification of structure or use approved by the
Property Maintenance Officer shall not in any material way alter the standards
of this Code and cannot affect detrimentally the health or safety or the
welfare of the occupants or owners of adjacent premises or of the immediate
neighborhood, and strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary
hardship on the owner or operator because it would compel expenditures on the
premises which would be substantially disproportionate to any benefit to the
health, safety or welfare that might be derived therefrom.
(b)    The owner or operator is without any practical or feasible means to
comply with the strict provisions of this Code.
(c)    The strict enforcement of the provisions of this Code would require the
installation of repairs and improvements estimated to exceed five hundred
dollars ($500.00) in cost, and the premises subject to the Code are
contemplated for acquisition or are within an area where acquisition is
contemplated by a public agency having the power of eminent domain, and there
is reasonable likelihood that such premises will be acquired and razed or moved
within a period of two years, and provided, however, that any waiver of the
provisions of this Code shall be canceled and the Property Maintenance Officer
shall strictly enforce this Code if it shall be ascertained, subsequent to the
granting of the waiver, that the premises are, in fact, not to be acquired for
any public use or purpose.
(Ord. 1982-257. Passed 12-21-82.)
   1309.14  RIGHT TO HEARING WHERE APPLICATION IS DENIED.
   Upon denial of any such application, the owner, operator or applicant may
request a hearing which shall be held in accordance with the provisions of
Section
1309.12(c).
(Ord. 1982-257. Passed 12-21-82.)
   1309.15  APPLICATION NOT TO CONSTITUTE A DEFENSE OR STAY.
   Such application shall not constitute a defense of any violation of this
Code concerning any proceedings which are pending in the Municipal Court when
the application is filed, nor shall any variance or modification allowed
hereunder constitute a vested right against any ordinance enacted hereinafter
by Council compelling strict enforcement of any provisions of this Code.
(Ord. 1982-257. Passed 12-21-82.)
   1309.16  RECORD OF VARIATIONS OR MODIFICATIONS GRANTED.
   Where variations or modifications are approved of any section of this Code
by the Property Maintenance Officer or by action of the Zoning Board of Appeals
or of any court, a written record thereof stating the name of the applicant,
the address of the premises, the variation or modification approved, the date
of approval, and the reasons therefor to satisfy the provisions contained
herein shall be prepared by the Property Maintenance Officer and filed both
under the section or sections of this Code to which the variation or
modification applies and under the address of the premises; and such files
shall be available for public inspection in the office of the Property
Maintenance Officer during regular business hours.
(Ord. 1982-257. Passed 12-21-82.)
   1309.17  APPLICATION FOR INSPECTION.
   Whenever an owner, operator, occupant, a bona fide prospective purchaser,
mortgagee or a bona fide prospective occupant shall apply to the Property
Maintenance Officer for an inspection in order to ascertain if any section of
this Code has been violated, the Property Maintenance Officer shall, upon
payment of the fee hereunder stated, cause an inspection to be made of the
premises and issue an informational certificate or report of the inspection to
the applicant, indicating therein any violations of this Code on the premises.
The applicant for such inspection shall state in writing his full name, his
residence and the reasons and basis for which the inspection is requested. The
Property Maintenance Officer may deny the application for failure to comply
with this requirement.
(Ord. 1982-257. Passed 12-21-82.)
   1309.18  APPLICATION FOR STATUS REPORT.
   Where, in lieu of an inspection, an owner, operator, occupant, lessee, bona
fide prospective purchaser, mortgagee or bona fide prospective occupant
requests a status report as to whether or not there are any known violations
presently pending on such premises, upon payment of the fee prescribed herein
and the written request, a copy of any notice or order or any violation then
pending shall be sent to the applicant.
(Ord. 1982-257 Passed 12-21-82 )
   1309.19  INSPECTION AND STATUS REPORT FEES.
   (a)    The minimum fee for any inspection made under Section
1309.17 shall be fifty dollars ($50.00).  Any dwellings of more than ten units
or rooming units shall pay an additional fee of five dollars ($5.00) for each
unit in excess of ten.

1309.18 shall be five dollars ($5.00). (Ord. 2018-18.  Passed 2-6-18.)

make repairs or otherwise improve his property and is unable to comply with
this Code without having right of access to the building or premises through or
across adjoining premises not owned by him or under his control, and where
right of access has been refused the owner, operator or occupant; or where the
owner or person responsible for granting permission cannot be found or located;
then, upon the filing of an affidavit setting forth the facts with the Property
Maintenance Officer, the Property Maintenance Officer shall serve a five day
notice, in writing, of a hearing upon the owner, the operator or the occupant
of any adjoining premises affected by the application.
   (b)    Hearing.  On the day fixed for hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall provide opportunity for the owner, operator or occupant of the adjoining
property or properties to state why access should not be granted across such
adjoining properties.
(Ord. 1982-257. Passed 12-21-82.)
   1309.21  ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE AND CONDITIONS.
   If the Zoning Board of Appeals determines that access is deemed absolutely
necessary for compliance with this Code, then the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
issue a certificate of necessity setting forth therein the person or persons to
whom the certificate shall apply, such conditions as shall be necessary to
protect the adjoining property, reasonable time limits during which such
certificate shall operate, precautions to be taken to avoid damages and, where
the Zoning Board of Appeals deems proper, that a bond be procured at the
expense of any persons seeking access to secure the adjoining property against
damage to persons or property arising out of such rights of access. The bond
shall not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) unless conditions deemed

Maintenance Officer may, upon affidavit, apply to the Municipal Court for a
warrant under the procedure set forth in Section
1309.11(b) authorizing access to the premises under appropriate conditions and
circumstances as provided under Section

(Ord. 1982-257.  Passed 12-21-82.)
   1309.23  SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or word
contained in this Code shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever,

are hereby declared to be severable.

1322.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Willoughby has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base.  Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.  In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (b)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (c)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (d)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Willoughby as identified in this ordinance, including any additional areas of
special flood hazard annexed by the City of Willoughby.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps
are adopted:
      (1)     Flood Insurance Study Lake County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
effective February 3, 2010.
      (2)   Flood Insurance Rate Map Lake County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
effective February 3, 2010.
      (3)       Other studies and/or maps which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (4)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Willoughby as required by Section
1322.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations.  Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Willoughby City Hall, One Public Square, Willoughby,
OH  44094.
   
   (e)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement, but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (f)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (g)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Willoughby, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (h)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof,
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. 2010-6.  Passed 1-19-10.)
1322.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   "Accessory Structure" - A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   "Appeal" - A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   "Base Flood" - The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   "Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)" - The water surface elevation
of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988,
and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   "Basement" - Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   "Development" - Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating or drilling operations, or
storing of equipment or materials.
   (g)   "Enclosure below the Lowest Floor" - See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)" - The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (i)   "Fill" - A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (j)   "Flood or Flooding" - A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
        (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
        (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
   (k)   "Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)" - Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (l)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" - An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (m)   "Flood Insurance Risk Zones" - Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:     Special flood hazard areas inundated
by the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (4)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (n)   "Flood Insurance Study (FIS)" - The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (o)   "Flood Protection Elevation (FPE)" - The base flood elevation plus one
foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (p)   "Floodway" - A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.  The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and
is usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity
flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to
high erosion forces.
   (q)   "Freeboard" - A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (r)   "Historic structure" - Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (s)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" - An analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (t)   "Letter of Map Change (LOMC)" - A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) - A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)    Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) - A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) - A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (u)   "Lowest floor" - The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (v)   "Manufactured home" - A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (w)   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" - The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (x)   "New construction" - Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Willoughby
Flood Insurance Rate Map, January 16, 1981 and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (y)   "Person" - Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (z)   "Recreational vehicle" - A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (aa)   "Registered Professional Architect" - A person registered to engage
in the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (bb)   "Registered Professional Engineer" - A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (cc)   "Registered Professional Surveyor" - A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   "Special Flood Hazard Area" - Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (ee)   "Start of construction" - The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (ff)   "Structure" - A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (gg)   "Substantial Damage" - Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (hh)   "Substantial Improvement" - Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (ii)   "Variance" - A grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (jj)   "Violation" - The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 2010-6.  Passed 1-20-10.)

   Any proposed action exempt from filing for a floodplain development permit
is also exempt from the standards of these regulations.
   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Willoughby flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1322.01(d) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1322.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1322.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1322.03 (j)(1)A.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or a Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1322.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (4)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
      (5)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.  Additionally, the Floodplain
Administrator may implement other measures to assist with the substantial
damage determination and subsequent repair process. These measures include
issuing press releases, public service announcements, and other public
information materials related to the floodplain development permits and repair
of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal, state, and local
agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations; providing owners of
damaged structures materials and other information related to the proper repair
of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and assist owners of
substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of Compliance insurance
claims.

"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with The

when approved by the Service Director, or designee, and a temporary fence, walk
or covered walk is constructed and maintained in accordance with the provisions
of this Code.
   (b)   Cleaning. 
      (1)   The owner, or his agent, upon the completion of demolition shall

persons. When located less than five feet from the street, a fence or other
barrier shall be erected when required by the Chief Building Inspector, or

protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the public.
      (2)   All fences, barricades or temporary structures of any kind located
on public streets, alleys or sidewalks, shall be so constructed as not to
obstruct vision at the intersection of streets.

the sidewalk or is located less than one quarter of the height of the building
from any street or alley, unless the street is officially closed during the
demolition.
      (2)   Covered walkway shall be constructed to afford an unobstructed
walkway for pedestrians, not less than eight feet high and four feet wide. Each
side of the walk shall be provided with smooth handrails.
      (3)   The temporary or permanent sidewalk shall be covered along the
entire length of the project, and be in use at all times that demolition
activity extends above the second floor level.
      (4)   Where in the opinion of the Chief Building Inspector and Service
Director a covered walk is not necessary, a permit may be issued to block-off

   1335.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   Except as otherwise specifically provided for, the following provisions
shall prevail in the issuance of all types of permits.  The Building and Zoning
Inspector, before issuing any permit, is authorized to charge and collect the
fees and deposits specified in this chapter.  The fees prescribed herein shall
be additive and unless otherwise specifically provided separate fees shall be
paid for each of the items listed.
(a)   Calculating Aggregate Floor Area.  The aggregate floor area shall be the
sum of the gross horizontal areas of the several floors, including attached
garages, basements, cellars and attics that are at least fifty percent
habitable.  All horizontal dimensions shall be taken from the exterior faces of
walls, including enclosed porches and stoops.
(b)   Establishing Cost.  Where the permit fee is based upon the cost of the
work done under the permit, such costs shall be the actual cost as certified by
the owner or authorized representative of the owner, and as approved by the
Building and Zoning Inspector.
The Building and Zoning Inspector may, at any time up to three months after the
completion of the building, require the submission of authoritative estimates
or actual cost data to substantiate the estimated cost stated in the
application for a permit, and require the payment of additional fees when it is
demonstrated that the actual cost of the work is in excess of the estimated
cost upon which permit fees were based.
(c)   Time Limitation.  Any permit issued shall become invalid unless the work
authorized by it has been commenced within six months after its issuance or if
the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of
one year after the time the work is commenced.  For cause, one or more
extensions of time for periods not exceeding ninety days each may be allowed in
writing by the Building and Zoning Inspector.
(d)   Refund of Permit Fees.  Whenever the work for which a permit has been
issued has been abandoned and is not to be done, such permit may be returned to
the Building and Zoning Inspector for cancellation and, after a deduction of
twenty dollars ($20.00) from the permit fee has been made, one-half of the
balance of the permit fee, if any, shall be refunded.
(e)   Refund of Cash Deposits.  Cash deposits shall be refunded only after the
Building and Zoning Inspector, the Director of Public Service and the City
Engineer have deducted all charges for all damages or inspections and after a
determination is made that no future damages or inspections will be necessary
or are reasonably foreseeable.
(f)    Certificate of Occupancy.  The builder, owner or other person having
control of a building under construction is prohibited from allowing such
building to be occupied until it has been finally inspected and approved by the
Building and Zoning Inspector and a certificate of occupancy has been applied
for, in writing, and has been issued by the Building and Zoning Inspector.

that such site has been abandoned. The owner shall have thirty days from
receipt of said notice to show, by a preponderance of evidence, that the 
antenna, antenna structure, and/or broadcast receiving antenna has been in use
or under repair during the period. If the owner fails to show that the antenna,
antenna structure, and/or broadcast receiving antenna has been in use or under
repair during the period, the City Council shall issue a final determination of
abandonment for the site. Upon issuance of the final  determination of
abandonment, the owner shall, within seventy-five days, dismantle and remove
the antenna, antenna structure, and/or broadcast receiving antenna.
(f)    Security.  To secure the obligation set forth in this section, the
applicant and/or owner shall post a bond. The amount shall be determined by the
City Council based on the anticipated cost of removal of the antenna, antenna
structure, and/or broadcast receiving antenna.

THIS STRUCTURE IS IN A DANGEROUS CONDITION AND HAS BEEN CONDEMNED AND ITS USE
HAS BEEN PROHIBITED BY THE BUILDING INSPECTOR.
   Such notice shall remain posted until the required repairs are made or

   The owner, agent or person in control of a building, structure or portion
thereof for which a notice of violation and order has been issued pursuant to
Section
1341.03  shall, without payment of a fee, have the right to appeal from the
notice and order of the Building and Zoning Inspector and to appear before the
Board of Building Code Appeals at a specified time and place to show cause why
such owner, agent or person in control should not comply with such notice and
order. The procedure for taking such appeal shall be governed by Section 112 of
the Residential Code of Ohio for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings as adopted

building or structure or portion thereof for which a notice of violation and
order has been issued pursuant to Section
1341.03 cannot be found within the stated period of time or has not appealed
such notice and order, and fails, neglects or refuses to comply with such
notice and order, the Building and Zoning Inspector may take any necessary
action to demolish and remove the unsafe building or structure or may advise
the Director of Law of the facts in the case.  The Director may, in the event
that he believes that such notice and order cannot be effectively given due to
the incompetency or disability of such owner, agent or person in control,
institute action in a court of competent jurisdiction to accomplish the
purposes of this chapter.  The Inspector shall, in addition, give written
notice informing the owner, or person or entities that claim an ownership in
the land and building or structure, or agent or persons in control of the
building or structure, mortgagee of record and any lien holder of record of the
City’s intention to repair and rehabilitate or demolish and remove the unsafe
building or structure at least thirty days prior to such intended action by the
City, provided, however, that in the cases of emergency set forth in Section
1341.07, less than thirty days notice may be given.

   1341.07  EMERGENCY ACTION.
   (a)    In cases of emergency that, in the opinion of the Building and Zoning
Inspector, involve immediate danger to human life or health, the Inspector
shall promptly cause any unsafe structure to be made safe or removed. For this
purpose he may at once enter such structure, the land on which it stands or any
abutting land or structure, with such assistance and at such cost as he deems
necessary. He may order adjacent structures and premises to be vacated and
protect the public by an appropriate fence or such other means as he deems
necessary, and for such purpose he may close a public or private way.
   (b)    The emergency action provided for in subsection (a) hereof shall not
be undertaken by the Inspector except in the most urgent of situations and he
shall, prior to invoking such emergency authority, advise the Director of
Public Safety and the Director of Law of his intended action.
(Bill 1976-33. Passed 5-18-76.)
   1341.08  COSTS.

use of employees, materials or equipment of the City, any costs arising out of
contracts for labor, material or equipment, and costs associated with ownership
verification and costs of service of notice or publication as required under
Section
1341.03.
   If the owner fails to pay the total costs as determined above within thirty
days after the receipt from the Director of Finance of a statement of the total
costs so incurred, the Clerk of Council shall certify the total costs, together
with a proper description of the lands to the County Auditor for placement upon
the tax duplicate. Upon such occurrence, the costs are a lien upon such lands
and shall be collected as other taxes and returned to the City as set forth in
Ohio R.C. 715.261. Notwithstanding the method of collection set forth in this
section, the Director of Law may take any action necessary to collect the costs
from the owner or other responsible party or parties.

Appropriateness in the manner prescribed in Section
1347.08. No sign permit shall be issued for any sign or display to be erected

   1347.08  ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   The procedure for the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness
(hereinafter referred to as a "Certificate") shall be as follows:
   (a)   When the owner or user of a property within a preservation district,
or an otherwise listed property, desires to make any environmental change,
including the construction, reconstruction, demolition, erection of a sign or
landscaping, he shall first obtain a Certificate from the Board. A Certificate
shall also be obtained for proposed tree removal within a preservation
district. A Certificate shall not be required for removal by the City of trees
within street rights of way.
   (b)   If the proposed work requires a building or a sign permit or a
demolition permit, the owner or user shall file an application through the
Building Department which shall then refer the matter to the Board.
      (1)   If the demolition, change or sign is not incompatible with nor does
it adversely affect any historic, architectural or environmental feature of the
property, or physically related properties which are also within a preservation
district or otherwise listed, and does not violate the spirit and purpose of
this chapter, then the Board shall issue a Certificate and the owner or user
may proceed.
      (2)   In the event the Board shall not commence review of the application
within thirty (30) calendar days after it has been filed, the application shall
be considered approved.
   (c)   If, after due consideration by the Board, it is determined that the
demolition, change or sign would have an adverse effect on properties subject
to the provisions of this chapter, the Board shall state reasons for such
disapproval in writing and transmit the written statement to the applicant
together with recommendations the Board may have made for appropriate changes. 
      (1)   The Board shall make every effort by working with the applicant,
for a period not to exceed six (6) weeks, to develop a proposal for such
demolition, change or sign that shall be compatible with the terms of this
chapter so that a certificate can be issued by the Board.
      (2)   At any time during this period, the Board may refer the application
to Council or, if no satisfactory alternative has been worked out by the end of
the six (6)-week period, then the Board shall refer the matter to Council
together with the Board's written recommendations concerning the application.
      (3)   The Council functioning under its own rules of procedure, shall
give due consideration to the findings and recommendations of the Board, the
owner or user, the views expressed by persons participating in public hearings
which Council may hold. Upon its conclusion, Council shall determine whether or
not a Certificate shall be issued.
      (4)   After twelve (12) months, the process of application and appeal may
be repeated. The owner or user may be required to delay his proposed
construction, reconstruction or alteration for up to one year by Council.
      (5)   If the application involves demolition, the owner or user may be
required to delay his work for up to two (2) years by Council.
      (6)   Sign applications may be permanently denied by Council. 
   (d)   Alternate Plan.
      (1)   In the case of an inappropriate change, sign proposal or landscape
plan, the Board shall, during this waiting period, attempt to work out an
alternate plan with the owner or user, or his representative, that is
acceptable to all parties.
      (2)   In the case of a proposed demolition, the Board shall attempt to
find practicable alternatives to such demolition. 
   (e)   Where the position of the Board is overruled by Council, a Certificate
shall automatically be issued upon such action.
   (f)   Within thirty calendar days after the date of filing of an application
for a Certificate, the Board shall decide whether the proposed change, sign or
landscaping is appropriate. The Board is obligated to act as quickly as
possible on all applications so as to cause as little inconvenience to the
owner or user as is possible, and shall attempt, where the proposed change,
sign, display or landscaping is inappropriate, to keep the waiting period as
brief as it may be. Where a recommendation of disapproval is made to Council,
the reasons shall be set forth in writing.
      (Ord. 2020-21.  Passed 2-18-20.)
   1347.09  CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF
APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)    In considering the appropriateness of any environmental changes,
including signs, displays or landscaping, the Board shall take into account, in
addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural style
and general design, arrangement, texture, material and color of the proposed
changes as they relate to the property in its present condition, and shall also
consider the relation thereof to the same or related factors in other
properties, objects and areas in the immediate vicinity.
(Ord. 1988-217. Passed 11-1-88.)
   (b)    Attention shall be taken to avoid the environmentally harmful effect

maintenance or repair of any property, area, or object within a preservation
district, or otherwise listed under the provisions of this chapter, provided
such work involves no change in material, design, texture, color or outer
appearance; nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to prevent any
environmental change, including the construction, reconstruction, alteration,
demolition, or landscaping of any feature which, in view of the proper
authority acting lawfully, is required for the public safety because of an
unsafe or dangerous condition. However, no demolition permit shall be issued
except upon the certification of a registered professional engineer or
architect that the structure of a building is unsound or would need major
reinforcement to be brought under building code structural requirements,
considering a use that the building would reasonably lend itself to.

            (Ord. 2018-119.  Passed 9-18-18.)
   1351.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls.  The
SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). 
   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment
pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction.  Perimeter controls must be installed two working
days prior to commencement of construction.  The approved plan must be
implemented until the site reaches final stabilization.  All properties
adjacent to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil
erosion and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands.
   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of contractor
(s) responsible for implementation the SWP3 and providing that information to
the Willoughby Engineer. The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact stormwater runoff.  The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3. The applicant shall review the SWP3 with the primary contractor prior
to commencement of construction activities and keep a SWP3 training log to
demonstrate that this review had occurred.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities.  The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)   NON-STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION MEASURES: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable.  Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a 50-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the state, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible (e.g., stream
crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation
and restoration).  Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment
removal and maximize stormwater infiltration. 
   (b)   EROSION CONTROL PRACTICES: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils.  The amount of soil
exposed during construction activity shall be minimized.  A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3.  The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year.  Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover. 
      Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization.  Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization
 
Area requiring permanent stabilization       Time frame to apply erosion
                                             controls

Disturbed areas that will be idle over Prior to November 1 or the onset of
winter.                                winter weather, whichever occurs first.
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed.
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels.  Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   RUNOFF CONTROL PRACTICES.  The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion.  Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices.  These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive
flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)   SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICES.  The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site.  Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days.  Such practices
may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain
inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to
a sediment settling pond.  The design, installation and maintenance of erosion
and sediment controls shall address factors such as the amount, frequency,
intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater
runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes
expected to be present on the site.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.  Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are
not considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment settling pond.
      Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing.  They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized.  As construction progresses and the
topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the City of Willoughby Engineer
and/or the Lake County SWCD, is required for any one of the following
conditions:
         A.   Concentrated stormwater runoff;
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas which exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3), inlet protection, or other sediment barriers;
         C.   Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land.
Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a sediment trap or
sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater and Land
Development.  The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a sediment
trap shall be limited to less than 5 acres.  Contributing drainage areas of 5
acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin.  An equivalent best
management practice may be utilized upon approval from the City of Willoughby. 
The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone.  The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 1,800
cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area.  The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum 48-
hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always withdraw runoff
from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle.  As such, a skimmer
discharge device consistent with Rainwater and Land Development shall be
provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide both a
sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure shall be
constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest edition
of Rainwater and Land Development.
When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used as
temporary sediment trapping BMPs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase and
until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the City of Willoughby.
The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of sediment
basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the pond
provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering zone.  As
such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be no
discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage zone
and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only occur
through the skimmer.
The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods: 
Method 1:   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000ft3 per
disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
Method 2:   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with RUSLE or other generally
accepted erosion prediction model.
When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone
must be less than or equal to five (5) feet.  The configuration between the
inlets and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at least two
units of length for each one unit of width ? 2:1 length-to-width ratio;
however, a length to width ratio of ? 4:1 is recommended.  Sediment must be
removed from the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity of the
sediment storage zone has been completely filled by sediment accumulations. 
This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin
depth.  When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider
public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the
sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.  The use of a combination of sediment
and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is
encouraged.
      (3)    Silt fence and diversions.  Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties
and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow.  Where intended
to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and
shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff.  The relationship between the
maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in
Table 3 below.  Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the
size of the permissible drainage area.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                > 20% but < 50%
      (4)    Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the City of Willoughby, but their use shall not exceed the
limitations indicated in Table 3 above.  Detail drawings and plan notes shall
specify the diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative
perimeter controls if used instead of silt fence.
      (5)   Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes.  Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to 10 acres.
      (6)    Inlet protection.  Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems.  All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond.  Straw or hay
bales and filter socks around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet
protection.
      (7)    Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control.  Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled.  These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area.  These
entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances shall
be kept free of sediment tracked off site.  Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall
be cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site.  If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
Based on site conditions, City of Willoughby Engineer and/or the Lake County
SWCD may require additional best management practices to control off site
tracking and dust.  These additional BMPs may include:
         C.   Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
         D.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas.  Wash water from
these areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-
settling pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1351.09 (g) of this regulation.  No surfactants or detergents may be used to
wash vehicles.
         E.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions.  The City of Willoughby Engineer and/or
the Lake County SWCD may require dust controls including the use of water
trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of
disturbed areas, and regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (8)   Surface Waters of the State protection.  Construction vehicles
shall avoid water  resources.  A 50 foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be
provided around surface waters of the state unless infeasible.  If it is
infeasible to provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the
SWP3 shall comply with the stabilization requirements in
1351.09(G)(1) for areas within 50 feet of a surface water or riparian or
wetland setbacks if applicable, whichever is greater; and minimize soil
compaction and, unless infeasible, preserve topsoil.  [Communities with
riparian and/or wetland setbacks include the following language:  If a riparian
or wetland setback is greater than 50 feet, no disturbance of natural
vegetation shall occur within the riparian or wetland setback unless a variance
to the riparian or wetland setback regulation has been granted.] If the
applicant is permitted to disturb areas within 50 feet of a water resource, the
following conditions shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in water resources
or wetlands.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
         G.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands.  The flow
should be released such that no erosion occurs downslope.  Level spreaders may
need to be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
         H.   Protected areas or critical areas, including wetlands and
riparian areas shall be physically marked in the field prior to earth
disturbing activities.
      (9)   Modifying controls.  If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a  control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the
applicant shall replace or modify the control for site conditions. 
   (f)   NON-SEDIMENT POLLUTANT CONTROLS:  No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in stormwater runoff.  The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources, wetlands or
the MS4.  These practices shall include but are not limited to the following: 
      (1)   Waste Materials: A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or water of the
state is prohibited.  A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available. 
      (3)   Disposal of Other Wastewaters:  The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the state is prohibited.  The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
      (4)   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area.  A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest
containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up
spills.  The SWP3 shall contain spill prevention and response procedures and
these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction meeting. 
      (5)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.  The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      (6)   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Discovery of previously
unknown contaminated soils onsite shall be self-reported to Ohio EPA and local
authorities.  Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of
properly.  Runoff from contaminated soils shall not be discharged from the
site.  Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid waste
landfill sites or redevelopment sites.  Where construction activities are to
occur on sites with contamination from previous activities, operators shall be
aware that concentrations of materials that meet other criteria (i.e. not
considered a Hazardous Waste, meeting Voluntary Action Program (VAP standards))
may still result in stormwater discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality
Standards.  Such discharges are not authorized by this Code. Control measures
which may be utilized to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to:
 
         A.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated runoff
and prevent discharge.
         B.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer with
the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
         C.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or other
such methods to prevent storm water from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building materials,
building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Applicants may
also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, Safety Response Plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site. 
   (g)    COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS.  The SWP3 shall be consistent
with applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic
system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open
burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils
located within the development area.
   (h)    TRENCH AND GROUND WATER CONTROL. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities.  If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through
a sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site.  Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice.  Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge. 
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (i)         INTERNAL INSPECTIONS.  All controls on the site shall be
inspected a at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after
any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The
inspection frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire
site is temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions
(e.g., site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of
inspection requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions
are expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been
attained from the City of Willoughby Engineer and/or the Lake SWCD and all of
the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
      (2)   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
      (3)   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
      (4)   For sites that will not be completed by October 1, a Pre-Winter
Stabilization Meeting shall be held by the landowner and the developer,
engineer and contractor of the project and the City of Willoughby prior to
October 1, in order to plan and approve winter erosion and sediment controls as
defined in the most current online edition of Rainwater and Land Development. 
The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required.  Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls. Certified inspection reports shall be submitted to the Willoughby
Engineer within seven (7) working days from the inspection and retained at the
development site.
      These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system. 
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly.  The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the City of Willoughby or an alternate
form acceptable to the City of Willoughby Engineer.  The inspection form shall
include:
         A.   The inspection date.
         B.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
         C.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred. 
         D.   Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring
at the time of inspection.
         E.   Locations of:
            1.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
            2.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
            3.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate
for a particular location.
            4.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
         F.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
SWP3 and implementation dates.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands. 
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (5)   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
     (j)   MAINTENANCE.  The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements.  All BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. 
All sediment control practices must be maintained in a functional condition
until all up slope areas they control reach final stabilization.  The applicant
shall provide a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the
continued performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party
and adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the City
of Willoughby Engineer.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When BMPs require repair or maintenance.  If an internal inspection
reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of a
sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three (3) days
of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within three (3) to ten (10) days of the inspection as determined by
the Willoughby Engineer or site inspector.
      (3)   When BMPs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in accordance with the
schedule, the control practice must be implemented within ten (10) days from
the date of the inspection.  If the internal inspection reveals that the
planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (k)    FINAL STABLIZATION. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
City of Willoughby Engineer.  Once a definable area has achieved final
stabilization, the applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further
inspection requirement applies to that portion of the site.  Final
stabilization also requires the installation of permanent (post-construction)
stormwater control measures (SCMs).  Obligations under this ordinance shall not
be completed until installation of post-construction BMPs is verified.
      (Ord. 2018-119.  Passed 9-18-18.)

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion matting.
      (5)   Inlet Protection.  Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets. Straw, hay
bales, and filter socks  are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (6)   Silt Fence and Other Perimeter Controls.  Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the City of Willoughby shall be used to protect
adjacent properties and water resources from sediment discharged via sheet
(diffused) flow.  Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the
permissible drainage area is limited to those indicated in Table 3 in
 1351.09 of these regulations.
        (7)   Internal Inspection and Maintenance.  All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period.  Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When  BMPs require repair or maintenance.  If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         B.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If the
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.   When BMPs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed.  If
the internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection.  If the inspection reveals that
the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement
of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
      (8)   Final Stabilization:  Final stabilization shall be determined by
the City of Willoughby Engineer.

   1352.01  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Willoughby:
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the City of Willoughby to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
        (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation. 
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the City of Willoughby's
future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
1352.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Lake County, and the
City of Willoughby shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for
projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the City of Willoughby Engineer.  Such projects must be designed
to minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of Chapter
1351 Erosion and Sediment Control.  (Ord. 2018-120.  Passed 9-18-18.)

      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots:  Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined under the City of Willoughby Code, shall provide
stormwater management and water quality controls for the development of all
subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot grading and drainage
that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and
maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development runoff patterns,
volumes, and peaks from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources:  SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
1352.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with City of
Willoughby's erosion and sediment control requirements and riparian setback
requirements, all as determined by the City of Willoughby Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels:  All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm.  When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption:  The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1352.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the City of Willoughby
Engineer that the site is part of a larger common plan of development where the
stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by an existing
SCMs, or if the stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by
practices defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by
the City of Willoughby Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance:  All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the City of
Willoughby Engineer as detailed in Section
1352.08.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the City of Willoughby,
SCMs serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and
maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property
owners, by the City of Willoughby.  SCMs serving single lots shall be placed on
these lots, protected within an easement, and maintained by the property
owner. 
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage:  Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and
grubbing practices; and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and
through these areas. Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide
perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected and
ecological functions are maintained.
      (10)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology:  Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters the wetlands in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora.  The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope.  Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology. 
         If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a
hydrological analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed
discharge matches the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics that
support the wetland.
 
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection:  The City of Willoughby Engineer may
allow modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters
only if the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits
from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state,
and local agencies as required in Section
 1352.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with  City of
Willoughby's erosion and sediment control requirements and riparian setback
requirements, all as determined by the City of Willoughby Engineer. At a
minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize
changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat
of upstream and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges:  Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm.  Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City of Willoughby Engineer
that off-site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site
in a manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and
erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow:  The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible.  The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas.  In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the City of Willoughby Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels:  Unless otherwise allowed by the City of Willoughby
Engineer, drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with
vegetated banks and designed to carry the 10 year, 24 hour stormwater runoff
from upstream contributory areas. 
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under City of Willoughby zoning or where the use of an open drainage
system affects public health or safety, all as determined by the City of
Willoughby Engineer. The following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer
systems when necessary: 
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5 year, 24 hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10 year, 24 hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development. 
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the City of Willoughby Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the City of Willoughby:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25 year, 24 hour storm. 
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development. 
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers, cold
water habitat, exceptional warm water habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams.  The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed.  The conduit or
conveyance must to be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource.  The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100 year,
24 hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding:  Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100 year, 24 hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City of Willoughby
must be compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume.  First
consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be
given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new
floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also
be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for
floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing
watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the City of Willoughby, reductions in
volume due to floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of
the development.  Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must
reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The
use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
NOTE:  The Section (8) above should be coordinated with the City of
Willoughby's riparian setback requirements.  The requirement for compensatory
floodplain storage is only in effect when the riparian setback does not include
the entire 100-year floodplain, when the City of Willoughby grants a variance
that allows filling in the floodplain due to site constraints, or when the City
of Willoughby Engineer determines that stream or floodplain restoration is
needed to meet the objectives of this regulation.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation:  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected. 
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control:
      (1)   Direct runoff to an SCM:  The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more of the following SCMs.  These practices are listed in
Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general
performance standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The City of Willoughby Engineer may require a soil engineering
report to be prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed
infiltration facilities meet these performance standards.
For sites less than five (5) acres, but required to create a comprehensive
stormwater management plan, the City of Willoughby Engineer may approve other
SCMs if the applicant demonstrates to the City of Willoughby Engineer's
satisfaction that these SCMs meet the objectives of this regulation.   
         C.   For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the City of Willoughby Engineer may approve
other SCMs if the applicant demonstrates to the City of Willoughby Engineer's
satisfaction that these SCMs meet the objectives of this regulations, and has
prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         D.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the City of Willoughby Engineer may approve SCMs not included in
Table 2 of this regulation, but must show compliance with the current version
of the Ohio Department of Transportation "Location and Design Manual, Volume
Two Drainage Design". 
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs.  SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1). 
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the City of
Willoughby Engineer that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific
hydrologic parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration
characteristics, slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs
controlling the amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-
term hourly records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
               WQV =    C*P*A/12   
               where terms have the following meanings:
               WQV   =    water quality volume in acre-feet
               C    =    runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1
in.
               P   =    0.75 inch precipitation depth
               A   =   area draining into the stormwater practice, in acres.
Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA) for use in determining the WQv can be determined using the list in Table 1
or using the following equation to calculate the runoff coefficient
               C=0.858i3 - 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:   
               i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
                                Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type
of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average.  For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
   
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the stormwater practice for sediment storage.  This volume
shall be incorporated into the sections of stormwater practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   (intentionally left blank)
         D.   Stormwater quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
         E.   (intentionally left blank)
         F.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site. 
Table 2:  Draw Down Times for Stormwater Control Measures
 
Stormwater Control Measure                        Drain Time of WQv
Infiltration Basin or Trench 1                    48 hours
Permeable Pavement - Infiltration 1               48 hours
Permeable Pavement - Extended Detention           24 hours
Extended Detention Facilities
    Dry Extended Detention Basin 2              48 hours
    Wet Extended Detention Basin 3              24 hours
    Constructed Wetlands (above permanent pool) 24 hours
    Bioretention Area/Cell 5,6                  24 hours
    Sand and other Media Filtration 5           24 hours
    Pocket Wetland 7                            24 hours
1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended detention
basins.  Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv. 
3 Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQV .
4 Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water.  Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7 Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv
in a pool and 75% in marshes.  TheEDv above the permanent pool must be equal
to the WQv.
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
in Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site.  No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time. The
outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and
promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            2.    The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation. 
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the
vegetation.  The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). 
The aquatic bench shall be planted with hearty plant species comparable to
wetland vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged inundation.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets.  The forebay and micropool volume shall
be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
            4.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance. 
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
Note: The section below identifies the criteria that are currently be used by
the Ohio EPA to assess the equivalency of alternative practices that are not
listed in Table 2.
      (5)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs:
The applicant may request approval from the City of Willoughby Engineer for the
use of alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant shows to
the satisfaction of the City of Willoughby Engineer that these SCMs are
equivalent in pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness
to those listed in Table 2.  If the site is greater than five (5) acres, or
less than five (5) acres but part of a larger common plan of development or
sale which will disturb five (5) or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio
EPA is necessary.  To demonstrate the equivalency, the applicant must show: 
         A.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State.  The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a (TMDL) has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more fequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the eak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions.  The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement. 
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the City of Willoughby Engineer, the total volume
(acre-feet) of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development
drainage area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the
following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   (intentionally left blank).
            4.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            5.   Rainfall Depth - For the most accurate, up-to-date, location-
specific rainfall data for stormwater design, use the Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States, NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). available online:  http://
hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.
            6.   Temporal Distribution - Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than 1
year.  Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            7.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use. 
            8.   (intentionally left blank)
            9.   (intentionally left blank).
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems. From
the volume determined in Section
1352.09(d)(3)(A), determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
 
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff is: The Critical Storm
Equal to or Greater and Less Than:                    will be:
Than:
---                 10                                1 year
10                  20                                2 year
20                  50                                5 year
50                  100                               10 year
100                 250                               25 year
250                 500                               50 year
500                 ---                               100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm.  The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area.  The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
   (e)    Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects.
      (1)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment
projects shall reduce existing site impervious areas by at least 20 percent.  A
one-for-one credit towards the 20 percent net reduction of impervious area can
be obtained through the use of green roofs. Where site conditions prevent the
reduction of impervious area, SCMs shall be implemented to treat at least 20
percent of the WQv
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and stormwater
quality control facilities are used, ensure a 20 percent net reduction of the
site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv,
or a combination of the two.
Where projects are a combination of new development and redevelopment, the
total water quality volume required to be treated shall be calculated by a
weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at 100 percent
water quality volume and redevelopment at 20 percent.
         Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section
1352.10 may be approved by the City of Willoughby Engineer.
         (Ord. 2018-120.  Passed 9-18-18.)
   1352.10   ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the City of Willoughby determines that site constraints
compromise the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used
