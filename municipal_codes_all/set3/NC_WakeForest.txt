PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Wake 
Forest, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1985 Code, as supplemented through 
September 21, 1999, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source 
of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence 
of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the 
Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any 
section of the 1985 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various 
sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of 
the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first 
section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same 
time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For 
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions 
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter 
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the 
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may 
be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical 
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed 
under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and 
still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the 
particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Code Attorney, and Leesa 
Hampton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the 
other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the 
project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Joyce W. Wilson, CMC/AAE, Town Clerk, for her cooperation and 
assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of 
the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily 
accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's 
affairs.

Editor's note Printed herein is the Charter of the Town of Wake Forest being chapter 273 of the 
Session Laws of 1973, as adopted by the General Assembly on April 26, 1973, and effective on the same 
date. Amendments to the original Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended 
provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the

clarity are indicated by brackets.

pleasure; may sue and be sued; may contract, may acquire and hold such property, real and personal, as

(b) ?That such street or part thereof is unsafe for vehicular traffic and it is in the public interest to 
make such improvement, or 
(c) ?That it is in the public interest to connect two streets, or portions of a street already improved, 
or

embraced in and covered by said assessment or assessments. In the case of such conveyance, it shall 
not be necessary that the street or sidewalk assessment or assessments against the property be 
foreclosed; but the town, upon the receipt of any such conveyance, shall become and be the absolute fee 
simple owner of the property, as fully to all intents and purposes as if purchased in and through

entirely, upon personal services rendered to the town prior to the establishment thereof, and the town 
may contribute the entire cost of benefits based on any such prior service. The contribution required to 
cover the cost of benefits based on prior service, if any, shall be sufficient to fund the liability for such 
prior service in not more than 40 years from the date of establishment of the system. The board of 
commissioners may provide that employees shall share in the cost of financing the system, upon such

following procedures and conditions: 
(a) ?Institution of suit. The Town of Wake Forest may institute a civil action to condemn the land or 
interest in land by filing in the Superior Court of Wake County a complaint and a declaration of 
taking and by depositing with the clerk of the court the sum specified in subsection (b) of this 
section. Upon filing of the complaint and declaration of taking and the deposit of the required 
sum, summons shall be issued and served in the manner provided for service for process in 
civil actions, with a copy of the complaint and declaration of taking and notice of the amount of 
the deposit, upon the person or persons named in the complaint. 
(b) ?Content of complaint and declaration of taking. The complaint and declaration of taking shall 
each include: 
(1) ?A statement of the authority under which, and the public use for which, the property is 
taken. 
(2) ?A description sufficient to identify the entire tract or tracts affected by the taking. 
(3) ?A statement of the estate or interest in land taken for the public use, and a description 
sufficient to identify the area taken. 
(4) ?The names and addresses of those persons who the town is informed and believes may 
have or claim to have an interest in the lands, so far as this information can by reasonable 
diligence be obtained. If any of these persons are infants, non compos mentis, or under 
any other disability, or if their names or whereabouts are unknown, the complaint and 
declaration of taking shall so state. 
    The complaint shall also list any liens or other encumbrances which the town, in the 
exercise of reasonable diligence, is informed and believes exist against the land; and the 
complaint shall include a prayer that there be a determination of just compensation in 
accordance with this section. 
    The declaration of taking shall also state the amount of money which the town estimates to 
be just compensation for the taking. 
    The town may amend the complaint and declaration of taking, and may increase the 
amount of the deposit at any time while the proceedings are pending, and the owner shall have 
the same rights of withdrawal of any additional amount as he had in the original deposit. 
(c) ?Answer; reply. Not later than 30 days after service of summons, complaint, and declaration of 
taking, any person named in the complaint may file an answer. The answer shall contain 
admissions or denials of the allegations of the complaint as are appropriate, the names and 
addresses of the persons filing the answer, together with a statement as to their respective 
interests in the property taken, and any affirmative defenses or matters that are pertinent to the 
action. The answer may: 
(i) ?Pray only for a determination of just compensation, in which case title to the property shall 
vest in the town when all persons named in the complaint have answered, or the 30 days' 
time for answering has expired, or 
(ii) ?Deny the right of the town to take the property for the use or purpose stated in the 
complaint, and pray for a determination of just compensation if the issue of right to take is 
resolved in favor of the town, in which case title to the property shall vest in the town only 
upon judgment entered in the superior court upholding the town's right to take. 
    Affirmative allegations in the answer shall be deemed denied by the town, but the town 
may file a reply within 30 days from receipt of a copy of the answer. 
(d) ?After the filing of the answer, and reply, if any, the judge, upon motion and ten days' notice by 
any party shall, either in or out of term, hear and determine all issues raised by the pleadings, 
other than the issue of just compensation. Only the issue of just compensation shall be 
determined by a jury if either party requests a jury in accordance with the rules of civil 
procedure. (G.S. ch. 1A) 
(3) ?Upon vesting of title to the property in the town, the town shall have right of immediate 
possession, and the court shall proceed to determine the issue of just compensation and to 
disburse the sum deposited by the town, following as nearly as practicable the procedures set 
out in G.S. ch. 136, art. 9, adapted by substituting the Town of Wake Forest in place of the 
department of transportation.

notice prior to the making of any repairs or improvements by the administrator. The amount of the 
cost of such repairs, alterations or improvements shall be a lien against the real property upon which

provided by G.S. 160A-216 et seq. 
(e) ?Preliminary investigation; notice, hearing. 
(1) ?Whenever a petition is filed with the administrator by a public authority or by at least five 
residents of the town charging that any dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit is unfit for human 
habitation, or whenever it appears to the administrator, upon inspection, that any such place is 
unfit for human habitation he or she shall, if his or her preliminary investigation disclosed a basis 
for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in 
such dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit a complaint stating the charges and containing a 
notice that a hearing will be held before the administrator at a place therein fixed, not less than 
ten nor more than 30 days after the serving of such complaint. 
(2) ?It shall be unlawful for the owner or the agent of any owner upon whom such complaint has 
been served to permit any person to occupy any such dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit 
which, at the time of service of such complaint is vacant, or which shall subsequently become 
vacant, until such owner or the agent of such owner shall have obtained from the administrator 
an occupancy permit. The administrator shall issue such occupancy permit upon a 
determination that the dwelling unit complies in all respects with the provisions of this article. 
(3) ?The owner or any party in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to 
appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. 
(4) ?Notice of such hearing shall also be given to at least one of the persons signing a petition 
relating to such dwelling. Any person desiring to do so may attend such hearing and give 
evidence relevant to the matter being heard. 
(5) ?The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings 
before the administrator. 
(f) ?Service of complaints and orders. Complaints or orders issued by the administrator shall be served 
upon persons either personally or by registered mail or certified mail and, in addition thereto, may be 
served by regular mail. When service is made by registered or certified mail and, in addition thereto, 
regular mail and the registered mail or certified mail is unclaimed but the regular mail is not returned 
by the post office within ten days after mailing, service shall be deemed sufficient under this section 
and the general statutes. If the whereabouts of persons is unknown and cannot be ascertained by 
the administrator in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the administrator shall make an affidavit to 
that effect, and then the serving of such complaint or order upon the unknown owner or other 
persons may be made by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the town at least 
once no later than the time at which personal service would be required under the provisions of this 
article. When service is made by publication, a notice of the pending proceeding shall be posted in a 
conspicuous place on the premises thereby affected. 
(g) ?Notice of lis pendens. Any complaint and notice or order issued pursuant to this article may be filed 
in the notice of lis pendens, with a copy of the complaint and notice or order attached thereto, in the 
office of the clerk of superior court of the county. The notice of lis pendens and a copy of the 
complaint and notice or order shall be indexed and cross-indexed in accordance with the indexing 
procedures of G.S. 1-117. From the date and time of indexing, the complaint and notice or order 
shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the owners of and parties in interest in the 
building or dwelling. A copy of the notice of lis pendens shall be served upon the owners and parties 
in interest in the building or dwelling at the time of filing in accordance with G.S. 160A-428 and G.S. 
160A-445. The clerk may cancel the notice of lis pendens upon a showing by the administrator that 
the action in which the complaint and notice or order was issued has been settled, discontinued, or 
abated. 
(h) ?Findings of facts; issuance of order to repair, demolish, etc. If, after such notice and hearing as 
provided for in subsection (e) of this section, the administrator determines that the housing under 
consideration is unfit for human habitation under the terms of this article, he or she shall state in 
writing his or her findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be 
served upon the owner thereof an order: 
(1) ?If the repair, alteration or improvement of such house can be made at a cost not to exceed 50 
percent of the value of the house, requiring the owner, within a time specified in the order by the 
administrator, to repair, alter or improve such house to render it fit for human habitation. In the 
alternative, the administrator may require the owner, within a time specified in the order, to 
vacate and close the house, but only upon determining that continued occupancy during the 
time for repair will present a significant threat or bodily harm, taking into account the nature of 
the necessary repairs, alterations or improvements; the current state of the property and any 
additional risks due to the presence and capacity of minors under the age of 18 or occupants 
with physical or mental disabilities. The order shall state that the failure to make timely repairs 
as directed in the order shall make the dwelling subject to the issuance of an unfit order under 
8-45.9.2. 
(2) ?If the repair, alteration or improvement of such housing cannot be made at a cost not to exceed 
50 percent of the value of the housing, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order 
by the administrator to repair, alter or improve such housing to render it fit for human habitation 
or to demolish and remove such housing. However, notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
if the dwelling is located in a historic district of the town and the Historic District Commission 
determines, after a public hearing, that the dwelling is of particular significance or value toward 
maintaining the character of the district, and the dwelling has not been condemned as unsafe, 
the order may require that the dwelling be vacated and closed consistent with G.S. 160A-
400.14(a). 
(i) ?Failure to comply with order. 
(1) ?If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter or improve or to vacate and close the 
dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit, the administrator may cause such dwelling, dwelling unit 
or rooming unit to be repaired, altered or improved or to be vacated and closed; and the 
administrator may cause to be posted on the main entrance of any dwelling, dwelling unit or 
rooming unit so closed, a placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for human 
habitation; the use or occupation of this building for human habitation is prohibited and 
unlawful." Occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor. 
(2) ?If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the dwelling, the administrator 
may cause such dwelling to be removed or demolished; provided, however, that the duties of 
the administrator as set forth in subsection 8-45(a) and 8-45.(b) shall not be exercised until the 
town board shall have by ordinance ordered the administrator to proceed to effectuate the 
purpose of this section with respect to the particular property which the administrator shall have 
found to be unfit for human habitation and which property shall be described in the ordinance. 
No such ordinance shall be adopted to require demolition of a dwelling until the owner has first 
been given a reasonable opportunity to bring it into conformity with the housing code. Such 
ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds and shall be indexed in the 
name of the property owner in the grantor index. 
(3) ?If the administrator shall have issued an order, ordering a dwelling to be repaired or vacated 
and closed, as provided in subsection 8-45(i)(1) and if the owner has vacated and closed such 
dwelling and kept such dwelling vacated and closed for a period of six months pursuant to the 
order, then if the town board shall find that the owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to 
repair, alter or improve the dwelling in order to render it fit for human habitation and that the 
continuation of the dwelling in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health, 
safety, morals and welfare of the town in that the dwelling would continue to deteriorate, would 
create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants, would attract 
persons intent on criminal activities, would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of 
property values in the area, and would render unavailable property and a dwelling which might 
otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent and affordable 
housing in this state, then in such circumstances the town board may, after the expiration of 
such six-month period, enact an ordinance and serve such ordinance on the owner, setting forth 
the following: 
a. ?If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it fit for human habitation can be 
made at a cost not exceeding 50 percent of the then current value of the dwelling, the 
ordinance shall require that the owner either repair or demolish and remove the dwelling 
within 90 days; or 
b. ?If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it fit for human habitation cannot 
be made at a cost not exceeding 50 percent of the then current value of the dwelling, the 
ordinance shall require the owner to demolish and remove the dwelling within 90 days. 
This ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds . If the owner fails to 
comply with this ordinance, the administrator shall effectuate the purpose of the ordinance. 
(j) ?Appeal. Where compliance with an order of the administrator, or where the literal application of the 
provisions of this article, would appear to cause undue hardship on an owner or other party in 
interest, or when it is claimed that the true intent and meaning of this article or any of the minimum 
standards or requirements herein have been wrongly interpreted, the owner or other party in interest 
may appeal from the order of the administrator to the town board of adjustment. 
(1) ?Notice of appeal shall be in writing and filed in the office of the town clerk within ten days after 
service of the order of the administrator, and shall be on forms provided by the administrator. 
The appeal shall be placed on the agenda for hearing by the town board of adjustment at its 
next regular meeting. 
(2) ?The town board of adjustment upon such appeal, and after a hearing, may extend the time for 
compliance with the administrator's order, or vary the application of any provisions of this article 
in hardship cases when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and 
would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this article or the public interest, or when, in its 
opinion the interpretation of the administrator was wrong and should be modified or reversed. In 
hardship cases, a hardship peculiar to the appellant must be shown. 
(3) ?A decision of the town board of adjustment to extend the time for compliance with an order of 
the administrator, or to vary the application of any provision of this article, or to modify an order 
of the administrator, shall specify in what manner such extension, variation, or modification is 
made, the conditions upon which it is made, and the reasons therefore. 
(4) ?Every such decision of the town board of adjustment shall be in writing, and shall be promptly 
filed in the office of the administrator, and shall be open to public inspection; a certified copy 
shall be sent by mail, or otherwise, to the appellant. 
(5) ?If a decision of the town board of adjustment reverses or modifies a refusal, order or 
disallowance of the administrator, or varies the application of any provision of this article, the 
administrator shall immediately take action in accordance with such decision. 
(6) ?Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent an owner or other party in interest from 
exercising the right of petition for judicial review of an order of the administrator, as provided by 
general law and subsection 8-45(k). 
(k) ?Petition to superior court. Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the administrator or a 
decision rendered by the town board may petition the superior court for an injunction restraining the 
administrator from carrying out the order or decision. The petition shall be filed within 30 days after 
issuance of the order or rendering of the decision. Hearing on the petition shall be as provided in 
G.S. 160A-446(f). 
(l) ?In rem action by administrator; placarding. Barring a petition having been filed under subsection 8-
45.(l) after the failure of an owner of a dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit to comply with an order 
of the administrator issued pursuant to the provisions of this article, and upon adoption by the Town 
Board of an ordinance authorizing and directing him or her to do so, as provided by G.S. 160A-443 
and subsection 8-45(i), the administrator shall proceed to cause such dwelling, dwelling unit or 
rooming unit to be repaired, altered or improved to comply with the minimum standards of fitness 
established by this article, or to be vacated and closed and removed or demolished, as directed by 
the ordinance of the town board, and shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of such 
dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit a placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for 
human habitation; the use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." The occupation 
of a building so posted shall constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor. 
(m) ?Costs of lien on premises. 
(1) ?The amount of the cost of repairs, alterations or improvements, or vacating and closing, or 
removal or demolition by the administrator shall be a lien against the real property upon which 
the cost was incurred, which lien shall be filed, have the same priority, and be collected as 
provided by G.S. 160A-216 et seq. 
(2) ?The amount of the cost of repairs, alterations or improvements, or vacating and closing, or 
removal or demolition by the administrator shall be a lien on any other real property of the 
owner located within the town limits or within 1 mile thereof except for the owner's primary 
residence. The additional lien provided in this subsection is inferior to all prior liens and shall be 
collected as a money judgment. 
(3) ?If the dwelling is removed or demolished by the administrator, he shall sell the materials of the 
dwelling, and any personal property, fixtures or appurtenances found in or attached to the 
dwelling, and shall credit the proceeds of the sale against the cost of the removal or demolition 
and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court by the administrator, shall 
be secured in a manner directed by the court, and shall be disbursed by the court to the 
persons found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of the court. Nothing in this section 
shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the town to define and declare 
nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings, or otherwise. 
(n) ?Notice to affordable housing agencies. Whenever a determination is made pursuant to subsection 
8-45(i) that a dwelling must be vacated and closed, or removed or demolished, under the provisions 
of this article, notice of the order shall be given by first-class mail to any organization involved in 
providing or restoring dwellings for affordable housing that has filed a written request for such 
notices. A minimum period of 45 days from the mailing of such notice shall be given before removal 
or demolition by action of the administrator, to allow the opportunity for any organization to negotiate 
with the owner to make repairs, lease, or purchase the property for the purpose of providing 
affordable housing. The town clerk shall certify the mail of the notices, and the certification shall be 
conclusive in the absence of fraud. Only an organization that has filed a written request for such 
notices may raise the issue of failure to mail such notices, and the sole remedy shall be an order 
required the administrator to wait 45 days before causing removal or demolition. 
(o) ?Alternative remedies. The enforcement of any remedy provided herein shall not prevent the 
enforcement of any other remedies provided herein or in other ordinances or laws. 
(p) ?Conflict with other provisions. In the event any provision, standard or requirement of this section is 
found to be in conflict with any other applicable law, code or ordinance pertaining to housing, the 
provision which establishes the higher standard or more stringent requirement for the promotion and 
protection of the health and safety of the residents of the town shall prevail. 
(q) ?Violations; penalty; fees. 
(1) ?It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit to fail, neglect or 
refuse to repair, alter or improve the same, or to vacate and close and remove or demolish the 
same, upon order of the administrator duly made and served as herein provided, within the time 
specified in such order, and each day that any such failure, neglect or refusal to comply with 
such order continues shall constitute a separate and distinct offense. 
(2) ?It shall be unlawful for the owner or agent of the owner in charge of such dwelling, dwelling unit 
or rooming unit with respect to which an order has been issued pursuant to this article, to 
occupy or permit the occupancy of the same in a dilapidated or deteriorated condition found to 
be unfit for human habitation in violation of such order for its repair, alteration or improvement or 
its vacation, closing or demolition, and each day that such unlawful occupancy continues after 
the expiration of the time prescribed in the order to repair, alter, improve, vacate, close or 
demolish such dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit shall constitute a separate and distinct 
offense. 
(3) ?Any owner of a dwelling or dwelling unit, except an owner who occupies the dwelling as his or 
her principal place of residence, who fails to comply with any of the provisions of this article may 
be subject to a civil penalty in the amount (See Fee Schedule) for the first day of noncompliance 
and (See Fee Schedule) for each day thereafter. This penalty may be recovered by the town in 
a civil action in the nature of debt if the owner does not pay the same within 30 days after the 
initial day of noncompliance. 
(4) ?The town manager may agree, in writing only, to release, in whole or in part, a subsequent 
owner from liability for a civil penalty imposed pursuant to 3 if the civil penalty was imposed 
against the subsequent owner due to a previous owner's failure to bring the property into 
compliance. When this situation exists, a release in whole or part may occur if the subsequent 
owner voluntarily agrees, as consideration for the release, to bring the property into compliance 
within an agreed upon timeframe. However, if the subsequent owner fails to comply with the 
agreement then the civil penalty shall be imposed as if the agreement was never entered into 
and shall be computed from the first day of noncompliance. 
(5) ?The owner of any dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit who fails to repair or vacate and close 
it, or demolish or remove it, upon order of the administrator duly made and served as herein 
provided, within the time specified in such order, shall be subject to an administrative fee set by 
the town board for noncompliance. This fee allows the town to recover some of its 
administrative costs incurred due to the owner's failure to comply with the administrator's order 
described herein. 
(6) ?Any owner of a dwelling or dwelling unit, except an owner who uses the dwelling as his or her 
principal place of residence, who requests a re-inspection after failing an initial inspection may 
be subject to a re-inspection fee when the re-inspection shows that the owner's dwelling still 
fails to comply with the provisions of this article. The re-inspection fee shall not be imposed 
when the owner's dwelling passes the re-inspection. Re-inspection fees shall be (See Fee 
Schedule). 
(7) ?If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling, the administrator may file a 
civil action in the name of the town to remove such occupant. The action to vacate the dwelling 
shall be in the nature of summary ejectment and shall be commenced by filing a complaint 
naming as parties-defendant any person occupying such dwelling. The clerk of superior court 
shall issue a summons requiring the defendant to appear before a magistrate at a certain time, 
date and place not to exceed ten days from the issuance of the summons to answer the 
complaint. The summons and complaint shall be served as provided in G.S. 42-29. The 
summons shall be returned according to its tenor, and if on its return it appears to have been 
duly served, and if at the hearing the administrator produces a certified copy of an ordinance 
adopted by the town board of commissioners pursuant to subsection 8-45(j) authorizing the 
officer to proceed to vacate the occupied dwelling, the magistrate shall enter judgment ordering 
that the premises be vacated and that all persons be removed. The judgment ordering that the 
dwelling be vacated shall be enforced in the same manner as the judgment for summary 
ejectment entered under G.S. 42-30. An appeal from any judgment entered hereunder by the 
magistrate may be taken as provided in G.S. 7A-228, and the execution of such judgment may 
be taken as provided in G.S. 7A-227. An action to remove an occupant of a dwelling who is a 
tenant of the owner may not be in the nature of a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant to 
this subsection unless such occupant was served with notice at least 30 days before the filing of 
the summary ejectment proceeding that the town board of commissioners has ordered the 
administrator to proceed to exercise his or her duties under 8-45(i) to vacate and close or 
remove and demolish the dwelling.

(Ord. No. 2013-26, 9-17-2013) 


Sec. 8-156. - Inspections. 
(a) ?Authority to enter. For the purpose of making inspections and otherwise performing duties under 
this article, the officer may authorize the town's building inspectors to enter, examine and survey at 
all reasonable times all buildings for the purpose of performing the duty of safeguarding the health 
and safety of the general public. 
(b) ?Obtaining a warrant. Whenever an owner, occupant, or agent thereof shall deny the town building 
inspector reasonable access to any premises for purposes of making inspections, the officer or town 
building inspector shall obtain a warrant to inspect as authorized by G.S. 15-27.2. 
(c) ?Emergency cases. In cases where it appears that there is an imminent danger to life or safety of any 
person unless an unsafe building is immediately repaired, vacated, closed or demolished, the code 
enforcement officer shall order its immediate repair, evacuation, closing or demolition as he or she 
may deem necessary, notwithstanding the other provisions of this article. The officer may take the 
temporary measures necessary to safeguard persons from immediate danger of collapse of such 
building and is authorized to close temporarily sidewalks, streets, and other buildings in places 
adjacent to such unsafe building and prohibit the same from being used, pending the elimination of 
the danger. The cost of emergency measures taken shall become a lien against the premises upon 
which the emergency condition existed upon confirmation of the cost by the board of commissioners. 
The confirmation shall take place only after ten days written notice to the owner of the premises 
where the nuisance existed. The board may also notify any other parties of interest of the emergency 
condition. 
(Ord. No. 2013-26, 9-17-2013) 


Sec. 8-157. - Procedure for enforcement. 
(a) ?Preliminary investigation. On the officer's own motion, on request of any public authority, or upon 
receipt of a petition signed by any five residents of the town alleging that any building is unsafe, the 
officer shall authorize the town building inspector to undertake a preliminary investigation of the 
premises. 
(b) ?Notice. If the preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, the officer shall issue and 
cause to be served upon the owner of the building charged as unsafe and all parties in interest in the 
building a complaint stating the charges and containing a notice that an administrative hearing will be 
held before the officer or the officer's designated agent at a place therein fixed, not later than ten 
days after the date of the notice pursuant to subsection 8-157(e). A notice of the pending 
proceedings shall also be posted a conspicuous place on the premises affected at least ten days 
prior to the date of the administrative hearing. Notice of such administrative hearing shall also be 
given to at least one of the persons signing a petition relating to such building, if any. The owner 
shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint in writing with the officer before the time fixed 
on the complaint or to appear in person and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the 
complaint for the administrative hearing. The owner may also give written authorization for any party 
in interest in the building to appear on the owner's behalf at the administrative hearing. 
(c) ?Administrative hearing. The purpose of the administrative hearing is to determine the existence of 
any of those hazardous conditions listed in section 8-155 surveyed in the officer's preliminary 
investigation. Any person desiring to do so may attend such administrative hearing and give 
evidence in the matter being heard. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall 
not be controlling in administrative hearings before the officer. The owner may file with the officer a 
written statement agreeing that the building referred to in the complaint is unsafe, that the same 
should be demolished, and agreeing that all costs of demolition shall be a lien in the nature of a 
special assessment upon the property on which the building is located. In such cases, the officer 
may proceed with the demolition without complying with the additional provisions of this section. 
(d) ?Issuance of order after hearing. If, after such notice and administrative hearing, the officer shall 
determine that the building under consideration is unsafe under the terms of this article, the officer 
shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of that determination and shall issue and cause to 
be served upon the owner thereof an order. If any party in interest other than owner took part in the 
administrative hearing, the order shall also be served on that person. The town at its discretion may 
also serve the order on other parties of interest in the building who did not take part in the 
administrative hearing. The order shall require the owner, within the time specified in the order, but 
not less than 60 days, to repair, alter or improve the building in order to render it safe, or to close 
such building, or to demolish and remove such building. Any unsafe building ordered to be closed or 
to be demolished and removed must immediately be vacated upon notice of the order. The officer 
may require, upon notice of the order, any unsafe building to be repaired, altered, or improved to be 
vacated until such time as the officer determines the building has been made safe. The officer must 
affix a copy of the order on the unsafe building, and also a notice stating: "This building is unsafe." 
For those unsafe buildings which must be or are required to be vacated, notice shall further state: 
"This building is unsafe and unfit for human habitation. Occupation of this building for human 
habitation is prohibited and unlawful." It is the owner's responsibility to insure that the building is 
immediately vacated of all occupants until such time as the officer determines the building has been 
made safe. In its order the town may permit a specified party in interest to carry out the order 
provided that the specified party in interest demonstrates at the hearing its proper legal authority to 
fulfill the order by making the building safe. Such permission granted by the town to a specified party 
in interest shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the owner's duty to fully comply with the order and 
does not relieve the owner of any legal responsibilities. 
(e) ?Methods of service of complaints and orders. 
(1) ?Complaints or orders issued by the officer shall be served upon persons either personally or by 
registered or certified mail. When service is made by registered or certified mail, a copy of the 
complaint or order may also be sent by regular mail. Service shall be deemed sufficient if the 
registered or certified mail is unclaimed or refused so long as the regular mail is not returned by 
the post office within 10 days after the mailing. 
(2) ?If the identities of any owners or the whereabouts of persons are unknown and cannot be 
ascertained by the officer in the exercise of reasonable diligence, or, if the owners are known 
but have refused to accept service by registered or certified mail, and the officer makes an 
affidavit to that effect, then the serving of the complaint or order upon the owners or other 
persons may be made by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the town at 
least once, no later than one week prior to the administrative hearing. Nothing in the section 
limits the town, in its discretion, from providing additional notice by publication in a newspaper 
having general circulation in the Town to persons served personally or by registered or certified 
mail. 
(Ord. No. 2013-26, 9-17-2013) 


Sec. 8-158. - Filing of notice of lis pendens. 
    Lis pendens (a pending suit), in general terms, is a notice filed on public records for the purpose of 
warning all persons that the title to certain property is in litigation, and they are in danger of being bound 
by an adverse judgment. Upon the issuance of a complaint and notice of hearing or order pursuant 
thereto, a notice of lis pendens, with a copy of the complaint and notice of hearing or order attached 
thereto, may be filed by the officer in the office of the clerk of superior court for the county, as provided in 
G.S. 1-120.2. The officer shall serve a copy of the notice of lis pendens upon the owners and parties in 
interest in the building, including any lien holders and tenants who may be determined by the exercise of 
reasonable diligence. The officer may have the notice of lis pendens canceled at such time as the 
building is brought into conformity with this article by sending to the clerk of superior court a notice asking 
that the notice of lis pendens be canceled. 
(Ord. No. 2013-26, 9-17-2013) 


Sec. 8-159. - Failure to comply with order. 
(a) ?Failure to comply. It shall be unlawful for the owner of any building to fail, neglect, or refuse to 
repair, alter, or improve the same, or to fail, neglect or refuse to vacate and close or vacate and 
demolish and remove the same, upon order of the officer duly made and served as herein provided, 
within the time specified in such order. Each day that any such failure, neglect, or refusal to comply 
with such order continues past the time for compliance specified therein shall constitute a separate 
and distinct offense. 
(b) ?No occupancy upon order It shall be unlawful for the owner of any building, with respect to which an 
order has been issued pursuant to section 8-157 of this article, to occupy or permit the occupancy of 
the same after the time prescribed in such order for its vacation. Each day that such occupancy 
continues after such prescribed time shall constitute a separate and distinct offense. It shall also be 
unlawful for any person other than the owner to occupy a building to which an order has been issued 
pursuant to section 8-157 of this article. This shall constitute an offense charged against the 
occupant, separate and distinct from any offense by the owner. Each day that such occupancy by a 
non-owner continues after such prescribed time shall constitute a separate and distinct offense. 
(c) ?Civil offense. Unless specifically provided otherwise, violation of this article shall be a civil offense. If 
an owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter or improve or to vacate and close, or to vacate 
and demolish and remove any unsafe building, any one, all, or combination of the enforcement 
actions authorized by law may be taken, including those set forth herein. 
(1) ?Civil penalty for owner. If the owner of any unsafe building shall fail to comply with an order of 
the officer to repair, alter, or improve or to vacate and close or vacate and demolish and remove 
the same within the time specified therein, or if any building is occupied in violation of this article 
or any valid order or decision of the officer or board of commissioners made pursuant to this 
article, the owner may be subject to a civil penalty (See Fee Schedule) for the first day following 
the expiration of such order or following a determination that an unsafe building has been 
reoccupied in violation of this section, as the case may be. In each instance, a penalty (See Fee 
Schedule) per day may be imposed for each subsequent day that the order remains unsatisfied 
or the unsafe building remains occupied in violation of an order. If an owner fails to pay the civil 
penalty within ten days after being notified of the amount due, the town may recover the civil 
penalty together with all costs by filing one or more civil actions in the general court of justice in 
the nature of a suit to collect a debt. The town attorney is hereby authorized to file suit on behalf 
of the town to collect any civil penalties, and the town manager is hereby authorized to verify 
and sign complaints on behalf of the town in such suits. 
(2) ?Civil penalty for non-owner occupant. In addition to the owner's fines set forth in subsection 8-
159(c)(1) above, if a non-owner occupant of any unsafe building shall fail to comply with an 
order of the officer to vacate the building within the time specified in the order, the occupant 
may be subject to a civil penalty (See Fee Schedule) for the first day following the expiration of 
such order or following a determination that an unsafe building has been reoccupied in violation 
of this section, as the case may be. In each instance, a penalty (See Fee Schedule) per day 
may be imposed for each subsequent day that the unsafe building remains occupied in violation 
of an order. If a non-owner occupant fails to pay the civil penalty within ten days after being 
notified of the amount due, the town may recover the civil penalty together with all costs by filing 
one or more civil actions in the general court of justice in the nature of a suit to collect a debt. 
The town attorney is hereby authorized to file suit on behalf of the town to collect any civil 
penalties, and the town manager is hereby authorized to verify and sign complaints on behalf of 
the town in such suits. 
(d) ?Administrative fees. In addition to any other charge, any owner of a building located within the town 
and its extraterritorial jurisdiction may be subject to an administrative fee (See Fee Schedule) upon 
an inspection hearing disclosing the building to be unsafe. In addition to any other charge, any owner 
of a building located within the town and its extraterritorial jurisdiction may be subject to an 
administrative fee (See Fee Schedule) upon any additional inspection hearing disclosing the building 
to be unsafe within the same 12-month period. The property owner may also be assessed any costs 
incurred in obtaining service including legal publication of notice of complaint charges, hearing notice 
and findings of fact and orders related to the building. 
(e) ?Enforcement of order. If the owner of any unsafe building shall fail to comply with an order of the 
officer to repair, alter, or improve or to vacate and close the same within the time specified therein, or 
if the owner of any unsafe building shall fail to comply with an order of the officer to demolish and 
remove the same within the time specified therein, or if any building is erected, constructed, altered, 
repaired, converted, maintained, or used in violation of this article or any valid order or decision of 
the officer or board of commissioners made pursuant to this article, and court ordered relief has not 
been sought or has not been granted as provided in section 8-160 of this article, the officer may 
institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent the unlawful erection, construction, 
reconstruction, alteration or use of a building in violation of this article or in any way inimical to the 
health and safety of the town's citizens; to correct or abate the violation; to prevent the occupancy of 
the building; or for any other purpose authorized by G.S. 160A-432 and other law. Such action shall 
include repairing, altering, improving, vacating, closing or demolishing and removing the building, as 
required by the order. Before repairing, altering, improving, vacating, closing or demolishing and 
removing the building, the officer must take the following additional steps. 
(1) ?Enforcement action pursuant to ordinance. The officer must submit to the board of 
commissioners for adoption a resolution describing the building and ordering the officer to 
proceed to effectuate the purpose of this article with respect to the particular building which the 
officer found to be unsafe. Such resolution shall be recorded in the office of the register of 
deeds of the county, and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor 
index. The officer must affix a copy of the resolution on the unsafe building, and also a notice 
stating: "This building is unsafe and unfit for human habitation; the use or occupation of this 
building for human habitation is prohibited and unlawful." Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this article, in accordance with G.S. 160A-431, occupation of a building so posted shall 
constitute a class 1 misdemeanor. If, after adoption of such resolution, any occupant fails to 
comply with an order to vacate the building, the officer may file a civil action in the name of the 
Town to remove such occupant without further notice regardless as to whether the occupant is 
also the owner of the building. 
(2) ?Additional resolution one year later. If the officer shall have issued an order ordering a building 
to be repaired or vacated and closed, and such building has remained unrepaired or vacated 
and closed for a period of one year, either by action of the owner as provided in subsection 8-
159(b) above or following the adoption of an resolution by the board of commissioners pursuant 
to section subsection 8-159(e)(1), then, if the board of commissioners shall find that the owner 
has abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter or improve the building in order to render 
it safe, and that the continuation of the building in its vacated and closed status would be 
inimical to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the Town in that the building would continue 
to deteriorate, would create a fire and safety hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants, 
would attract persons intent on criminal activities, would cause or contribute to blight and the 
deterioration of property values in the area, or would render unavailable property and housing 
which might otherwise have been made available to ease the persistent shortage of decent and 
affordable housing, in such circumstances the board of commissioners may, after the expiration 
of such one-year period, enact a resolution and serve such resolution on the owner requiring 
the owner to either repair or demolish and remove the building within 90 days. The town may 
also serve such resolution on any parties of interest. Such resolution shall be recorded in the 
office of the county register of deeds and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in 
the grantor index. If the owner fails to comply with this resolution within the time fixed by such 
resolution, then the officer shall effectuate the purpose of the resolution. The cost of such 
repairs, demolition or removal shall be a lien on the property pursuant to G.S. 160A-432(b) and 
(b1). 
(f) ?Other enforcement action. The failure of the owner to comply with an order issued by the officer may 
also be enforced through any equitable or other remedy deemed appropriate by the town and 
permitted by law. 
(Ord. No. 2013-26, 9-17-2013) 


Sec. 8-160. - Appeals from orders of the officer; review by court. 
(a) ?Appeals to board . All appeals which may be taken from decisions or orders of the officer pursuant 
to this article shall be heard and determined by the board of adjustments. As the appeals body, the 
board shall have the power to fix the times and places of its meetings, to adopt necessary rules of 
procedure and any other rules and regulations which may be necessary for the proper discharge of 
its duties. The board shall keep an accurate journal of all its proceedings. 
(b) ?When appeal may be taken . An appeal may be taken from a final decision or an order of the officer 
by the owner or party in interest, an authorized representative of the town, other than the officer 
issuing the final decision or order, or the board of commissioners of the town upon proper notice. 
Except as provided herein, any appeal shall be taken no later than ten (10) days from the date of 
service of the decision or order as determined by subsection 8-157(e) by filing with the officer and 
with the board of commissioners a written notice of appeal which shall specify with particularity all of 
the grounds upon which the appeal is based. No time limit shall apply to an appeal by an authorized 
representative or the town or the board of commissioners. 
(c) ?Duty of officer. Upon the filing of an appeal upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the officer shall 
forthwith transmit to the board of adjustments all the papers constituting the record upon which the 
final decision or order appealed from was made. The officer shall also report the appeal to the town 
manager, who shall cause the matter to be placed on the agenda for action by the board at its next 
ensuing regular meeting, and shall notify the appellant of the date the board will hear the matter. 
(d) ?Staying of action. When an appeal is from a decision or order of the officer refusing to allow the 
person aggrieved thereby to do any act, the officer's decision or order shall remain in force until 
modified or reversed. When an appeal is from a decision or order of the officer requiring the person 
aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the 
hearing by the board, unless the officer certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal is filed with 
the officer, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished to 
the appellant), a suspension of the officer's requirement would cause imminent peril to life or 
property. In that case, the requirement shall not be suspended except for due cause shown upon not 
less than one day's written notice to the Officer, by the board of commissioners, or by a court of 
record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. 160A-434 and this section. 
(e) ?Hearing of appeals. The board of adjustments shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all 
appeals, and shall reserve the right to continue the hearing of the appeal from time to time. Any party 
may appear in person or by authorized agent or attorney. The board may reverse or affirm, wholly or 
partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make any decision and order as 
in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of the 
officer. The board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there are 
practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this article, 
to adapt the application of this article to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of this 
article shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. A copy of 
the board's decision shall be served on the appellant by the officer. 
(f) ?Petition to superior court. 
(1) ?Every decision of the board of adjustments shall be subject to review by proceedings in the 
nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of the date of service of the decision of the Board, 
but not otherwise. 
(2) ?Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the officer or a decision rendered by the board of 
commissioners may petition the superior court for an injunction restraining the Officer from 
carrying out the order or decision and the court may, upon such petition, issue a temporary 
injunction restraining the officer pending a final disposition of the cause. The petition shall be 
filed within 30 days after issuance of the order or rendering of the decision.

Sec. 8-161. - Costs of lien on premises; disposition of property. 
    Liens. The cost of any repairs, alterations, or improvements, or of vacating and closing, or removal or 
demolition, caused to be made or done by the officer pursuant to this article, shall be a lien against the 
real property upon which such cost was incurred. Such lien shall be filed, having priority, and be collected 
in the same manner as the lien for special assessments established by G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 10 (G.S. 
160A-216 et seq.), and may also include the reasonable cost of attorneys' fees for nuisance abatement 
pursuant to G.S. 9-18. Such lien, if against real property located within the town limits, is also a lien on 
any other real property of the owner located within the town limits or within one mile thereof except for the 
owner's primary residence. This additional lien is junior to all prior liens and shall be collected as a money 
judgment.

Sec. 8-162. - Other remedies. 
    Nothing contained herein or in any other part of this article shall be construed to abrogate or impair 
the power of the town to define and declare nuisances and to cause their abatement by summary action 
or otherwise; to enforce any provision of its charter, or its ordinances or regulations; or to prevent or 
punish violations thereof, and the procedure described herein shall be in addition and supplemental to the 
powers conferred on the town by any other law.

Sec. 8-267. - Board of adjustments to hear appeals. 
    Where compliance with an order of the administrator, or where the literal application of the provisions

(b) ?It shall be unlawful for the owner or agent of the owner in charge of such nonresidential building or 
structure with respect to which an order has been issued pursuant to this article, to occupy or permit 
the occupancy of the same in a dilapidated or deteriorated condition found to be unfit for any use in 
violation of such order for its repair, alteration or improvement or its vacation, closing or demolition, 
and each day that such unlawful occupancy continues after the expiration of the time prescribed in 
the order to repair, alter, improve, vacate, close or demolish such nonresidential building or structure

penalty in the amount (See Fee Schedule) for the first day of noncompliance and a civil penalty (See 
Fee Schedule) for each day thereafter. This penalty may be recovered by the town in a civil action in 
the nature of debt if the person does not pay the same within 30 days after the initial day of 
noncompliance.

demolish or remove it, upon order of the administrator duly made and served as herein provided, 
within the time specified in such order, shall be subject to an administrative fee in an amount set by 
the town board for noncompliance. This fee allows the town to recover some of its administrative 
costs incurred due to the owner's failure to comply with the administrator's order described herein. 
(e) ?A violation may be corrected by any appropriate equitable remedy, a mandatory or prohibitory 
injunction, or an order of abatement as authorized by G.S. 160A-175. The town shall have a lien on 
the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic's and

ARTICLE VI. - WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS[7] 

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 2013-32, adopted Nov. 19, 2013, amended the Code by adding Art. VI, §§ 8-
2458-248. In order to avoid conflicts in section numbering the editor has redesignated these added 
provisions as §§ 8-3018-304. 


Sec. 8-301. - Purpose and intent. 
    Historically, towers and wireless facilities (collectively known as facilities) inherently create the 
potential for fatalities, physical injury and property damage. To protect the public, workers and private 
property owners against the dangers inherent with the presence of towers, other wireless support 
structures and wireless facilities, it is necessary to establish reasonable regulations and measures 
precedent to obtaining a building permit for work associated with a tower or other wireless support 
structure or a wireless facility that is not routine maintenance. Therefore, the following requirements are 
established for applications for non-substantial co-locations and modifications as defined by applicable 
state law. 
(Ord. No. 2013-32, 11-19-2013) 


Sec. 8-302. - Definitions. 
    [The following words and phrases shall have the meanings set forth herein unless the context clearly 
indicates otherwise:] 
    Co-location means attaching a component(s) of a wireless facility to an existing structure. 
    In-kind replacement means replacing a component(s) that is malfunctioning with a properly 
functioning component of the same weight and dimensions and that does not enable an increase in 
revenue for the service provider or increase the compensation paid to the owner or manager of the 
support structure. 
    Modification re a tower or other support structure means anything that: 
(1) ?Changes the loading and stresses placed on the support structure; or 
(2) ?Changes the profile or size of the structure vertically or horizontally; or 
(3) ?Results in changes to the lateral or vertical support of the structure, such as, but not limited to, 
changes in or to support guy wires or their anchors; or 
(4) ?Changes in the means of attachment to the foundation or changes in the size, shape or type 
foundation. 
    Modification re wireless facility means a change in or addition of equipment that: 
(1) ?Results in different dimensions than the existing equipment; 
(2) ?Is of a different color than the existing equipment; 
(3) ?Is expressly intended to enable an increase in revenue for the service provider; 
(4) ?Increases the compensation paid to the owner or manager of the support structure. 
    Need means what is technologically required for the equipment to function as designed by the 
manufacturer and that anything less will result in prohibiting or acting in a manner that prohibits the 
provision of service as intended and described in the narrative of the application. Necessary does not 
mean what may be desired or preferred. 
    Routine maintenance means work necessary to assure that a wireless facility and/or support 
structure exists and operates: 
(1) ?Reliably and in a safe manner; 
(2) ?Presents no threat to persons or property; and 
(3) ?Remains compliant with the latest editions and amendments of all applicable laws, codes, rules 
and regulations, but does not change the number, types or levels of service provided and is not 
done for the purpose of enabling increased revenue for the wireless service provider or the 
owner of the support structure.

Sec. 8-304. - Attachments. 
(a) ?Attachments to buildings: To preserve and protect the nature and character of the area and create 
the least visually intrusive impact reasonably possible under the facts and circumstances, any 
attachment to a building or other structure with a facie [fascia], the antennas shall be mounted on the 
facie [fascia] without increasing the height of the building or other structure, unless it can be proven

prohibiting the provision of service. The provisions of this section shall also apply to any attachment 
to a water tank. 
(c) ?Profile: So as to be the least visually intrusive reasonably possible given the facts and 
circumstances involved, and thereby have the least adverse visual effect, all antennas attached to a 
tower or other structure shall be flush mounted or as near to flush mounted as is possible so as to 
create the smallest profile reasonably possible under the facts and circumstances, unless it can be

    Person shall mean any individual, corporation, partnership, firm, association, trust, estate, public or 
private institution, group, agency, political subdivision of this state, any other state or political subdivision 
or agency thereof or any legal successor, representative, agent or agency of the foregoing. 
    Unnecessary noise shall mean any excessive or unusually loud sound or any sound which disturbs 
the peace and quiet of any neighborhood or which does annoy, disturb, injure or endanger the comfort, 
repose, health, peace or safety of any person or causes damage to property or business. 
    Technical terms: 
(1) ?A-weighted sound level: The sound pressure level in decibels as measured on a sound level 
meter using the A-weighting network. The level so read is designated dB(A). 
(2) ?Decibel (dB): A unit for describing the amplitude of sound, equal to 20 times the logarithm to 
the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to the reference pressure, which 
is 20 micronewtons per square meter. 
(3) ?Sound: An oscillation in pressure, particle displacement, particle velocity or other physical 
parameter, in a medium with internal forces that causes compression, and rarefaction of that 
medium. The description of sound may include any characteristic of such sound, including 
duration, intensity and frequency. 
(4) ?Sound pressure level: 20 times the logarithms to the base 10 of the ratio of the root mean 
squared (RMS) sound pressure to the reference pressure of 20 micronewtons per square 
meter. 
(5) ?Sound-level meter: An instrument which includes a microphone, amplifier, RSM detector, 
integrator or time average, output meter and weighting network used to measure sound 
pressure levels. 
(6) ?Sound level: The weighted sound pressure level obtained by the use of a sound level meter 
and frequency weighting network, such as A, B, or C as specified in American National 
Standards Institute Specifications for sound level meters (ANSI S1.41971 or the latest approved 
version thereof). If the frequency weighting employed is not indicated, the A-weighting shall 
apply. 
(7) ?Sound source: Any person, animal, device, operation, process, activity, or phenomenon which 
emits or causes sound. 
(8) ?Slow response: A measuring technique to obtain an average value when measuring a noise 
level that fluctuates over a range of four dB or more. By way of illustration only, a sound level 
meter set on "slow response" would record a sound level between two and six decibels less 
than the reading for a steadying signal of the same frequency and amplitude when a tone of 
1,000 Hz and for duration of 0.5 seconds is applied. 
(9) ?Amplified sound: Any sound using amplifying equipment, whose source is outside or whose 
source is inside and the sound propagates to the outside or to other dwellings or interior 
locations under separate ownership or occupancy. 
(10) ?Noise: As used herein, unreasonably loud, disturbing sound levels taking into consideration 
the volume, duration, frequency and other characteristics of the sound. 
(Ord. No. 2005-53, 11-15-2005; Ord. No. 2010-03, 3-16-2010) 


Sec. 14-68. - Noise measurement. 
(a) ?For the purpose of determining db(A)'s as referred to in this article, sound levels shall be measured 
on the A-weighting scale on a sound level meter of standard design and quality having 
characteristics established by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or its successor 
body. 
(b) ?Measurement techniques. 
(1) ?Noise measurements shall be made at the property line of the property where the noise to be 
measured is being generated. If measurement on private property is not possible or practical, 
noise measurements may be made at the boundary of the public right-of-way which adjoins the 
complaining property. Such noise measurements shall be made at a height of at least four feet 
above the ground and at a point approximately ten feet away from walls, barriers, obstructions 
(trees, bushes, etc.) on a sound level meter operated on the "A" weighed sound level scale. In 
the case of noises within multi-family or multi-tenanted structures, noise measurements shall be 
made in the complaining unit at a height of at least four feet above the floor and at a point 
approximately equi-distant from all walls on a sound level meter operated on the "A" weighed 
sound level scale. 
(2) ?No individual other than the operators shall be within ten feet of the sound level meter during 
the sample period. 
(3) ?Sound measurements shall be conducted at that time of day or night when the suspect noise 
source is emitting sound. 
(4) ?The sound level measurement shall be determined as follows: 
a. ?Calibrate the sound level meter within one hour before use. 
b. ?Set the sound level meter on the "A" weighed sound level scale at slow response. 
c. ?Set the omnidirectional microphone in an approximately seventy-degree position in a 
location which complies with subsections (b)(1) and (2) above. The operator of the sound 
level meter shall face the noise source and record the meter's instantaneous response 
(reading) observed at consecutive ten-second intervals until 100 readings are obtained. 
d. ?Recalibrate the sound level meter after use. 
(5) ?It shall be unlawful for any person to interfere, through the use of sound or otherwise, with the 
taking of sound level measurements.

(Code 1985, § 19-7; Ord. No. 2007-10, 2-20-2007) 


Sec. 32-8. - Termination of service. 
(a) ?In order to assure discontinuance of service at a time requested by the customer, notice to the town 
in advance of the proposed time of discontinuance shall be required. When a customer desires to 
discontinue service, he shall give notice to the town at least 24 hours in advance and the customer 
will be responsible for all service consumed within the 24 hours following the time of notice of 
discontinuation of service to the city. 
(b) ?The following shall apply to involuntary discontinuance of service: 
(1) ?The town sometimes finds it necessary to discontinue utility service to customers because of 
the following reasons: 
a. ?Failure of a customer to pay any bill for utility service within the time allowed by this 
section; however, the town may continue to accept checks from those who missed 
payment if the customer has previously been in good standing on his/her account; 
b. ?Failure of a customer to make a deposit to guarantee payment or charges for utility service 
or to increase this/her deposit when required by this section or section 32-7; 
c. ?Refusal of legitimate access to premises or damage to or less of property of the town on 
the customer(s premises for which the customer is liable; 
d. ?When a customer has had two or more of his/her checks given in payment of a bill 
dishonored. 
(2) ?When it becomes necessary for the town to discontinue utility service to a customer for any of 
the reasons set forth in subsections (b)(1)a.d. of this section, service will be reinstated only 
after all bills for service then due have been paid, any deposit required has been made and a 
reconnection fee as set by the board of commissioners has been paid for reimbursement of 
expenses involved in disconnecting and reconnecting the utility service. If discontinuance of 
service is made because the customer(s check given in payment of the bill has been 
dishonored, such customer will be required to pay an additional charge for processing the check 
as set by the board. 
(3) ?If a customer is receiving service at more than one location, service any or all locations may be 
discontinued if bills for service at any one or more locations are not paid within the time 
specified by this section; provided, however, that residential utility service shall be not 
discontinued for nonpayment of bills for other classes of service. 
(4) ?It is the policy of the town to discontinue utility service to customers by reason of nonpayment 
of disputed bills only after notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The 
town(s application form for utility service and all bills shall contain clearly visible and easily 
readable provisions stating: 
a. ?The billing month is defined as the month when a bill is rendered for payment. Bills are due 
when rendered for payment. All bills not paid within 22 days from date of bill shall be 
subject to a late payment charge of $5.00 or two percent of the outstanding bill, whichever 
is higher. 
b. ?Any customer disputing the correctness of his/her bill shall have a right to a hearing at 
which time he/she may be represented in person and by counsel, or any other person of 
his choosing, and may present orally or in writing his complaint and contentions to the 
official in charge of utility billing and shall have authority to make a final determination of 
the customer's complaint. 
Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be heard; only questions or proper or correct 
billing will be considered. In the absence of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing 
procedure provided in this section, service will be discontinued at the time specified. When staff 
members turn off electricity for nonpayment, the customer should be notified of the impending 
cutoff as a courtesy.

ARTICLE V. - ELECTRIC SERVICE 


Sec. 32-421. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed 
to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Construction cost means the estimated installed cost of constructing the town's facilities to the point 
of delivery, including the cost of materials, labor, transportation, stores, tax, engineering and general 
expenses. When applied to temporary service and to construction service, the construction cost shall also 
include the removal costs minus the salvage value of the facilities. The customer shall contribute to the 
town, for any construction service facilities in excess of one point of delivery per construction site, an 
amount equal to the installed cost plus removal cost minus salvage value of the company's facilities 
installed solely for the construction service. 
    Construction service means a customer whose needs are normally for less than a 12-month 
continuous period and whose need is for use in the construction of buildings or other establishments 
which will receive, upon completion, permanent electric service from the town. 
    Normal point of delivery means, for overhead service to residential customers, delivery to the outside 
wall of the end of the building nearest to the source of the company's facilities entering the customer's 
premises. For underground electric service to residential customers, the normal point of delivery will be on 
the outside wall of the end of the building or the nearest convenient point on the outside of the front or 
back wall adjacent to the end of the building nearest the source of the town's facilities entering the 
customer's premises. The normal point of delivery for other customers will be at a location designated by 
the town. 
    Residential real estate development means a residential subdivision where permanent electric 
service will be provided to customers. 
    Revenue credit means the amount equal to the number of years in the initial term of the service 
agreement, up to, but not more than, two years, times the estimated annual revenue, minus the estimated 
annual kilowatt-hours multiplied by 2.031 centers per kilowatt-hour. The estimated annual revenue shall 
be determined by the town for the new or additional load and shall be based upon the charges set forth in 
the applicable rate schedule. 
    Temporary service means a customer whose electric service needs are for less than a 12-month 
continuous period and the town's facilities installed to serve the customer will not be needed to serve 
other customers in the near future. 
(Code 1985, § 19-261) 
Cross reference Definitions generally, § 1-2. 


Sec. 32-422. - Extension of service. 
(a) ?Single-phase service to individual customers. 
(1) ?Extensions only involving secondary service. The town will construct, own, operate and 
maintain an overhead service or underground service lateral to the normal point of delivery at its 
expense, except when more than one secondary service pole is necessary, the customer shall 
pay a fee established by the board of commissioners for each additional service pole. For points 
of delivery located beyond the normal point of delivery requiring an investment in excess of that 
needed to serve the normal point of delivery, the customer will pay a fee established by the 
board of commissioners per foot of additional underground or overhead service lateral plus a 
fee established by the board of commissioners for each secondary service pole. When it is 
necessary to relocate the secondary service for the customer's convenience, the customer's 
contribution, if any, will be the construction cost minus the revenue credit. 
(2) ?Extensions involving primary distribution facilities. The town will construct, own, operate and 
maintain all distribution facilities to extend single-phase electric service to the normal point of 
delivery. The town will provide the secondary service portion of the line extension, if any, in 
accordance with subsection (a)(1) of this section. For the primary portion, whether overhead or 
underground, of the single-phase line extension to other than permanently occupied residential 
customers, the customer contribution, if any, will be the construction cost minus the revenue 
credit. For the primary portion, whether overhead or underground, of the single-phase line 
extension to serve a permanently-occupied residential customer, the town will provide, at no 
cost, the least cost overhead or underground service which is compatible with the customer's 
service requirements and the town's engineering standards. If the customer requests other than 
the least cost overhead or underground service to the normal point of delivery, the customer 
contribution, if any, will be the construction cost minus the revenue credit, but not more than the 
difference in the construction cost between the customer's request and the least cost service to 
the normal point of delivery. For points of delivery beyond the normal point of delivery requiring 
an investment in primary facilities in excess of that needed to serve the normal point of delivery, 
the customer will contribute such excess investment. When it is necessary to relocate the 
primary distribution facilities for the customer's convenience, the customer's contribution, if any, 
will be the construction cost minus the revenue credit. 
(b) ?Three-phase service to individual customers. The town will construct, own, operate and maintain all 
overhead and underground distribution facilities necessary to extend three-phase electric service to 
the normal point of delivery. The customer contribution, if any, will be the construction cost minus the 
revenue credit. For points of delivery beyond the normal point of delivery requiring an investment in 
excess of that needed to serve the normal point of delivery, the customer will contribute such excess 
investment. 
(c) ?New residential real estate developments. 
(1) ?The town will construct, own, operate and maintain overhead and/or underground distribution 
facilities to provide a basic distribution system, normally 120/240 volt single-phase service or as 
determined by the town within the real estate development in which it is contemplated that 
individual lots will be sold or leased. The developer requesting the basic distribution system will 
make a contribution, if any, to the town based on the construction cost minus the revenue credit 
from the development. 
(2) ?The company may limit the extent of the installation in a real estate development to that area 
which, in the company's judgment, is likely to be occupied within a reasonable period of time in 
order to avoid excess investment in idle facilities. The developer may obtain installation in the 
additional area by paying a deposit, or, at the town's option, a letter of credit or surety bond in 
lieu of a deposit, equal to the total installed cost of the facilities to serve the additional area. 
Deposits are reviewed annually and are subject to a refund based on the prorata portion of the 
town's idle facilities needed to serve customers during the preceding 12 months. Any deposit 
held by the town for five years will no longer be subject to a refund. Each individual customer 
within a development will be served in accordance with subsection (a) or (b) of this section, 
including any customer contribution. 
(Code 1985, § 19-262) 


Sec. 32-423. - General provisions. 
(a) ?Rights-of-way. The customer will furnish, without cost to the town, necessary easements and rights-
of-way for the supply of electric service. The customer shall be responsible for the initial clearing to 
final grade, free of stumps and other obstructions, for any right-of-way necessary to provide 
underground electric service. In lieu thereof, the town will provide such service, provided the 
customer will contribute to the town the additional clearing costs. 
(b) ?Contributions. The town reserves the right to collect any line extension contributions under this plan 
before installation of the facilities begin. When contributions are required from a party who will also 
be the customer, the contribution may, at the sole option of the town, be included in the first electric 
service bill rendered after such installation. When contributions are required from a residential 
customer, the contribution can be paid in up to six equal installments included as a part of the first six 
electric service bills. If there is a disagreement between the customer and the town regarding the 
revenue credit, the town's calculations will be used; however, the amount of the customer 
contribution in question will be declared a deposit. The revenue credit will be recalculated two years

Sec. 32-432. - Findings of facts. 
    The board of commissioners finds that the discharge of non-stormwater drainage to waters of the 
state and to the municipal storm drainage system could have significant adverse impact upon health, 
safety, and welfare of the community. More specifically: 
(1) ?Illicit stormwater discharges carry pollutants into receiving water bodies, degrading water 
quality and effect in closures of shell fishing water. 
(2) ?A nutrient such as phosphorus or nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters, 
adversely affecting flora and fauna. 
(3) ?Improper connection to the storm drain system and to waters of the state adversely impacts 
quality of receiving waters. 
(4) ?Septic tank discharges from non-compliant systems, washing machine discharges, and illegal 
dumping into the stormwater drains are examples of illicit discharges. 
(5) ?The town must have the authority to deter and/or stop illicit discharges to stormwater drains 
and ditches. 
(6) ?Substantial economic losses result from these adverse impacts on community waters. 
(7) ?Illicit discharges to water bodies diminish their capacity to naturally process runoff nutrients, 
thereby harming flora and fauna. 
(8) ?Increase of illicit discharge to waters can percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing 
groundwater quality. 
(9) ?Improperly managed stormwater systems can decrease the quality of property and human life. 
(10) ?Improperly managed stormwater drainage systems can interfere with the maintenance of 
optimum estuarine areas and biological productivity. 
(11) ?Many future problems can be avoided if land is developed in accordance with an illicit 
stormwater discharge ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2003-45, 11-18-03)

(Ord. No. 2003-45, 11-18-03) 


Sec. 32-438. - Requirements to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best 
management practices. 
    The town will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, 
or property that may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the stormwater drain 
system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment 
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited 
materials or other wastes into the stormwater drain system or watercourses through the use of these 
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise which is, or 
may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, 
additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the 
stormwater drain system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing 
the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity to the extent practicable, shall be deemed 
in compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater management 
plan as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(Ord. No. 2003-45, 11-18-03)

permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the persons and administered under the 
compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and 
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the 
stormwater drain system. 
(b) ?Prohibition of illicit connections. 
(1) ?The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the 
stormwater drain system is prohibited.

the stormwater drain system, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(Ord. No. 2003-45, 11-18-03) 


Sec. 32-441. - Monitoring of discharge. 
(a) ?This section applies to all properties that have stormwater discharges. 
(b) ?Access to properties. 
(1) ?The town shall be permitted to enter and inspect property subject to regulation under this article 
as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has 
security measures in force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry onto 
property, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to 
representatives of the town. 
(2) ?Existing NPDES permit operators shall allow the town ready access to all parts of the premises 
for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept 
under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any 
additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
(3) ?The town has the right to establish on any permitted property such devices as are necessary in 
the opinion of the town to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the stormwater discharge from 
the property. Sampling may include turbidity, coliform, nutrients, suspended solids. Other testing 
devices of existing systems may include video recording, dye testing, etc. 
(4) ?The town has the right to require NPDES permittees discharging stormwater to install 
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be 
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at their 
expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure 
their accuracy. 
(5) ?Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the property to be 
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral 
request of the town and shall not be replaced. The cost of clearing such access shall be born by 
the person. 
(6) ?Unreasonable delays in allowing the town access to a permitted property is a violation of a 
stormwater discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a property with 
an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an 
offense if the person denies the town reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose 
of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article. 
(7) ?If the town has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is 
discharged, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation 
of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspecting and 
sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, 
or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the town may 
seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

Sec. 32-442. - Suspension of stormwater drain access. 
(a) ?Suspension due to illicit discharge in emergency situations. The town may, without prior notice, 
suspend stormwater drain discharge access to a person or business when such suspension is 
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and 
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the stormwater 
drain system or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order 
issued in an emergency, the town may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize 
damage to the stormwater drain system or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to 
persons. 
(b) ?Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. 
(1) ?Any person discharging to the stormwater drain system in violation of the article may have their 
stormwater drain access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit 
discharge. The town will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its stormwater drain 
access. The violator may petition the town for a reconsideration and hearing. 
(2) ?A person commits an offense if the person reinstates stormwater drain access to premises 
terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the town. 
(Ord. No. 2003-45, 11-18-03)

written notice of intent to seek an independent opinion under subsection (d), the town shall have the 
authority to remove or treat such tree(s), or tree part, and charge the cost of removal or treatment on 
the owner's property tax notice. 
(d) ?A property owner may seek an independent opinion, at the owners' cost, from an International 
Society of Arboriculture (ISA) certified arborist who holds the Tree Risk Assessment Qualification 
(TRAQ) designation as to whether the tree(s), or tree part(s) identified by the urban forester require 
removal or treatment. If a property owner intends to seek such an independent opinion, the property 
owner must notify the town in writing of this intent within 30 days of service of the written notification 
requiring removal or treatment set forth in subsection (b). The property owner will have 60 days from

owner will be required to follow the recommendations made by the certified arborist to mitigate the 
risk of damage or injury to property or people within the public right-of-way within 30 days of 
receiving the independent certified arborist's report. Should the property owner fail to mitigate the 
risk within the timeframe allowed herein, the town shall have the authority to remove or treat the tree 
or tree part and charge the cost of removal or treatment on the owner's property tax notice pursuant

or employees, nor to relieve the owner of any private property from the duty to keep any tree, shrub 
or plant upon any street tree area on his property or under his control in such condition as to prevent 
it from constituting a hazard to public health and safety or an impediment to travel or vision upon any 
public property or adjacent right-of-way. The town reserves the right to charge the cost by any 
means allowed by law of any necessary repairs or replacement to public property or adjacent right-
of-way caused by a violation of this section to the property owner.

(Code 1985, § 17-12) 


Sec. 36-62. - Application. 
    Every person desiring to operate a taxicab upon and over the streets of the town shall file on forms 
supplied by the town an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity. 
(Code 1985, § 17-13) 


Sec. 36-63. - Issuance. 
(a) ?The board of commissioners shall order certificates of public convenience and necessity under this 
division issued or refuse to issue such certificates or issue such certificates for a partial exercise of 
the rights granted only by such certificates and under such terms and conditions as in its judgment 
the public convenience and necessity may require. 
(b) ?In determining whether the public convenience and necessity require the franchising of taxicabs, the 
board shall, among other things, take into consideration the following factors: 
(1) ?Whether or not the public convenience and necessity require such proposed or additional 
taxicab service within the town; 
(2) ?The financial responsibility of the applicant and the likelihood of the proposed service being 
permanent, responsible and satisfactory; 
(3) ?The number and condition of equipment. The owner must have telephone communications 
which allow citizens to call and request service and must have car to car communication which 
allow the taxicabs to be dispatched to any person who calls for service. The proposed taxicab 
must be, in the judgment of the taxicab inspector, in good condition, relatively free of interior or 
exterior damage or deterioration, clean and in good operating order and must pass a state 
vehicle inspection; 
(4) ?The schedule of proposed rates to be charged; 
(5) ?The number of taxicabs now operated and the demand for increased service, if any; whether or 
not the safe use of streets by the public, both vehicular and pedestrian, will be preserved; and 
whether or not adequate provision has been made for off-street parking of the taxicabs; 
(6) ?The experience of the applicant in the taxicab business; 
(7) ?Such other relative facts as may be deemed necessary and advisable. 
Before making any decision with respect to the issuance of a certificate, the board or a committee thereof, 
shall make a full and complete investigation of all facts, and may, if it so desires, subpoena witnesses and 
utilize the services of any officer or employee of the town. 
(c) ?Each application for a certificate shall be scheduled for a hearing not later than 20 days after such 
application is filed and the applicant shall be notified by the town by mail to the business address set 
forth in the application of the date and time of such hearing, such notification to be sent at least ten 
days before the date set for the hearing. The town shall also, within the same time, notify all persons 
who at that time hold certificates for the operation of taxicabs within the town, of the date and time of 
such hearing, and the name of the applicant. The town shall cause to be published at least once in a 
newspaper of general circulation or posted in three public places at least ten days before such 
hearing, a notice setting forth the name of the applicant and the date and time of the hearing. The 
cost of such publication shall be paid by the applicant. 
(d) ?The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to establish the existence of public convenience 
and necessity for the operation of the taxicabs specified in his application, and all other facts 
required for the granting of a certificate. 
(Code 1985, § 17-14) 


Sec. 36-64. - Expiration and renewal. 
    A certificate of public convenience and necessity under this division shall constitute a franchise from 
the town for the operation of taxicabs within the town subject to the provisions of this chapter for one year, 
unless a shorter period of time is specified in the certificate. Application for renewal shall be filed annually 
and hearings conducted as provided in this division. 
(Code 1985, § 17-23) 


Sec. 36-65. - Failure to begin operation. 
    If a certificate of public convenience and necessity is granted to an applicant, and the applicant shall 
fail, in accordance with the provisions of the certificate, to begin taxicab operations within 60 days after 
the date of such certificate, the certificate shall become null and void. 
(Code 1985, § 17-24) 


Sec. 36-66. - Transfer. 
    A certificate of public convenience and necessity required by this division is not transferrable without 
the consent of the board of commissioners. Applications for transfer of a certificate shall be filed in the 
same manner as an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity. The proceeding 
upon such application for transfer shall be the same as those described for the issuance of a certificate 
except that the question of public convenience and necessity need not be approved. 
(Code 1985, § 17-25) 


Sec. 36-67. - Substitution of vehicle. 
    The person to whom a certificate of public convenience and necessity has been issued may, by 
appropriate endorsement thereon by the town, substitute another vehicle for a vehicle for which such 
certificate was granted. In such instance, the liability insurance or bonds shall also be transferred to such 
substitute vehicle. 
(Code 1985, § 17-26) 


Sec. 36-68. - Suspension; revocation. 
(a) ?The board of commissioners may at any time after a public hearing suspend and revoke any 
certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by authority of this division for any one or 
more of the following causes: 
(1) ?Failure to operate the taxicabs specified in the certificate in such manner as to serve the public 
adequately and efficiently; 
(2) ?Failure to maintain motor equipment in good repair; 
(3) ?Failure to carry liability insurance or bond as required by this chapter; 
(4) ?Failure to pay to the town taxes or license fees imposed upon such taxicab; 
(5) ?Repeated and persistent violations by the taxicab driver of traffic and safety ordinances or state 
laws relating to alcoholic beverages or prostitution; 
(6) ?Failure to report accidents; 
(7) ?Willful failure to comply with any provision of this chapter or other ordinance or state laws 
relating to the operation of taxicabs. 
(b) ?No certificate of public convenience and necessity shall be revoked until the owner has had at least 
five days' notice by personal service or registered mail of the charges against him, and of the time 
and place of the hearing. If, after the hearing, it is found that the owner is guilty of one or more of the 
offenses listed in subsections (a)(1)(7) of this section, the board shall have the power to suspend 
or revoke the certificate or to condition a revocation upon compliance of its order within any time 
fixed by the board.

2.2 DISTRICT PROVISIONS
2-2 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
2.2 DISTRICT PROVISIONS
2.2.1 URBAN (FORM-BASED) DISTRICTS GENERAL OVERVIEW
A number of the key districts for the Town of Wake Forest are ordered and classified
according to the Rural-Urban Transect. The Transect is a method of classifying the
natural and built environments as a continuum of six conditions, ranging from rural to
urban. The value of the Transect is that it classifies development form with the
appropriate land use and development context. For example, a rural street typically has
no curbs or sidewalks and its buildings are often irregularly spaced. An urban street,
depending on the intensity of urbanism, may have curbs and gutters, regularly placed
street trees, sidewalks, and building forms that are more regular in form and spacing.
Each urban zoning category has detailed provisions for the mix of uses, building type,
density, height, street design, the design of parks and open space, the mix of uses,
building design, parking, streetscape and other aspects of the human environment.
In order to implement the intent of this ordinance, there are hereby created several base
districts with the designations and general purposes listed under each and the specifically
permitted uses, special uses, dimensional standards and permitted building types
included. Each base district has a corresponding Conditional District designation which
shall be administered in accordance with Section 2.6.
Natural & Rural Areas
The Transect begins with two areas that are rural in character: the Natural
Area, which is made up of lands protected in perpetuity as natural,
recreational or agricultural areas; and the Rural Area, which includes areas
of high agricultural, scenic, or environmental value that should be
protected.
Suburban Area
The transition area between countryside and town is called the Suburban
Area. This area consists primarily of single family homes. Although this
area is primarily a residential area, it may have other development types,
such as schools and other civic uses.
General Urban Area
General Urban development is primarily residential, but more urban in
character, having a higher density with a mix of housing types and a
greater mix of uses, including neighborhood-serving commercial uses.
Urban Center Area
At the more urban end of the spectrum is the Urban Center Area. This
can be a small neighborhood center or a larger Village/Town center, the
latter serving more than one neighborhood.
Urban Core Area
The Urban Core or Downtown serves not only adjacent neighborhoods,
but the entire town and the region. While it is typically the central
business district where the greatest mix of uses occurs, the historic
character and location of Wake Forests downtown is too small in size and
scale to serve as a primary urban core area.

2-6 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
2.2.4 RURAL AND SUBURBAN DISTRICTS
In order to maintain existing auto-oriented commercial and industrial areas, and conventionally
developed residential subdivisions, there are hereby continued several base districts with the
designations and general purposes listed under each and the specifically permitted uses, special
uses, and dimensional standards included. It is expected that the expansion or enlargement of
these districts will be minimal as more than sufficient area currently exists in accordance with the
adopted Community Plan for such single-use categories. Each base district has a corresponding
Conditional District designation which shall be administered in accordance with Section 2.6.
BASE DISTRICT DESCRIPTION
A. Open Space District (OS) The Open Space District is established to preserve and protect environmentally
sensitive lands (e.g. floodways, wetlands) and properties that are already under public
ownership and/or otherwise restricted for use for passive or active recreational use.
B. Rural Holding District (RD)
Previous District(s): RD
The Rural Holding District is established as a district in which the principal uses of the
land are restricted due to lack of available utilities, unsuitable soil types or steep
slopes.
C. General Residential (GR3,
GR5, GR10)
Previous District(s): R20, R15, R10,
R5, MF, O-I
R-20 & R-15 convert to GR3
R-10 converts to GR5
R-5, MF & O-I convert to GR10
where applicable
The General Residential Districts are established to maintain previously developed
suburban residential subdivisions for their existing or approved low-to-medium density
single-family dwellings and related recreational, religious and educational facilities.
Intended to act as a transitional zoning district between rural development in the
county and the urban development of the town, these regulations are further intended
to discourage any use which would be detrimental to the predominately residential
nature of the areas included within the district.
D. Neighborhood Business (NB)
Previous District(s): NB, O-I
The Neighborhood Business District is established as a district in which the principle
use of land is for retail trade and services purposes of a lower intensity than the
Highway Business (HB) District. Such districts are generally located near residential
areas and cater to the everyday needs of nearby residential neighborhoods, stressing
accessibility by automobiles, bicycles, and pedestrians.
E. Highway Business (HB)
Previous District(s): HB
The Highway Business District is generally located on the major thoroughfares in town
and provides opportunities for the provision of offices, services and retail goods. The
regulations for this district are intended to accommodate the predominately autooriented
pattern of existing development while encouraging the creation of new
pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use areas that avoid strip commercial development and
establish more resilient land development patterns.
F. Institutional Campus
Development (ICD)
Previous District(s): ICD
This district is intended to allow for the continued and future use, expansion, and new
development of academic and religious campuses and of governmental and health
facilities, where the campus or facility has a total development size greater than 10
acres. The goal is to promote the many varied uses associated with such institutions
while maintaining the overall design integrity of the campus setting and minimizing any
adverse impacts on the neighboring residential and historic areas. In the attempt to
meet this goal numerous requirements are included, such as but not limited to buffers,
landscaping, outdoor lighting, parking, signage, building height, setbacks, and the like.
G. Light Industrial (LI)
Previous District(s): I
The Light Industrial District is established to accommodate externally benign industrial
and office uses that pose little nuisance to adjacent residential or mixed-use areas.
H. Heavy Industrial (HI) The Heavy Industrial District is established to accommodate those industrial,
manufacturing, or large-scale utility operations that are known to pose levels of noise,
vibration, odor, or truck traffic that are considered nuisances to surrounding
development.

2.4 OVERLAY DISTRICTS
2-12 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
2.4 OVERLAY DISTRICTS
For purposes of managing certain environmentally sensitive or visually important geographic areas, certain
overlay districts have been established to impose design, use, or other standards in addition to the
requirements of the underlying base district.
2.4.1 OVERLAY DISTRICT DESCRIPTIONS
OVERLAY DISTRICT DESCRIPTION
A. Local Historic District and Landmarks
Overlay (HL-O)
In order to establish a process in designated historic districts for the
review of development applications and the maintenance of historic
features in the community, the Local Historic District and Landmarks
Overlay District is hereby created.
B. Special Highway Overlay (SH-O) This district is established to protect and to preserve the natural scenic
beauty along major access corridors located in the Town of Wake
Forest's zoning jurisdiction; and, to protect the carrying capacity of
these major thoroughfares by reducing the hazards arising from
unnecessary points of ingress and egress and cluttered roadside
development; and, to reduce the costs of future highway expansions by
protecting the associated highway corridors at the time of development.
This will be achieved by requiring buildings and structures to be
sufficiently set back from future rights-of-way to provide adequate
storage for vehicles until they can safely enter the highway as well as
additional lanes, if necessary. It is the intent of this district to ensure
that development occurring in the special highway overlay district shall
be in harmony with and shall preserve the natural beauty and character
of the existing landscape as well as be consistent with the adopted
corridor plans for US 1 and the NC-98/Dr. Calvin Jones Highway
Bypass accordingly.
C. Required Shopfront (SF)
In order to implement vibrant, pedestrian-friendly areas in Form-based
Districts, the Required Shopfront Overlay District has been created to
ensure that the ground floor of buildings in designated blocks are
designed using either Shopfront & Awning, Gallery, or Arcade private
frontage.
D. Falls Lake Watershed Protection Overlay
(FL-CA & FL-WMA)
Previous District(s): R-40W
The Falls Lake Watershed Protection regulations are established as an
overlay district to preserve water quality in the Falls Lake water supply
watershed in order to provide safe drinking water. The intent of this
district is to establish regulations which ensure the availability of public
water supplies at an acceptable level of water quality for present and
future residents. Two districts are hereby created: The Falls Lake-
Critical Area (FL-CA) and the Falls Lake-Watershed Management Area
(FL-WMA).
E. Richland Creek Watershed Protection
Overlay (RC-CA & RC-WMA)
The Richland Creek Watershed Protection regulations are established
as an overlay district to preserve water quality in the Richland Creek
water supply watershed in order to provide safe drinking water. The
intent of this district is to establish regulations which ensure the
availability of public water supplies at an acceptable level of water
quality for present and future residents. Two districts are hereby
created: The Richland Creek-Critical Area (FL-CA) and the Richland
Creek -Watershed Management Area (FL-WMA).
F. Smith Creek Watershed Protection Overlay
(SC-CA)
Previous District(s): R-80W
The Smith Creek Watershed Protection regulations are established as
an overlay district to preserve water quality in the Smith Creek/Wake
Forest Reservoir water supply watershed in order to provide safe
drinking water. The intent of this district is to establish regulations which
ensure the availability of public water supplies at an acceptable level of
water quality for present and future residents.

UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 2-13
2.4.2 HISTORIC DISTRICT AND LANDMARKS OVERLAY (HL-O) DISTRICT
A. Purpose: The Historic District and Landmarks Overlay District (HL-O) is a zoning
overlay district established pursuant to NCGS §160A-400 and created with the
purpose of implementing additional protections and controls on properties and
structures located within locally designated Historic Districts as well as to individual
Historic Landmarks.
B. Applicability: All locally designated Historic Districts and Historic Landmarks
shall be a part of the Historic District and Landmarks Overlay District.
C. Procedures:
? Designation of Historic Landmarks/Districts  15.11.1
? Certificates of Appropriateness-Minor  15.11.2
? Certificates of Appropriateness-Major  15.11.3
D. Certificate of Appropriateness
1. COA Required: No exterior feature of any building or other structure in an
HL-O (including masonry walls, fences, light fixtures, utility structures, steps,
pavement, signs, landscape and color or other appurtenant features), shall be
erected, altered, restored, moved or demolished until after an application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the
Historic Preservation Commission. A Certificate of Appropriateness is required
to be issued by the Commission prior to the issuance of a building permit or
other permit granted for the purposes of constructing, altering, moving or
demolishing structures. Any building permit or such other permit not issued in
conformity with this section shall be invalid. A Certificate of Appropriateness
shall be required whether or not a building or other permit is required. The
Town of Wake Forest and other public entities shall be required to obtain a
Certificate of Appropriateness prior to any changes in the character of public
facilities, utilities, or public buildings.
2. COA Conditions of Approval: In approving a Certificate of Appropriateness,
the Commission may attach reasonable conditions necessary to carry out the
purposes of this ordinance.
3. Exterior Features: For purposes of this ordinance, "exterior features" shall
include the architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of the
exterior of a building or other structure, including the kind and texture of the
building material, the size and scale of the building or other structure, and the
type and style of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs, and other appurtenant
fixtures, as well as historic signs, significant landscape, archaeological and
natural features of the area, and shall apply to all sides of any such structures
that can be seen from any adjacent street (excluding rear lanes or alleys) or
public park. In the case of outdoor advertising signs, exterior features" shall
mean the style, material, size, and location of all such signs.
4. Limitation on Review of Interior Features: Notwithstanding this ordinance,
jurisdiction of the Commission over interior spaces shall be limited to specific
interior features of architectural, artistic, or historical significant in publicly
owned landmarks, and of privately owned historic landmarks for which
consent for interior review has been given by the owner. If an owner's consent
for interior review has been filed in the office of the Wake County Register of
Deeds and indexed according to the name of the owner of the property in the
grantee and grantor indexes, such consent shall bind future owners and/or

successors in title. The ordinance establishing the historic designation shall
specify the interior features to be reviewed and the specific nature of the
Commission's jurisdiction over those features.
5. Normal Maintenance and Repair/Certain Changes Not Prohibited:
Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature of a historic
landmark or property located within a district that does not involve a change in
design, material, or outer appearance thereof. Nor shall this ordinance be
construed to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration,
moving, or demolition of any such feature when a building inspector or similar
official certifies to the Commission that such action is required for the public
safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prevent a property owner from making any use of their property
not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances, or regulations. Nothing in this
ordinance shall be construed to prevent the maintenance of or, in the event of
an emergency, immediate restoration of any existing above-ground utility
structure without approval by the Commission.
6. Use of Design Guidelines: The Commission shall adopt, utilize, and amend,
as needed, guidelines, not inconsistent with Part 3B Article 19 of Chapter 160A
of the N. C. General Statutes and the US Secretary of the Interiors Standards
for Rehabilitation for altering, restoring, moving, or demolition of property
designated as historic. It is the intention of these guidelines to ensure, insofar as
possible, that changes in designated landmarks or properties located within
designated districts shall be in harmony with the reasons for designation.
7. Administrative Approval for Minor Works Allowed: The Commission staff
may issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for minor works as listed in the
Commission's Design Guidelines or as otherwise directed by the Commission.
Minor works shall include and are defined as those exterior changes that do not
involve substantial alterations, additions, or removals that could impair the
integrity of the property and/or district as a whole. No application for a minor
works Certificate of Appropriateness may be denied without formal action by
the Commission.
8. Delay in Demolition of Designated Properties: Any application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness authorizing the relocation, demolition, or
destruction of a building or structure within a HL-O may not be denied.
However, the effective date of such a Certificate of Appropriateness may be
delayed for a period of up to 365 days from the date of approval of the
Certificate of Appropriateness. The Commission may reduce the period of
delay where it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be
permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from such property by
virtue of the delay. During such period the Historic Preservation Commission
may negotiate with the property owner and any other parties in an effort to
find a means of preserving the building, structure or site.
9. Properties of Statewide Significance: The Commission may deny an
application for a Certificate of Appropriateness authorizing the demolition or
destruction of a building, site, or structure determined by the State Historic
Preservation Office to have statewide significance, as defined in the criteria of
the National Register of Historic Places, unless the Commission finds that the
owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all
beneficial use or return by virtue of the denial.

UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 2-15
E. Demolition by Neglect: Demolition by neglect of any designated historic
landmark or property located within a district shall constitute a violation of this
ordinance. For the purposes of this ordinance demolition by neglect shall
generally mean the failure to properly maintain a structure, whether intentionally or
not, such that it falls into such disrepair that it may become uninhabitable. The local
governing body may take appropriate actions to prevent demolition by neglect, as
outlined in Section 16.2.8, provided such actions include appropriate safeguards to
protect the property owner from undue economic hardship.
F. Permitted Uses: All uses permitted in the applicable land development district
underlying a historic overlay district are permitted in the HL-O.
2.4.3 SPECIAL HIGHWAY OVERLAY (SH1-O AND SH2-O)
A. Applicability: The Special Highway Overlay Districts (SH-O) shall apply to all
properties located on either side of a major access corridor (as noted below)
beginning at the centerline of the existing right-of-way. The depth of the district is
1,000 feet and shall follow identifiable boundaries whenever possible measured on
either side of the right-of-way of the major access corridor. All such locations shall
be noted on the official zoning map.
? Highway US-1 (SH1-O)
? Dr. Calvin Jones Highway (SH2-O)
B. Exceptions: Exceptions to the district depth, location, landscaping and buffering
can be applied in the following instances:
? Where identifiable conditions exist to screen the visibility of motorists, or
? At an intersection targeted for shopping center development.
? A PUD district may propose acceptable alternative standards within an SH-O
district, as it speaks to minimum yard dimensions and supplemental planting
standards so long as they are in keeping with the overall intent of this
ordinance.
C. Landscaping and Buffering: It is the intent of this section that the frontage along
the designated thoroughfares to the extent practical be left in an undisturbed or
enhanced state of vegetation, and that sufficient areas of natural buffer remain so
that the proposed use will be visually in harmony with the natural wooded character
of the area. Removing or denuding of natural forest vegetation along major access
corridors is strongly discouraged; however, it is understood that conditions may
exist as stated in Section 2.4.3.F-G, which may warrant removing of natural forest
vegetation. (Exemption: Existing lots of record that are developed for single-family
detached or duplex dwelling units)

9.8 of this ordinance.
4. For projects with an associated Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA), the maximum
number of driveways shall be determined though TIA requirements as well as
Town and NCDOT approvals.
F. Modification of Standards (Minor): The administrator, in reviewing a
development application, may adjust specific SH-O yards and setback requirements
for yards adjacent to the major access corridor or intersecting streets provided the
average depth of a required yard or setback for the entire parcel is maintained. In
permitting site-specific variations the Administrator shall find that the requested
modification:
1. Is consistent with the overall purpose and intent of these requirements;
2. Is necessitated by the configuration and/or topography of the land, which
makes it impractical to comply with the yard and setback requirements of this
section for specific areas of the parcel;
3. Does not reduce the required yard or setback by more than 50%.
G. Modification of Standards (Major): The Board of Commissioners, in reviewing a
development application, may adjust (either reduce or increase) minimum SH-O
yards and setback requirements for yards adjacent to the major access corridor or
intersecting streets upon making a finding that the proposed adjustment of those
requirements:
1. Is consistent with the overall purpose and intent of these requirements;
2. Is necessitated by the configuration and/or topography of the land, which
makes it impractical to comply with the yard and setback requirements of this
section;
3. Is no greater than is necessary to allow for reasonable development of the tract;
4. Will not adversely affect the value of adjoining or abutting property, or that the
use is a public necessity; and

5. Is necessitated to preserve existing natural vegetation considered to be a
landmark or in an advanced stage of growth, removal of which would visually
affect the natural wooded character of the area.
H. Expansions and Changes of Use: For properties which have expansions or
additions which singularly or collectively exceed 25% of the gross floor area
and/floor surface area, or change use which requires additional off-street parking
made after application of this section, the SH-O yard requirements are as follows:
1. Where adjacent to a major access corridor, provide SH-O yard of 25 feet of
natural vegetation or planted equivalent. Screening shall be provided at a rate of
3 trees per 50 linear feet of SH-O yard.
2. Where adjacent to a street intersecting a major access corridor, provide a SH-O
yard of 15 feet of natural vegetation or planted equivalent. Screening shall be
provided at a rate of 2 trees per 50 linear feet of SH-O yard.
2.4.4 REQUIRED SHOPFRONT (SF)
A. Intent: While retail/restaurant uses are not required uses, the intent of the Required
Shopfront Overlay is to provide a building frontage that would not preclude those
uses at some point in the future through the depth of the first and second layer.
B. Permitted Frontages: If a block face is designated on the Zoning Map as
Required Shopfront, then all new development along that designated street
frontage must provide one of the following Private Frontages (per Section 5.3) at
sidewalk level along the entire length of the frontage:
1. Shopfront & Awning,
2. Gallery, or
3. Arcade.

D. RC-WMA (Richland Creek Watershed Management Area) District; and
E. SC-CA (Smith Creek Critical Area) District.
2.5 FLOATING OVERLAY DISTRICTS
The floating overlay districts are included as tools for development regulation that will encourage
integrated mixed-use development as the town continues to grow and expand. The intent of the floating
overlay districts is to allow more flexibility for these types of development in certain instances without
requiring a standard legislative rezoning process. Instead, administrative (by-right) and/or quasi-judicial
processes are established to allow development to proceed under the regulations outlined for each floating
overlay district. When a floating overlay district is applied, the requirements for the floating overlay
district shall supersede any conflicting requirements of the base district. All requirements of the base
district that do no conflict with the standards of the floating overlay district shall apply.
2.5.1 TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT (TND)
A. Purpose and Intent: The Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) is a
floating overlay district option established to allow for the development of fully
2
DISTRICT PROVISIONS
2.5 FLOATING OVERLAY DISTRICTS
2-18 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
integrated, mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods in order to minimize
traffic congestion, suburban sprawl, infrastructure costs and environmental
degradation. This district is a planned development district in that it is created
through the combination of other form-based districts as sub-districts under the
umbrella of the TND.
B. Process and Applicability:
1. The TND Floating Overlay District designation shall automatically apply byright
to all development sites of 100 acres or greater. The approval of TND

transect zone (as outlined in 2.2.7.D below) shall be made a part of this
application and approval.
2. Development sites of less than 100 acres may be developed under a TND
Floating Overlay District subject to the Conditional District rezoning process
established in Section 15.15. A TND Master Plan, indicating land allocations
by transect zone (as outlined in 2.2.7.D below), proposed subdivisions of
property, and other information required by Section 15.15 shall be made a
part of the Conditional District Master Plan application and approval.
C. Findings of Fact for TND Master Plan Approval: In granting approval of a
TND Master Plan, the approving authority shall make the following findings of
fact, in addition to other findings of fact required elsewhere in this ordinance:
1. The plan is in compliance with the specifications of this ordinance.
2. The plan conforms to the adopted plans (as applicable) for the physical
development of the town.
3. The impacts to adjacent property of higher-intensity, non-residential uses are
adequately mitigated.
4. The impacts of traffic generated by the TND on the existing road network are
mitigated.

UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 2-19
E. Land Allocation by Transect Zone: When composing the TND Master Plan, the
form-based districts in Section 2.2.1 shall be used as sub-districts and so designated
on the zoning map within the ranges noted below (ranges are noted in % of gross
land area).
1. UR: 30-80%
2. RMX: 10-30%
3. NMX: 10-30%
4. Civic Structures: A minimum of 2% of the land area shall be reserved for the
construction of civic structures (schools, community buildings, religious
institutions, etc.) and their support facilities (parking areas, etc.). Such sites shall
be in prominent locations that are centralized to the neighborhood, accessible
to the greater community, and help to visually anchor important vistas. The
required reservation does not include recreational open space such as parks,
playgrounds, greenways, or conserved lands.
F. Specific Development Standards
1. Neighborhood Design: The entire land area of the TND shall be divided into
blocks, streets, lots and open space areas.
2. Land Use Relationships: Similar land use categories shall generally front
across streets. Dissimilar categories shall abut at rear lot lines. Corner lots
which front on streets of dissimilar use shall be set back the same as the
adjacent use with the lesser setback.
3. Open Space: No portion of the TND shall be further than ¼ mile from a
publicly accessible (public or privately maintained with a public access
easement) recreational open space as defined in Chapter 7, including
recreational open space outside of the TND boundaries. Recreational Open
Space shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 7.
4. Dimensional Standards and Building Types: The Dimensional Standards
and Building Types shall be established in accordance with the neighborhood
design, but within 200 feet of all property boundaries (not across streets) the lot
widths and depths and building types shall be generally consistent with adjacent
zoning district(s) of a lower development intensity/density.
2.6 CONDITIONAL DISTRICTS (CD)
Conditional Districts are districts with conditions voluntarily added by the applicant and approved in a
legislative procedure by the Board of Commissioners in accordance with G.S. 160A-382. Conditional
Districts provide for orderly and flexible development under the general policies of this ordinance without
the constraints of some of the prescribed standards guiding by-right development. Because Conditional
District developments are constructed in a comprehensive manner, they establish their own building,
street, block, and lot pattern which may be unique from other surrounding blocks or neighborhoods. This
Conditional District may be used in any district but is not intended to relieve hardships that would
otherwise be handled using a variance procedure.
2.6.1 STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL DISTRICTS
Within a Conditional District (CD), petitioners may place additional requirements or
standards onto themselves and their property or ask that certain uses identified in the
specific zoning category or provisions in Chapters 2-12 be decreased. It shall be the
Board of Commissioners final decision to grant approval or denial of the CD zoning
amendment in light of the revised development standards presented in accordance with

2.7 Planned Unit Development (PUD)
The Planned Unit Development (PUD) district is designed to: promote a compatible mix of uses to
instigate an integrated and sustainable development consistent with the Town's unique character. This
district shall also encourage design flexibility; multi-modal connectivity between uses; sensitivity to
natural resources and environmental features; and facilitate the efficient provisions of infrastructure,
utilities and adequate public facilities.
The PUD district is not intended for use with subdivisions or developments which can be developed
under the strict application of the minimum standards of the UDO, thereby resulting in a unique, high
quality overall development. The specific procedures for review and approval of a PUD is found in
section 15.16, Planned Unit Development. Above all, every PUD established, shall demonstrate
consistency with the goals and policies established in the Wake Forest Community Plan.
A. General Applicability: Before any development shall be designated as a Planned Unit
Development district on the Official Zoning Map, it shall receive approval pursuant to the terms of
this Section and Sec. 15.16 Planned Unit Development
B. Permitted Uses, Development Standards and Minimum Requirements: In return for greater
flexibility in site design, PUD Districts are expected to deliver exceptional quality community
designs that preserve critical environmental resources; provide high quality community amenities;
incorporate creative design in the layout of buildings and circulation; ensure compatibility with
surrounding land uses and neighborhood character; provide high quality architecture; and provide

to address issues that will help to expedite the review and permitting process
and certain issues or concerns the town may have. A pre-application meeting
shall also include a site visit, if there has not been a prior site visit for the
requested facility.
2. Retention of Expert Assistance Cost to be Borne by Applicant: The town
may hire any consultant and/or expert necessary to assist the town in reviewing
and evaluating the application, including the construction and modification of
the site, once permitted, and any site inspections. Preference shall be given to
those persons or organizations who i) have at least five (5) years experience
working exclusively for the public sector regulating Towers and Wireless
SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS
3.11 SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS  INFRASTRUCTURE 3
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 3-15
Facilities or negotiating leases for such facilities; ii) Wake Forest residents; and
iii) firms who qualify as Minority and Women-owned Firms under applicable
State and Federal guidelines. The cost of such shall be the responsibility of the
applicant in accordance with the towns adopted fee schedule. The payment of
the expert assistance cost and the application fee to the town shall precede the
pre-application meeting or any work being done as regards processing an
application. The town will maintain an accounting for the hours expended in
the review of the application. The towns consultant/expert shall invoice the
town for all time expended in its services.
3. Carrier Required for Application: Neither a Special Use Permit, Conditional
District, nor a Development Permit shall be issued for construction of a new
Tower or other support structure or for a Substantial Modification of such
until there is a specific carrier with a written commitment to use the Facility if
permitted that i) documents the technical need for the height requested to
primarily and essentially serve the town; and ii) shows by clear and convincing
evidence that co-location on an existing structure within the applicant's search
ring without resulting in a new structure or Substantial modification is not
reasonably feasible. Co-location on an existing structure is not reasonably
feasible if co-location is technically or commercially impracticable or the owner
of the support structure is unwilling to enter into a contract for such use at fair
market value.
4. Revocation: Special Use Permits for Wireless Telecommunications Facilities
shall automatically be revoked if the physical construction of activity authorized
by said permit has not commenced within 120 days of the date of issuance of
the applicable permit. Failure to complete construction of a WTF within 90
days subsequent to issuance of a Development Permit shall result in revocation
of the Development Permit unless prohibited from completion of such
construction by an act of force majeure.
5. Responsible Party(s): The owner(s) of a Facility or Complex, any support
structure used to accommodate wireless Facilities, and of the land upon which
a Facility support structure or Complex is located, shall at all times be jointly
and severally responsible for: (1) the physical and safe condition of the Facility
or Complex, support structure and all components on the site related to the
Facility or Complex; (2) assuring that all activities of owners, users, or lessees
occurring on the site, and all components on the site related to the Facility or
Complex, are at all times in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances,
rules, regulations, orders, and permits related to the Facility or Complex; and
(3) assuring the proper permitting as required by this Article and other Town
regulations by all lessees and users of the Facility or Complex, including but not
limited to any upgrades and/or Modifications of equipment. Said owner(s) shall
regularly and diligently monitor activities at the site to assure that the Facility or
Complex is operated in compliance with this Ordinance, other Town
regulations, and any Special Use Permit or Conditional District.
D. General Policies and Procedures for Applications under this Section
In order to ensure that the placement, construction and Modification of a Facility
or the components of a Complex do not endanger or jeopardize the Towns health,
safety, public welfare, environmental features, the nature and character of the
community and neighborhood and other aspects of the quality of life specifically
listed elsewhere in this Section, the Town hereby adopts an overall policy and
related procedures with respect to the submittal, review, approval and issuance of

and circumstances involved;
9. Requiring that the Facility and Complex shall be the least visually intrusive
among those options available in the Town given the facts and circumstances.
10. The Board of Commissioners are the officially designated agency or body of
the Town to whom applications for a Special Use Permit for a Facility or
Complex must be made, and that is authorized to make decisions with respect
to granting or not granting or revoking Special Use Permits applied for under
this Section. The Board of Commissioners may at its discretion delegate or
designate the Planning Board or other official agencies or officials of the Town
or outside consultants to accept, review, analyze, evaluate and make
recommendations to the Board of Commissioners with respect to the granting
or not granting or revoking Special Use Permits for Wireless
Telecommunications Facilities. However, the Board of Commissioners shall
possess the sole right to grant all Special Use Permits.

SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS
3.11 SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS  INFRASTRUCTURE
3-18 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
or Complex not in full compliance with this Section shall be required to be
brought into full compliance before any Permit of any kind will be issued.
22. An Application shall be signed on behalf of the Applicant(s) by a person vested
with the authority to bind and commit the Applicant attesting to the
truthfulness, completeness and accuracy of the information presented.
23. The Applicant must provide documentation to substantiate that it has the right
to proceed as proposed on the site or at the Complex in the form of an
executed copy of the lease with the landowner or landlord or a signed letter of
agency granting authorization. If the applicant owns the site or Complex, a
copy of the ownership record is required.
24. Applications shall include written commitment statements to the effect that:
a. the applicants Facility or Complex shall at all times and without exception be
maintained in a safe manner, and in compliance with all conditions of all
permits, as well as all applicable and permissible local codes, ordinances, and
regulations and all applicable Town, State and Federal Laws, rules, and
regulations, unless specifically granted relief by the Commission in writing;
b. the construction of the Facility or Complex is legally permissible,
including, but not limited to the fact that the Applicant is licensed to do
business in the State.
25. Where a certification is called for in this Section, such certification shall bear
the signature and seal of a Professional Engineer licensed in the State.
26. A support structure and any and all accessory or associated structures shall
maximize the use of building materials, colors and textures designed to blend

surroundings. This shall include the utilization of stealth or camouflage or
concealment technology as may be required by the Town.
27. All utilities at a Complex or site shall be installed underground and in
compliance with all Laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of the Town,
including specifically, but not limited to applicable electrical codes.
28. At a Facility or Complex needing vehicular access, an access road, parking and
turn around space for emergency vehicles shall be provided to assure adequate
emergency and service access. Maximum use of existing roads, whether public
or private, shall be made to the extent practicable. Road construction shall at all
times minimize ground disturbance and the cutting of vegetation. Road grades
shall closely follow natural contours to assure minimal visual disturbance and
reduce soil erosion. If the current access road or turn around space is deemed
in disrepair or in need of remedial work to make it serviceable and safe and in
compliance with any applicable regulations as determined at a site visit, the
Application shall contain a commitment to remedy or restore the road or turn
around space so that it is serviceable and safe and in compliance with
applicable regulations.
29. All work at a Facility or Complex shall be done in strict compliance with all
current applicable technical, safety and safety-related codes adopted by the

SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS
3.11 SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS  INFRASTRUCTURE 3
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 3-19
edition of the TIA ANSI Code, National Electric Safety Code, the National
Electrical Code and the Occupational and Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) regulations, recommended practices of the National Association of
Tower Erectors and accepted and responsible workmanlike industry practices.
The codes referred to are codes that include, but are not limited to,
construction, building, electrical, fire, safety, health, and land use codes. In the
event of a conflict between or among any of the preceding the more stringent
shall apply.
30. A holder of a Special Use Permit or Administratively granted permit under this
Section shall obtain, at its own expense, all permits and licenses required by
applicable law, ordinance, rule, regulation or code, and must maintain the same,
in full force and effect, for as long as required by the Town or other
governmental entity or agency having jurisdiction over the applicant.
31. Unless such is proven to be technologically impracticable, the Town requires
the co-location of new antenna arrays on existing structures, as opposed to the
construction of a new Complex or support structure or increasing the height,
footprint or profile of a Facility or Complex beyond the conditions of the
approved Special Use Permit for an existing Facility or Complex. In instances
not qualifying for the Streamlined process the Applicant shall submit a
comprehensive report inventorying all existing structures more than fifty feet
(50) in height within one-half (1/2) mile of the location of any proposed new
Facility or Complex.
32. An Applicant intending to co-locate on or at an existing Facility or Complex
shall be required to document the intent of the existing owner to permit its use
by the Applicant.
33. Co-located equipment shall consist only of the minimum Antenna array
technologically needed to provide service primarily and essentially within the
Town, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown in the form of
clear and convincing evidence.
34. DAS systems that are owned or operated by a commercial carrier and are part
of a commercial wireless system, or are used for commercial purposes, are
expressly included in the context of this Section, regardless of the location or
whether the Facility or any of its components is located inside or outside a
structure or building.
35. The existence of a lease or an option to lease shall not be deemed justification
for not complying with the priorities set forth in this Section. An Applicant
may not by-pass sites of higher priority solely because the site proposed is
under lease or an option to lease exists. If a site other than the number one
priority is proposed, the applicant must explain to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Town why co-location is technically or commercially impracticable. Buildto-
Suit agreements between carriers and a proposed Tower owner shall not be
a valid basis for any claim of exemption, exception or waiver from compliance
with this Section.
36. New Towers or other support structures shall be prohibited in Residential
Districts, Historic Districts, Renaissance Districts and areas officially deemed to
be visual or scenic sensitive areas, unless the Applicant provides clear and
convincing technical evidence demonstrating that i) a new Tower as proposed
3
SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS
3.11 SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS  INFRASTRUCTURE
3-20 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
is Necessary, ii) that the intended area cannot be served from outside the
District or sensitive area; iii) that no existing or previously approved Facility or
Complex can reasonably be used to serve the intended area within the Town;
and iv) that not to permit a new Tower would result in or would preclude
eliminating a significant gap in service.
37. Required Signs
a. Notification shall be posted on all sides of a Facility to warn all persons in
the immediate area of the presence of RF radiation or to control exposure
to RF radiation within a given area.
b. Name(s) of the owner(s) and operator(s) of the antenna(s) as well as
emergency phone number(s). The sign shall be on the equipment shelter or
cabinet of the applicant and be visible from the access point of the site and
must identify the equipment owner of the shelter or cabinet.
c. On tower sites, an FCC registration number, as applicable, is also to be
present.
d. The signs shall not be lighted, unless required for security purposes.
e. No other signage, including advertising, shall be permitted.
f. No sign shall exceed 4 square feet in size.
E. Compliance with FCC Standards governing RF Radiation
1. Compliance Required: All Wireless Telecommunications Facilities shall be in
compliance with the most recent Federal Communications Commissions
regulations governing exposure to RF Radiation (i.e. NIER or Non-Ion
Emitting Radiation) for the general public as determined on a cumulative basis
reflecting the emissions from all equipment associated with the WTF.
2. Notice to be Posted: All WTFs shall be posted with a sign denoting the
minimum distance from any antennas an individual may safely stand without
being exposed to RF radiation in excess of the FCCs permitted standards and
any portion(s) of the structure or the surrounding area that would be exposed
to RF radiation in excess of the FCCs permitted standards. In such an instance
the RF Radiation from all wireless facilities at that location shall be included in
the calculations to show the cumulative effect on any area of the building or
structure or area around the WTF deemed accessible by the public or workers.
3. Post Construction Survey may be Required: In certain instances, the town
may deem it appropriate to have an RF survey of the facility performed after
the construction or modification and activation of the facility, such to be done
under the direction of the town or its designee, and an un-redacted copy of the
survey results provided, along with all calculations, prior to issuance of a
Certificate of Compliance.
4. Barricading of Non-Compliant Structures Required: If any section or
portion of the structure to be attached to or the area around it is not in
compliance with the FCCs regulations regarding RF radiation, that section or
portion must be barricaded with a suitable barrier and marked off to discourage
approaching into the area in excess of the FCCs regulations, as well as placing
RF Radiation signs as needed and appropriate to warn individuals of the
potential danger.
F. Location Standards
1. Prohibited Locations: Telecommunications towers shall be prohibited in
Residential Districts, Historic Districts or Renaissance Districts except when no
alternative can provide necessary wireless service in that district.
SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS
3.11 SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS  INFRASTRUCTURE 3
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 3-21
2. New Towers Not Preferred: New Telecommunications towers or increasing
the height of an existing tower shall always be a last resort.
3. Priority Locations: Applicants for Telecommunications towers shall locate,
site and erect said Wireless Telecommunications Facilities in accordance with
the following priorities, in the order listed:
a. On existing Wireless Telecommunications Facilities without increasing the
height or profile of the tower or structure.
b. On town-owned properties or facilities or related public utilities (e.g., water
towers and power line transmission towers).
c. On properties in areas zoned for business use, excluding Renaissance
Districts.
d. On properties in areas zoned for rural use.
4. Justification Required for Non-Preferred Location: If the proposed site is
not proposed for the highest priority listed above, then a detailed explanation
and justification must be provided as to why a site of each and all higher
priority designations was not selected. The applicant must satisfactorily
demonstrate the reason or reasons why such a permit should be granted for the
proposed site, and the hardship that would be incurred by the applicant if the
permit were not granted as proposed. The test for cost-based arguments shall
be commercial impracticability.
5. Reasons for Denial: Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in
an area of highest priority or highest available priority, the town may
disapprove an Application for any of the following reasons:
a. Failure to file a complete application;
b. Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements;
c. Conflict with the historic nature or character of a neighborhood or district;
d. The use or construction of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities which
is contrary to an already stated purpose of a specific zoning or land use
designation;
e. The need for a zoning variance;
f. The placement and location of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities
which would create an unacceptable risk, or the reasonable probability of
such, to residents, the public, employees and agents of the town, or
employees of the service provider or other service providers;
g. The placement and location of a WTF would result in a conflict with, or
compromise in or change the nature or character of the surrounding area;
h. Conflicts with the provisions of this section;
i. Failure to submit a complete application as required under this section
after having been provided an opportunity to make complete or otherwise
remedy an incomplete application.
6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, for good cause shown
if it could result in a less intrusive facility or facilities, singly or in combination,
and still accomplish the primary service objective, the town may require the
relocation of a proposed site, including allowing for the fact that relocating the
3
SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS
3.11 SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS  INFRASTRUCTURE
3-22 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
site chosen by the applicant may require the use of more than one site to
provide substantially the same service.
G. Standards for Towers
1. Town Policy: As the town has made the policy decision that more towers of a
shorter height is in the public interest, as opposed to fewer taller towers,
spacing or the distance between towers shall be such that the service may be
provided without exceeding the maximum permitted height.
2. Monopole Required: All new towers shall be of the monopole type.
3. Maximum Height: The maximum permitted total height of a new WTF shall
be 90 feet above pre-construction ground level. The maximum permitted
height is not an as-of-right height, but rather the maximum permitted height
under any circumstances, absent proof of the technological need for a greater
height.
4. Clear Evidence Required: The applicant shall submit clear and convincing
technical documentation justifying the technical need for the total height of any
WTF or Antenna requested and the technical need by a specific carrier or user
of the WTF for such if the antenna is the first antenna to be attached to a
WTF. Documentation must include all modeling data and assumptions used to
produce the evidence at the requested height and a minimum of 10 feet lower
height to enable verification of the need for the requested height.
5. Height Exceptions: Relief from the maximum permitted height of new WTF
shall only be considered where clear and convincing technical evidence
substantiates a taller height is technically necessary for a specific carrier or user
of the WTF for the provision of wireless service primarily and substantially
within the town, to the exclusion of any alternative option that is not
technologically or commercially impractical, and where denial of a taller height
would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless service to the
community by a specific carrier or user of the WTF.
a. If the requested height exceeds the 90 foot maximum permitted height, the
required documentation shall be provided prior to the consideration of a
Special Use Permit request.
b. In determining the necessary height for a WTF, or the height or placement
of a co-location on a WTF, the signal strengths analyzed shall be the
threshold or lowest signal strength at which the customer equipment is
designed to function, which may be required to be determined by the
manufacturers specifications for the customer equipment.
6. Balloon Test Required for New or Expanded Towers: In order to better
inform the public in the case of a new telecommunication tower or an increase
in height of an existing tower, the applicant shall hold a balloon test prior to
the initial public hearing on the application. The applicant shall arrange to fly,
or raise upon a temporary mast, a minimum of a 10 foot in length brightly
colored balloon at the maximum height of the proposed new tower.
a. Sign Required: At least 14 days prior to the conduct of the balloon test, a
sign containing the times and date(s) of the balloon test and contact
information shall be erected so as to be clearly visible from the road
nearest the proposed site and shall be removed no later than 14 days after
the conduct of the balloon test. The sign shall be at least 4 feet by 8 feet in
size.
b. Published Notification: The dates, (including a second date, in case of
SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS
3.11 SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS  INFRASTRUCTURE 3
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 3-23
poor visibility or wind in excess of 15 mph on the initial date) times and
location of this balloon test shall be advertised by the applicant 7 and 14
days in advance of the first test date in a newspaper with a general
circulation in the town. The applicant shall inform the town in writing, of
the dates and times of the test, at least 14 days in advance. The balloon
shall be flown for at least 4 consecutive hours between 10:00 am and 2:00
p.m. on the dates chosen. The primary date shall be on a week-end, but the
second date, in case of poor visibility on the initial date, may be on a week
day. A report with pictures from various locations of the balloon shall be
provided with the application.
c. Notification to adjacent property owners: The applicant shall notify all
property owners by first-class mail located within 1,500 feet of the nearest
property line of the proposed site and of the date(s) and time(s) of the
balloon test. Such notice shall be provided at least 14 days prior to the
conduct of the balloon test.
7. Tower Setbacks: All proposed Telecommunications Towers and any other
unattached proposed WTF support structures shall be set back from abutting
parcels, recorded rights-of-way and road and street lines by the greater of the
following distances:
a. A distance equal to the height of the proposed tower or other support
structure plus 10% of the height of the structure, otherwise known as the
Fall Zone or the existing setback requirement of the underlying zoning
district, whichever is greater.
b. Any accessory structure shall be located within the footprint as approved
in the Special Use Permit and so as to comply with the applicable
minimum setback requirements for the property on which it is situated.
c. The Fall Zone shall be measured from the nearest portion of the right-ofway
of any public road or thoroughfare or property line and any occupied
building or domicile to the nearest point of the support structure. Further,
the nearest portion of any access road leading to a wireless
Telecommunications facility shall be no less than 15 feet from the nearest
property line, other than at the point of access from another road,
thoroughfare or driveway.
d. There shall be no development of habitable buildings within the Fall Zone.
8. Structural Engineer Certification Required: All towers shall be certified as
being structurally adequate by a licensed structural engineer to be in accordance
with all local, state and federal structural requirements for loads, including wind
and ice loads and including, but not limited to all applicable ANSI guidelines
(e.g., ANSI-EIA/TIA 222) and any such certification shall be accompanied by
a detailed structural report, including all supporting calculations. No WTF shall
have equipment attached to it that exceeds a literal 100% of the loading and
stress capability the WTF is designed to support.
9. Removal and Performance Security: The applicant and the owner of record
of any proposed Wireless Telecommunications Facilities property site shall, at
its sole cost and expense, be jointly required to execute and file with the town a
bond, or other form of security acceptable to the town as to type of security
and the form and manner of execution, in an amount of at least $75,000 for a
tower and with such sureties as are deemed sufficient by the town to assure the
faithful performance of the terms and conditions of this section and any
conditions of any Special Use Permit issued pursuant to this section. The full
3
SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS
3.11 SUPPLEMENTAL USE STANDARDS  INFRASTRUCTURE
3-24 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
amount of the bond or security shall remain in full force and effect throughout
the term of the Special Use Permit and/or in the case of abandonment until
any necessary site restoration is completed to restore the site to a condition
comparable to that which existed prior to the issuance of the original Special
Use Permit.
H. Tower-Sharing/Co-Location
1. Tower Sharing/Co-Location Required: The WTF shall be structurally
designed to accommodate at least six antenna arrays as regards the load and
stress created on the structure, with each array to be sited in such a manner as
to provide for flush attachments to the greatest extent possible with the
minimum separation required to achieve the co-locations in the minimum
height possible without causing RF interference or physical conflict.
2. Special Use Permit Not Required for Eligible Facilities: There shall be no
Special Use Permit required for an application that qualifies as an Eligible
Facility.
3. Variations to Standards: As a means of minimizing the height necessary, a
claim of interference because of a need to have greater than 6 feet of vertical
clearance between facilities, measured from the vertical centerline of one array
to the vertical centerline of another, must be proven by technical data showing
that there is no technological alternative that would enable the service to be
provided that would require less vertical space. This requirement may be
waived, provided that the Applicant, in writing, demonstrates that the
provisions of future shared usage beyond 6 users of the WTF is not reasonably
feasible.
4. Feasibility for Co-Location: The applicant for a new Tower or other support
structure shall provide information necessary to determine whether co-location
is feasible based upon the kind of WTF site and structure proposed and the
available space on existing structures and approved Wireless
Telecommunications Facilities. The same shall be required for a Substantial
Modification application showing that there is no alternative other than to
increase the height or width of the profile or ground space. The owner of a
proposed new WTF, and his/her successors in interest, shall:
a. Respond within 60 days to a request for information from a potential
shared-use Applicant;
b. Negotiate in good faith concerning future requests for shared use of the
new WTF by other telecommunications providers;
c. Allow shared use of the new WTF if another telecommunications provider
agrees in writing to pay reasonable charges;
d. Failure to abide by the conditions outlined above may be grounds for
revocation of the Special Use Permit.
5. Flush Mounting Required: Unless it can be proven that such would be
technologically impracticable, all antennas attached to a tower or other
structure shall be flush mounted or as near to flush mounted as is possible
without prohibiting or having the effect of prohibiting the provision of service,

5.1 PURPOSE AND INTENT 5
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 5-1
Building Design Standards
5.1 PURPOSE AND INTENT
The purpose of establishing supplementary requirements for development is to ensure that the physical
characteristics of proposed development are compatible with the context of the surrounding areas and to
preserve the unique visual character and streetscapes of Wake Forest. These requirements strike a balance
between creativity and innovation on one hand while avoiding obtrusive, incongruous structures on the
other. Wake Forest strongly encourages architectural styles that build upon and promote the existing
historic character of the town and supports the view that inspiring, well-maintained, and harmonious
development is in the best economic development interests of all residents and businesses.
5.2 APPLICABILITY AND ADMINISTRATION
The provisions outlined in this chapter shall apply throughout the jurisdiction of this code, regardless of
the underlying zoning district provisions and shall apply to all development, including renovations,
remodelings, face lifts, repainting, and additions to existing structures. The notable exception may be any
Planned Unit Development District, which is intended to create its own building design standards, so long
as they are of equal or greater quality to the standards set forth in this section herein. The building type
standards only apply to those buildings which are specified for the various zoning districts in this chapter.
This chapter is comprised of a combination of quantitative, easily measureable standards for
administrative review and qualitative standards for discretionary review. For those qualitative standards (as
noted) that require a discretionary review for compliance, such applications will be reviewed and approved
in accordance with Section 15.8.5 by the Design Review Board.
5.2.1 APPLICATION OF BUILDING TYPE REQUIREMENTS
While it is expected that some new building types will be introduced to the town, these
variations should be based upon the predominant types listed in this chapter. Innovative
planning or design ideas for development in any district where the proposed building
types are different than those allowed by the base district requirements may be approved
by the Design Review Board in accordance with the discretionary review standards in
Section 5.10. All buildings greater than 100,000 square feet in total area shall be subject
to the standards of the specific building type and shall be approved by the Design
Review Board in accordance with Section 5.10.
5.2.2 ADOPTED PLANS OR HISTORIC GUIDELINES TO TAKE PRECEDENCE
Where specific architectural elements are required as part of an adopted plan or
associated with local historic guidelines, these shall take precedence over the building
design requirements of this chapter. In the case of a contributing building to a National
Register Historic District, the Secretary of Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation will be
used as a guideline for exterior work.
5.2.3 APPLICABILITY OF STANDARDS
The provisions in this chapter shall apply to all new structures and expansions to
existing structures in accordance with the following:
A. New Structures: All standards apply.
B. Expansions of Less Than 50% of Floor Area: Standards apply to expansion area
only and those areas necessary to visually tie the new to the old.

5.3 PRIVATE FRONTAGE REGULATIONS
5-2 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
C. Expansions of 50% or Greater in Floor Area: All standards apply to facades
visible from the public right-of-way.
5.2.4 MODIFICATION OF STANDARDS/DESIGN EXCEPTIONS
The Administrator may make modifications to the standards in this section upon the
written request of the applicant if the standard(s) in question conflicts with other
requirements by law, as long as the proposal is in compliance with the Purpose and
Intent above. If the applicant and Administrator cannot come to an agreement the
proposal shall be submitted to the Design Review Board for review at their next
available meeting in accordance with Section 15.8.5.
5.3 PRIVATE FRONTAGE REGULATIONS
Private frontage regulations have been established for buildings in the urban districts (UR, RMX, NMX,
BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS
5.4 CIVIC / INSTITUTIONAL BUILDINGS 5
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 5-3
UMX and RA-HC). Buildings in these districts shall conform to a private frontage type, as described in
the table below, which is permitted within their associated zoning district by the table in Section 2.2.3.
5.4 CIVIC / INSTITUTIONAL BUILDINGS
CIVIC / INSTITUTIONAL BUILDINGS
The Civic/Institutional Building serves as a landmark and
a public gathering place. The use of this designation is
limited to public buildings (e.g., schools, fire stations, and
town halls), and semi-public buildings (e.g., hospitals and
religious institutions). The Civic/Institutional Building
defines a sense of prominence or to accommodate the
unique needs of its users.
Typological Variants:
Churches
Schools
Museums
Hospitals
Town Hall
Child / Adult Care Centers (more than 8 persons)
Recreation / Clubhouse Buildings
5.4.1 APPLICABILITY AND REVIEW PROCESS
Because of the often unique design requirements and the expected prominence of
certain Civic/Institutional buildings, the process for review and approval shall be
different than those of the other building types listed in this section. It requires that
additional standards, as set forth below, be met, but relaxes some of the standards found
in the applicable land development district. Approval of all Civic/ Institutional Buildings
shall be vested solely with the Design Review Board in accordance with Section 15.8.5
subject to the following standards.
5.4.2 STANDARDS FOR DESIGN REVIEW
The Design Review Board in reviewing the application shall consider the following in
their review and approval of all Civic/ Institutional buildings. Each application shall be
considered unique to the sponsoring applicant and location and therefore shall not be
bound by previous decisions as precedents.
A. Design and Construction Excellence: Such buildings should be constructed as
permanent additions to the long-term vibrancy of the town and should serve to
exemplify the very best architectural designs and building practices.
B. Site Prominence: Designers should consider methods in which to place such
buildings above the grade of the surrounding buildings as a means to provide site
prominence. Methods to consider include the incorporation of a raised entry from
the primary street frontage (while still accommodating NC Accessibility Code
requirements) and/or the setback of such buildings to create a formal landscaped
area or plaza. Where possible, such buildings shall form a terminating vista down a
street or across a civic space whenever possible.
C. Building Design Elements: The nature and location of the building should be
demonstrated in the architectural design and the detailing. Depending on the
expressed architectural style of the building the following elements may be
considered for inclusion:
5
BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS
5.4 CIVIC / INSTITUTIONAL BUILDINGS
5-4 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
? Pronounced window lintels/sills/muntins/etc.
? Columns with a capital and a base.
? A water table made up of large, quality masonry units (such as cut or hew
stone) or made of smaller masonry units that extend beyond the face of the
façade in order to clearly delineate the water table.
? Vertically oriented windows of at least 2:1 ratio.
? Relief in the façade must occur on many levels (the depth of the relief cannot
be limited to 1 or 2 patterns repeated).
? Cornice lines with significant depth and multiple levels of relief.
? A very well designed entry way, including doors at the main entry that are
monumental (taller, larger, heavier, more ornately designed, etc. than normal).
? A tower element of some nature.
D. High Quality Materials: Acceptable exterior primary wall materials for such
buildings include brick, stacked stone, lap siding (cementitious fiber board), stucco,
stone/stone masonry units, and architectural concrete masonry units (CMU).
Exterior insulation finishing systems (EIFS) may be used as a secondary building
material. Under no circumstances shall unfinished concrete block be permitted. No
vinyl or metal siding shall be attached to any side of a civic/institutional building
that is visible from a public street.
E. Material Colors: Facade colors shall be of low reflectance earth tone, muted,
subtle, or neutral colors. Building trim may feature brighter colors as an accent
material. The use of high-intensity, metallic, fluorescent, day glow, or neon colors
shall be prohibited. Variations in color schemes are encouraged in order to
articulate entry ways and public amenities so as to give greater recognition to these
features.
F. Submittals: Color samples shall be provided to the staff at the time of site plan
review and prior to renovations, remodeling, facelift, and repainting, along with a
description of how and where each color will be used. Colored renderings shall also
be required.

5.8 INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS
INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS
Industrial buildings are expected to be utilitarian in
design to accommodate a wide range of internal
activities that range from heavy machinery to storage.
The industrial building typically has 4 yards (front yard;
2 side yards; and rear yard) to allow for site
landscaping to soften the often long expanses of wall
that are typical to this type.
Typological Variants
Industrial  Historic (multi-story)
Industrial Warehouse  New
5.8.1 APPLICABILITY
The following standards are applicable to all industrial buildings.
5.8.2 FACADE MATERIALS & COLORS
A. Materials: Industrial building walls shall be predominantly brick, stucco,
architectural concrete masonry units (CMU), or EIFS. Vinyl or metal sheeting is
prohibited on the front elevations and any side elevations within 20 feet of the front
elevation. Under no circumstances shall unfinished concrete block be permitted.
B. Material Colors: Facade colors shall be of low reflectance earth tone, muted,
subtle, or neutral colors. Building trim may feature brighter colors as an accent
material. The use of high-intensity, metallic, fluorescent, day glow, or neon colors
shall be prohibited. Variations in color schemes are encouraged in order to
articulate entry ways and public amenities so as to give greater recognition to these
features.
C. Submittals: Color samples shall be provided to the staff at the time of site plan
review and prior to renovations, remodelings, facelift, and repainting, along with a
description of how and where each color will be used. Colored renderings shall also
be required.
5.8.3 FAÇADE ARTICULATION
Articulation involves the horizontal and vertical variation of the façade so that walls are
subdivided into bays or sections that are vertically proportioned. The following
provisions for façade articulation shall apply to any façade visible from a public street or
civic space. For buildings set back more than 200 feet from the street, the standards in
this subsection apply only to the primary façade facing the street.
A. Articulation
1. The frontage of buildings shall be divided into architecturally distinct sections
or bays with each section taller than it is wide.

varied topography of Wake Forest. If, due to the topography of the site, a physical
screen would not suffice, alternative methods to minimize the negative aesthetics of the
otherwise utilitarian equipment (e.g., painting the equipment to match the building) may
be approved by the Administrator.
5.9 MANUFACTURED HOMES
5.9.1 APPLICABILITY
All manufactured homes permitted shall comply with the requirements of 5.3 above
(unless the standards below conflict and shall therefore take precedence) and must
comply with the standards established by the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and
Safety Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. § 5401, et seq and that satisfies each of the following
additional criteria:

O. The siding color shall be compatible with the immediate neighborhood and shall
not have a reflectivity exceeding that of white paint.
It is the intent of these criteria to ensure that a Class A Manufactured Home, when
installed, shall have substantially the appearance of an on-site, conventionally built,
single-family home.
5.10 DISCRETIONARY REVIEW STANDARDS
The requirements of this chapter are intended to facilitate a wide variety of uses in close proximity to one
another through the use of detailed design standards that address the key considerations of the pedestrian
realm. That is, their primary focus is on the ground floor and those portions of the building that are most
readily visible to a typical pedestrian. A secondary focus is the overall aesthetic of community and the
visual perceptions that encourage a vibrant economy. The general standards noted below are intended to
be used by the Design Review Board in their review of those applications that require additional review
beyond the detailed building type design provisions found in the subsequent sections. Each application
shall be considered unique to the sponsoring applicant and location and therefore shall not be bound by
previous decisions as precedents.
5.10.1 CONFORMITY TO THE COMMUNITY PLAN PRINCIPLES FOR BUILDING AND SITE
DESIGN
A. New, expanding, or improved businesses should employ architectural standards
consistent with Wake Forests architectural character and should avoid standard
prototype designs otherwise employed in Anywhere, USA.
B. Exceptional locations, views and vistas in the town should receive exceptional
treatment and/or protection in design and development.
C. Noteworthy buildings, important outdoor spaces, objects of historic merit,
important monuments, and significant works of art should be placed in positions of
visibility and prominence. Their placement should be coordinated with street
design.
BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS
5.10 DISCRETIONARY REVIEW STANDARDS 5
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 5-21
D. Significant natural and existing man-made elements should be incorporated into the
thematic design of new developments.
E. Large trees, ponds, creeks, or other natural features of the landscape should be
saved when locating new streets, buildings, parking lots, etc.
F. Community character should be supported by development that is compatible when
considered within the context of the surrounding area.
G. Exterior lighting should be attractive, functional and safety conscious, while also
avoiding negative impacts on the night sky visibility of Wake Forest.
5.10.2 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE
All buildings should be constructed as permanent additions to the long-term vibrancy of
the town and should serve to exemplify the very best architectural designs and building
practices.
5.10.3 MATERIALS & COLORS
A. Building Materials: The predominant material palette for non-residential
structures in Wake Forest is brick. Other acceptable exterior primary wall materials
for such buildings include stacked stone, lap siding (cementitious fiber board),
stucco, stone/stone masonry units, and architectural concrete masonry units
(CMU). Exterior insulation finishing systems (EIFS) may be used as a secondary
building material. Under no circumstances shall unfinished concrete block be
permitted. No vinyl or metal siding shall be attached to any side of a
civic/institutional building that is visible from a public street.
B. Material Colors: Facade colors shall be of low reflectance earth tone, muted,
subtle, or neutral colors. Building trim may feature brighter colors as an accent
material. The use of high-intensity, metallic, fluorescent, day glow, or neon colors
shall be prohibited. Variations in color schemes are encouraged in order to
articulate entry ways and public amenities so as to give greater recognition to these
features.
C. Submittals: Color samples shall be provided to the staff at the time of site plan
review and prior to renovations, remodelings, facelift, and repainting, along with a
description of how and where each color will be used. Colored renderings shall also
be required.
5.10.4 COMPATIBILITY
A. All development subject to this section shall be compatible with the established
architectural character of the town by using a design that is complementary to
existing town architectural styles, designs, and forms. As a means to provide
guidance for the design of buildings that integrate well into the context of Wake
Forest, this section has identified 8 key features necessary to ensure compatibility:

BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS
5.10 DISCRETIONARY REVIEW STANDARDS
5-22 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
1. Street Frontage: Along
residential side streets, limit
interruptions to front setback
landscaping. A key way of
achieving this is by preserving
existing front yard landscaping
and minimizing the amount of
frontage devoted to paved
vehicle areas.

Development
City of Portland Bureau of Planning, December, 2008
2. Rhythm Of Development
Along The Street: Continue
established building rhythms
along street frontages. Avoid
monolithic massing that
disrupts fine-grain
neighborhood or mixed-use
corridor pattern.
Image Source: The Infill Design Toolkit: Medium-Density Residential
Development
City of Portland Bureau of Planning, December, 2008
3. Building Frontages: Along
street frontages, orient
windows, main entrances, and
other primary building façade
elements toward the street.
Care should be taken to avoid
the appearance of buildings
turning their backs or sides
toward the street. Courtyard
buildings can contribute to
this by orienting main
entrances toward courtyards
that serve as a semi-public
extension of the public realm
of adjacent streets.

Development
City of Portland Bureau of Planning, December, 2008
4. Front Setback Patterns:
Continue established building
setback patterns, where this is
a neighborhood priority and is
practical. Note: Deep front
setbacks can compromise the
ability to provide backyard
space and/or rear parking,
particularly at higher densities.

5. Landscaping And Trees:
Use landscaping and trees to
achieve compatibility in areas
where these are unifying
elements of community
character.
6. Viewshed Protection:
Important vistas and views of
the Southeastern Baptist
Theological Seminarys church
steeple shall be protected and
accentuated to the extent
practical.
7. Architectural Features:
Consider designing buildings
to respond to prevalent
architectural features of the
surrounding context,
especially in areas where
patterns established by
recurring architectural features
are well-documented and
valued. Consideration should
also be given to avoid mimicry
of existing buildings, so that
opportunities for the
continuation of the evolution
of architectural style are not
stifled.
8. Street Vistas: Important
street vistas (such as along
town gateways and primary
pedestrian streets) should
terminate in a focal point,
such as a building or other
architectural or landscape
feature.

6.5.1 STREET NETWORK
A. General: Streets shall be designed and located in proper relation to existing and
proposed streets, to the topography, to such natural features as streams and tree
growth, to public safety and convenience, and to the proposed use of land to be
served by such streets. All proposed streets shall provide for the appropriate
projection of principal streets in surrounding areas and provide reasonable access
for surrounding acreage or tracts. Requirements may vary at the discretion of the
Administrator where compliance is determined not feasible because of topography,
the existence of environmentally sensitive lands, the need to preserve cultural
resources, and/or other similar considerations.
B. Streets to be Interconnected: All streets shall be designed to form part of an
interconnected street pattern. Streets must connect with adjacent street networks to
the extent possible. Street designs will be assessed, in terms of meeting this
interconnectivity standard, on their ability to: permit multiple routes between
origin/destination points; diffuse traffic; and, shorten walking distances.
C. Block Lengths: Block lengths shall adhere to the standards in the following table:
Minimum Block Length Maximum Block Length
Rural & Suburban Districts* 250 feet 800 feet

D. Block Width: Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for 2 tiers of lots of
appropriate depth except where otherwise required to separate residential
development from through traffic.
E. Cul-de-Sacs: Permanent dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs shall be no longer than
400 feet. In general, streets with one end permanently closed shall be avoided unless
the design of the subdivision and the existing or proposed street system in the
surrounding area clearly indicates that a through street is not essential at the
location of the proposed cul-de-sac.
F. Reserve Strips Prohibited: Reserve strips and non-access easements adjoining
street rights-of-way for the purpose of preventing access to or from adjacent
property (except those required by the Board of Commissioners to prevent access
to thoroughfares), and half-streets shall not be permitted.
G. Subdivision Access Points: Subdivisions shall maintain external access points
through street connections to existing roads and/or stubs to future development at
the rate of at least one external access point for every 100 single family lots.
H. Street Stubs:
1. Connection to Street Stubs Required: New developments shall connect to
any existing street stubs from adjacent properties.
2. Street Stub Prioritization: New development shall stub to all adjacent
properties where practical at the rate of at least one street stub per 800 feet of
property boundary when connecting to rural and suburban districts and at least
one stub per 400 feet when connecting to urban districts. The location of new
required street stubs shall be prioritized as follows: (See illustration below)

designated drainageway at the property line to make the required
connection to an adjacent parcel, the owner or applicant shall provide a
payment in lieu of building the stream crossing equal to half the total cost
of the construction based on an engineer certified estimate. Such payment
shall be set aside to offset the cost of constructing the stream crossing for
future development.
3. Stub Street Details: Stub streets and streets intended for extension during
future phases shall be designed and constructed to the property line or as close
to the line, vertically and horizontally, as practical. It shall be the responsibility
of the second development to construct the connection to an existing stub
street. Stub streets shall not exceed 150 feet in length without a paved
turnaround (permanent or temporary) per the MSSD. A clearly visible street
sign shall be erected at the end of the stub street stating that the street is
planned to connect to a future street. See MSSD for sign specifications.

6.11 TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS
The Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) is a specialized study that evaluates the effects of a
developments traffic on the surrounding transportation infrastructure. The TIA helps identify where the
development may have a significant impact on safety, traffic and transportation operations, and provides a
means for the developer and government agencies to mitigate these impacts. Ultimately, the TIA can be
used to evaluate whether the scale of development is appropriate for a particular site and what
improvements may be necessary, on and off the site, to provide safe and efficient access and traffic flow.
6.11.1 WHEN REQUIRED
The necessary level of analysis for different development categories is defined in the
following table:

UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 6-21
B. Description of Development: Describe acreage included in development, existing
and proposed land use, existing and proposed zoning, proposed density (number of
houses, square feet of development, etc.)
C. Study Area: Generally ¼ mile to ½ mile from each proposed site access along
roads accessed by the site. This area may, in a few cases, be greater if the site is on
a road with no intersections within that distance.
D. Site Location: Include location map showing site in relation to major streets and at
least one-mile radius from site.
E. Traffic Generation: Indicate number of trips generated by site daily, AM peak
hour, PM peak hour (AM peak hour may be omitted for retail uses which are not
expected to generate significant traffic volumes during this period). Indicate
internal or pass-by traffic generation if appropriate. For rezoning, indicate traffic
generation under existing zoning as well as proposed zoning. Indicate source of
trip generation rate, land use code, and units used to derive generation.
F. Trip Distribution: Indicate percentage distribution of trips, by direction, within
study area and method used to obtain.
G. Access Location(s): Location of planned streets or driveways and access to
existing streets. Indicate other streets or driveways within study area, including
those across the street. Indicate coordination with NCDOT where appropriate.
H. Existing Road and Traffic Conditions: Street laneage and classification, traffic
control devices, existing daily traffic volumes within study area. Show traffic
volumes and level of service of signalized intersections and proposed site access
points within study area during AM and PM peak hour (PM only for retail). Include
work sheets or computer printouts showing counted traffic volumes and level-ofservice.
Illustrate in figure(s) showing peak hour volumes, lanes, and level of
service. For unsignalized intersections, show level-of-service for individual
movements. Discuss transit service if applicable. Discuss accident history, if
appropriate.
I. Planned Improvements: Discuss and describe any planned road improvements in
the study area which could affect future traffic. Note whether project is shown on
thoroughfare plan, collector street plan, or NCDOT TIP.
J. Future Conditions: Same as for existing conditions, plus site traffic assigned to
driveways or access points, for condition with full build-out of project, at build-out
year. Include growth in background traffic due to other approved developments or
to general growth in area. May show more than one phase, if project is to be
phased. Discuss any conflict with other driveways or streets, queuing problems,
potential safety problems.
K. Pedestrian Facilities: Indicate location of existing and proposed sidewalks and
crosswalks, internal pedestrian paths.
L. Recommended Improvements: Indicate improvements required for access points
and signalized intersections within study area to operate at acceptable level of
service (D or better). These may include site access, internal site circulation,
signalization, signal modification (retiming, additional phases), lane modifications or
additions, or street widening. A signal warrant study is not required but may be
included as supporting documentation where a traffic signal is requested. Note:
showing recommended improvements does not necessarily indicate responsibility
for improvement. Report may indicate which improvements are due to
development and which are due to existing problems or other growth in traffic, and
6
INFRASTRUCTURE STANDARDS
6.11 TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS
6-22 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
may suggest responsibility of developer or of other parties for improvements.
Proposed improvements should be shown schematically on figure.
M. Engineers Seal: All TIAs are to be prepared and sealed by an engineer registered
in the State of North Carolina and specializing in traffic or transportation, with
experience in preparing TIAs.
6.11.3 ENHANCED TIA REQUIREMENTS
An enhanced TIA includes all of the elements of a standard TIA plus the following:
A. Study Area: Generally from 1 to 3 miles from each proposed site access along
roads accessed by the site. The extent of the study area should be discussed with
town staff prior to initiating the TIA.
B. Internal Circulation: Review internal circulation patterns and note recommended
changes.
C. Trip Distribution: Use of a computer model for distribution may be desirable for
major projects.
D. Future Conditions: Projects in this category, other than perhaps shopping centers,
are likely to be phased. It is desirable to show conditions at end of planning period
(generally 20-year or horizon used for thoroughfare plan).
E. Recommended Improvements: For major projects, these may involve changes to
the thoroughfare plan or collector street plan. The project may include the
construction of portions of thoroughfares within or adjacent to the site.
6.11.4 IMPROVEMENTS MAY BE REQUIRED
Based on the findings of the analysis, if a proposed development does not meet the
applicable service level standards, the applicant shall be required to upgrade the facilities
in accordance with the adopted level of service program. Mitigation measures may
involve strategies other than roadway construction or other physical improvements such
as changes to traffic signal timing or phasing, and transportation management strategies.
6.11.5 THRESHOLDS FOR MITIGATION
The town requires consideration of roadway and/or
operational improvements when the proposed
development increases the intersection Volume-to-
Capacity Ratio (V/C) beyond the thresholds
indicated in the table at right. The town evaluates
the impacts of proposed development at
intersections (primarily under existing year
conditions) based on the increase in V/C ratio as a
result of the projected site traffic. This increase is
determined by comparing the V/C ratio under
existing development conditions and proposed
development conditions. For the purposes of this
comparison, all unsignalized intersections are
analyzed as signalized intersections.
Existing V/C
Allowable
Increase in V/C

Tree Protection, Buffers & Landscaping
8.1 PURPOSE
It is the intent of this chapter to protect, refurbish, and improve the aesthetic appeal, scenic beauty,
historic character and economic value of properties within the Town of Wake Forest. The regulations
in this chapter seek to maintain an overall coverage of mature trees and existing landscaping for the
community in order to:
? Maximize the economic vitality and positive community image associated with the towns
mature vegetation;
? Protect and enhance property values;
? Maintain the aesthetic quality of the community as a whole;
? Moderate climate and reduce energy costs; and
? Mitigate the negative impacts of noise, glare, air and water pollution, and soil erosion on the
environment of the town and on its inhabitants.
8.2 APPLICABILITY
8.2.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
The requirements of this section shall apply to all land, public and private, in the
Wake Forest zoning jurisdiction. Occupancy certificates for uses authorized by this
ordinance shall not be issued until such requirements are installed, unless provided
otherwise in this section.
8.2.2 EXEMPTIONS
The following conditions are exempt from the provisions of this chapter:
A. Improvements or repairs to interior and exterior features of existing structures
or buildings which do not result in expansions or changes in the type of
occupancy as set forth in the North Carolina Building Code.
B. A single-family detached dwelling on an individual lot of record.
C. Property covered by an active forestry management plan written by a North
Carolina Registered Forester, provided documentation has been furnished to
the town.
8.2.3 PRE-EXISTING DEVELOPMENT
A. Non-conforming preexisting development is subject to these standards as
follows:
1. A change in type of occupancy, as set forth in the North Carolina Building
Code;
2. A change in land use which requires an increase in the number of off-street
parking spaces or the provision of a buffer yard;
3. Additions or expansions which singularly or collectively exceed 25% of the
land area or gross building floor area existing at the effective date of this
ordinance.
B. The Town of Wake Forest recognizes that designing preexisting development
to meet new regulations is more difficult and expensive than applying these
standards to undeveloped properties. Therefore, greater flexibility will be
8

8-2 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
afforded preexisting development in meeting the requirements of this section,
in that:
1. A variance of up to 25% percent may be granted by the Administrator for
planting area and dimension requirements where compliance presents
hardships due to building location, lot size, or vehicular area configuration;
2. A credit for reducing required off-street parking by 1 space shall be given
for the construction of each landscape island.
8.2.4 PROCEDURES
A. When an application is made for a development approval on any land to which
the requirements of this section apply, a Landscape Plan shall be prepared as
part of the Site Master Plan as outlined in Section 15.8. The specific
requirements for a Landscape Plan are included in the checklist for Site Master
Plans in the Wake Forest Manual of Specifications, Standards and Design
(MSSD).
B. All planting materials specified by the landscape plan shall be installed prior to
the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. An exception may be granted for
a period not to exceed 180 days for the following circumstances, as determined
by the Administrator:
1. The unavailability of specified plant material;
2. Weather conditions that prohibit the completion of the project or
jeopardize the health of the plant material;
3. Actions or directives issued by any governing body with jurisdictional
authority.
C. In such circumstances, the property owner or developer shall submit
documentation of the estimated cost for the purchase and installation of the
required planting areas and may be required to post a performance guarantee
equal to the amount of the contract. The Administrator may issue a
Conditional Certificate of Occupancy but shall not issue a Final Certificate of
Occupancy until the planting requirements have been completed and approved.
8.2.5 ALTERNATE METHODS OF COMPLIANCE
A. Alternate landscaping plans, plant materials, planting methods or reforestation
may be used where unreasonable or impractical situations would result from
application of landscaping or tree preservation requirements. Such situations
may result from streams, natural rock formations, topography, or other physical
conditions; or from lot configuration, utility easements, unified development
design, or unusual site conditions.
B. The Administrator may approve an alternate plan, which proposes different
plant materials or methods provided that quality, effectiveness, durability, and
performance are equivalent to that required by this section.
C. Decisions of the Administrator regarding alternate methods of compliance for
landscaping and tree preservation may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment
according to the provisions of Section 15.12.

UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 8-3
8.3 TREE CANOPY COVERAGE REQUIREMENT
8.3.1 MINIMUM CANOPY COVERAGE REQUIREMENT
All parcels, regardless of land use, shall maintain a minimum tree canopy coverage
according to their district classification as follows:
District Canopy Coverage Requirement
Rural and Suburban Districts 2 canopy trees per 5,000 sq. ft. of parcel area, OR
1 canopy tree and 1 understory tree per 4,000 sq. ft. of parcel
area
UR, RMX 1 canopy tree per 10,000 sq. ft. of parcel area
NMX, RA-HC, UMX, PUD 1 canopy tree per 10,000 sq. ft. of parcel area  may be waived or
altered by the Administrator depending on lot coverage of
proposed development and adequate street tree installation.
8.3.2 PRIORITY TREE PROTECTION AREAS
The minimum canopy coverage requirement may be met through the retention of
existing vegetation, supplemental plantings, or a combination of both; however,
every reasonable effort should be made to meet the baseline canopy coverage area
through the retention of existing vegetation in the following priority areas of the
site:
A. Required buffer yards between conflicting uses (as defined in this chapter);
B. Thoroughfare buffers and streetyards;
C. Conservation easements;
D. Special Flood Hazard Areas;
E. Historic, landmark and/or specimen trees which meet the requirements of
Section 8.4.3.
8.4 TREE PRESERVATION
8.4.1 CREDITS FOR TREE PRESERVATION
Credit may be applied toward the baseline tree canopy requirements by the
preservation of existing trees in Priority Tree Protection Areas as well as other
additional tree preservation areas on site. Credit will only be applied to existing
vegetation that is healthy and meets the requirements of this section. Tree credit
rates for each tree preserved shall be determined by the following methods,
schedules and standards:
A. Credit for Preservation of Wooded Areas: In order to receive credit for
wooded areas, the trees contained in these areas shall be a mixture of healthy
and useful canopy and understory trees. The method for calculating tree credits
in wooded areas is as follows: one tree per 700 square feet of protected area.
Watercourse buffer areas and wetlands are not eligible for the tree credit and
the respective amount of parcel area is exempt from the baseline tree coverage
requirement.

D. Invasive, Dead and Unhealthy Trees
1. No credit will be allowed for any invasive exotic tree, dead tree, any tree in
poor health, or any tree subject to grade alterations.
2. The death or unhealthy state of any tree(s) used for preservation credit,
within 3 years of establishing the TSA, shall require the property owner to
plant new trees equal to the number of credited trees.
3. If any tree(s) used for preservation credit is improperly protected or
determined to be hazardous, the Administrator may require new trees be
planted equal to the number of credit trees.
4. The Administrator may require trees left outside preservations areas to be
removed if improperly protected or determined to be hazardous.
E. Land Dedication: Land that is dedicated to the town that is part of the
property being developed may be used towards the tree preservation
requirement, if the dedicated land contains trees that meet the requirements
above.
8.4.2 TREE SAVE AREAS
Trees survive the stress of construction best when they are left in stands or larger
groupings. For that reason, it is encouraged that, wherever possible, the site should
be designed and developed so that tree save areas (TSAs) are designated in a single,
contiguous unit. In order to qualify for the purpose of meeting the requirements of
this section, designated tree save areas must conform to the following standards:
A. Minimum Dimensional Requirements: The extent of the Critical Root
Zone (CRZ) of the tree or trees at the outer edges of the tree save area shall
constitute the limits of construction for the purposes of this sub-section. The
CRZ is the circular area of ground surrounding a tree extending from the
center of tree to the greater of
1. 1.5 feet per caliper inch DBH of the tree,
2. The dripline (furthest extent of tree canopy) of the tree, or
3. 6 feet.
B. Minimum Content Requirements: The TSA should contain, as determined
by an informal site assessment, predominantly canopy tree species which are at
least 2 inches in diameter at breast height (DBH) and a minimum of 10 feet in
height.

8.4 TREE PRESERVATION 8
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 8-5
C. Maintenance & Ownership: When a TSA is established in association with
the incentives as listed in this section, it should be designated, where possible,
as a dedicated open space, or in a conservation easement.
D. Tree Removal Inside Tree Save Areas: Trees that are in poor health or
invasive, exotic species, as determined by the Administrator, may be removed
from tree save areas. All tree removal within TSA must have prior approval by
the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of this section. However, in an
emergency situation due to storm damage, or to alleviate an imminent hazard
to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens, or to repair property damage,
prior approval for tree removal in previously approved designated tree save
areas is not required.
E. Flexibility in Other Requirements: Flexibility in other design requirements
will be considered on a case-by-case basis to accommodate the establishment
of a TSA.
F. Tree Save Area Incentives: The following incentives are offered to encourage
tree preservation in tree save areas.
Action Taken Incentive
A. Single Family Residential
1. Establishment of tree save area
(TSA)
Reduction of minimum lot area equal to area of TSA
(up to 20% maximum reduction)

Reduction by up to 50% of required parking lot
plantings at the rate of one tree for each 200 square
feet of TSA established
8.4.3 SPECIMEN / HISTORIC TREES
It is the intent of this section to promote the preservation of trees which are of a
significant enough size and/or of such a historic nature as to be an asset to the
community as a whole.
A. Specimen Trees: Where there exists one or more Specimen Trees on property
subject to the regulations of this section, every effort shall be made to preserve
and protect that tree or trees, according to the protection standards as outlined
in this section. For the purposes of this section, Specimen Trees shall be
defined as those trees which meet one or more of the following:
1. Any tree in fair or better condition which equals or exceeds the following
diameter sizes or which otherwise is noteworthy because of species, age,
size, or other exceptional quality, uniqueness and rarity:

B. Historic Trees: Where there exists one or more designated Historic Trees on
property subject to the regulations of this section, every effort shall be made to
preserve and protect that tree or trees, according to the methods outlined in
this section. For the purposes of this section, Historic Trees shall be defined as
those trees which meet one or more of the following:
1. Designation as a Historical Tree by the Triangle J Council of Governments
Capital Trees Program;
2. Designation as a Historic Tree by the Wake Forest Board of
Commissioners.
C. Designation: Upon petition by the owner of the property on which the tree(s)
is located, and the recommendation of the Wake Forest Urban Forestry Board,
the Wake Forest Board of Commissioners may designate a specific tree or
group of trees as either a Landmark, Historic, or both. In order to be
designated as such, the following criteria must be demonstrated by the owner:
1. Landmark Trees
a. Using the measurement and point system established for state and
national champion trees, a nominated tree must have a point total of
at least 50% of the current state champion for the particular species;
or be a highly visible or recognizable tree or group of trees which has
significance for the entire community; and,
b. Must exhibit such health, condition, and form as to have a reasonable
prospect of continuing useful life.
2. Historic Trees
a. Must be at least 50 years old and exhibit such health, condition, and
form as to have a reasonable prospect of continuing useful life; and,
b. Must be associated with a specific and significant historic event or
individual; or contribute to the character of a historic building or
property.
D. Replacement of Specimen Trees
1. When a specimen tree is removed from a site during construction, or dies
within 5 years following construction, the applicant or developer shall
replace such tree on the lot with an amount of trees and/or landscaping of
equal value. Valuation of the tree removed or lost shall be determined by
the Administrator in consultation with a person qualified by training or
experience to have expert knowledge of the subject. Valuation of trees and
TREE PROTECTION, BUFFERS & LANDSCAPING
8.4 TREE PRESERVATION 8
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 8-7
vegetation shall be established in accordance with standards established by
the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers (CTLA).
2. If replacement isnt feasible or desired, as determined by the
Administrator, a monetary sum equal to the value of the lost or removed
specimen tree(s) may be paid to a tree planting fund maintained by the
Town of Wake Forest for the purposes of planting and maintaining trees
throughout the jurisdiction of the town.
8.4.4 TREE PROTECTION DURING CONSTRUCTION
It is the intent of this sub-section to establish minimum standards of protection in
order to ensure that trees which are to be saved remain undamaged, thus improving
their long-term chances of survival.
A. Clear Delineation: Tree save areas, buffers or other areas where existing
vegetation is to be preserved shall be delineated on the construction site as it is
shown on the approved landscape plan.
1. All existing trees and vegetation that are to be preserved shall be
completely enclosed with a sturdy and visible fence prior to any land
disturbance. Fencing shall extend to the CRZ. In some instances, the
Administrator may require an additional area of no disturbance.
2. Fencing of areas adjacent to existing and proposed roadways also is
required. Fencing is required on all Town of Wake Forest and State
Department of Transportation road projects that are adjacent to protected
streetscapes or buffers. The tree protection fencing shall be clearly shown
on the site and/or subdivision plan and shall comply with the standards in
the MSSD.
3. A stop work order or notice of violation shall be issued if the project is
found to be out of compliance with this section or an approved Landscape
Plan.
4. All protected trees must be protected from silt with wire mesh fencing, as
provided for in the MSSD, placed along the outer uphill edge of the tree
protection zones at the land disturbance interface.
5. All tree fencing and erosion control measures shall be installed prior to and
maintained throughout the land disturbance process and building
construction and may not be removed until the authorization is given by
the Town of Wake Forest.
B. Prohibited Activities in Tree Save Areas
1. Land Disturbance: There shall be no clearing, excavation, soil
compaction or changes of the existing grade within the delineated tree save
area or tree protection zones. Should the removal of underbrush
vegetation take place, every effort should be made to minimize the
disturbance.
2. Storage of Equipment: The storage of construction or other vehicles
and/or equipment, site construction materials, portable buildings,
including portable toilets, or other heavy objects is prohibited within
delineated tree save areas and tree protection zones.
8
TREE PROTECTION, BUFFERS & LANDSCAPING
8.4 TREE PRESERVATION
8-8 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
3. Encroachments: If during the course of construction, it does become
necessary for activities to take place inside TSA or tree protection zones,
then the Administrator shall be consulted, in advance of any activity. Such
activities include but are not limited to the erection of scaffolding, vehicle
movement, trenching or excavation. The Administrator shall review the
most appropriate way to undertake such activities. If such an
encroachment is anticipated, the following preventive measures shall be
employed at a minimum:
a. Where utilities must encroach upon a delineated tree save area or tree
protection zone, they should be installed by tunneling, rather than by
trenching. If it is necessary for roots to be disturbed, then proper root
pruning procedures shall be employed.
b. The removal of trees adjacent to tree saved areas can cause inadvertent
damage to the protected trees. Wherever possible, it is strongly
recommended to cut minimum one and one-half-foot trenches along
the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear, roots.
c. Where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials through the
tree protection zone, the area must first be mulched with a minimum
6-inch layer of processed pine bark or coarse wood chips (see MSSD).
Equipment or materials storage or disposal shall not be allowed within
tree protection areas.
8.4.5 TREE REPLACEMENT STANDARDS
A. Replacement of Damaged, Removed or Excessively Pruned Trees and
Vegetation: Any tree or vegetation (planted or preserved as part of the
development requirements of this ordinance) that is damaged, removed or
excessively pruned shall be replaced according to the following standards:
1. Square Inch for Square Inch Replacement. Where the cross-sectional
(basal) area can be documented, an equal amount of new vegetation
(square inch for square inch) shall be used to quantify the required
replacement vegetation. All replacement trees shall have a DBH of at least
2 inches each and a cumulative cross-sectional (basal) area equal to or
greater than that of the original tree(s).
2. Area Replacement. For all other cases where existing vegetation is
damaged or removed, the type and amount of replacement vegetation
required shall be the type and amount that is necessary to provide the type
of landscaped areas required under this section and/or as required by the
approved landscape plan.
3. Location of Replacement Vegetation. Replacement vegetation should
be located within the vicinity of the violation. If replacement is not
practical within the vicinity, a more suitable location on the site may be
selected. If no suitable location can be found, a monetary payment may be
required. This monetary payment will be based on the current market price
for any replacement tree(s) and/or shrubs. This payment shall be used to
fund plantings on public properties.
B. Establishment Period: Replacement trees shall be maintained through an
establishment period of at least 2 years. The applicant may be required to post a
performance guarantee acceptable to the town guaranteeing the survival and
health of all replacement trees during the establishment period and
guaranteeing any associated replacement costs. If the replacement trees do not
satisfactorily survive the establishment period in the judgment of the

8.5.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. Buffer Yard Lot Standards
1. The designated buffer yards are intended to be an aggregate dimension
between the competing uses.
2. If a proposed use is to develop next to an undeveloped or vacant property,
the proposed use will be required to designate one-half of the required
buffer yard, but not less than 10 feet in width, based on the previous use or
the potential use of the adjacent property. The potential use of the
adjacent property will be determined by the Administrator according to the
existing zoning of the undeveloped property and the potential use as
shown on the Growth Strategy Map in the Wake Forest Community Plan.
3. If a proposed use is to develop next to an existing land use which was not
previously required to create a buffer yard, the proposed use will be
required to create the entire buffer yard.

are permitted, but should be minimized to the extent feasible.
B. Credit for Existing Vegetation: Existing vegetation in buffer yard areas,
which meets the minimum standards for a tree save area (TSA) in Section 8.4.2,
shall qualify for the screening requirements. Where existing vegetation is
insufficient or must be removed due to construction activity, new plantings
shall be used to supplement any remaining existing vegetation in order to meet
the minimum screening requirements.
C. Ownership of Buffer Yards
1. Any required buffer yard, including those required as a zoning condition,
for a single-family or two-family residential development shall not be
credited toward meeting the minimum lot size requirements.

8.5.4 ADDITIONS TO BUFFERS AND SCREENING
When it is determined that the conflict of land use is so great that the public safety
is not served adequately by the minimum buffer and screening requirements in
Section 8.5.2, or where there is a need to prevent a high degree of visual, audio, or
physical disorder s, then the Administrator may require the installation of fencing or
earthen berms in addition to the minimum required buffers and screening,
according to the standards below.
A. Fencing or Walls: Where required as part of a buffer yard, fencing or walls
must adhere to the provisions below. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the
owner of a single family dwelling from constructing a separate fence along the
borders of such property, provided that all required buffer plantings are
maintained.
1. In all cases, the finished side of the fence must face the use with the lower
intensity.
2. Permitted fence or wall materials include: masonry, stone, architectural
block, stucco on masonry, wood or other similar of solid appearance.
3. The design of fencing or walls shall be sufficient to meet the extent of
physical screening required by the Administrator.
4. The height of the fence shall be determined by the Administrator based on
the following variables: site conditions; topography; use; and/or building
height. The minimum height of a fence or wall required by this section
shall be 6 feet.
B. Berms: Earthen berms may be required in combination with plant material and
fencing for the purposes of screening. Berms shall be tapered appropriately to
allow for practical maintenance.
1. The slope of all berms shall not exceed a 2:1 ratio (horizontal to vertical),
shall have a top width at least one-half the berm height, and a maximum
height of 6 feet above the toe of the berm.
2. All berms regardless of size, shall be stabilized. Topsoils brought in for
mounds are to be mixed with native soil to avoid interfacing problems.
3. Berms shall be constructed as to provide adequate sight distances at
intersections and along all roads.
Berms proposed to satisfy the screening requirements of this section shall
be vegetated as required by this section. Use of berms as a substitute for
existing healthy vegetation is strongly discouraged.

8.6.1 STREET TREE REQUIREMENTS
A. Location: Street trees should be planted in the location specified for the
corresponding street classification in Section 6.7. However, where not practical
due to the location of utilities or other site constraints, street trees may be
planted on private property upon dedication of a tree easement. Tree
easements should be of a sufficient size to allow access by maintenance
equipment to the entirety of the expected mature tree canopy.
B. Minimum Number of Trees: Street trees shall be installed according to the
following minimum standards (linear feet of planting area shall exclude
driveways):
1. At least 1 canopy tree for every 50 linear feet of planting area, or fraction
thereof equal to or greater than 25 feet; or
2. Only when planting of canopy trees is not practical due to the location of
utilities, 1 understory tree for every 35 linear feet of planting area, or
fraction thereof equal to or greater than 18 feet; or
C. Minimum Spacing: Arrangement of and distance between trees is at the
owners option, except that the minimum spacing between trees should
correspond to the expected mature spread of the adjacent trees and in no
instance shall be less than:
1. 30 feet between canopy trees,
2. 20 feet between canopy trees and understory trees, and
3. 15 feet between understory trees.
D. Conflict with Street Lighting: Street trees shall be located and planted so as
not to diminish the effectiveness of required street lighting, and in no instance
shall street lights be located closer than:
1. 15 feet to canopy trees, and
2. 8 feet to understory trees.
E. General Standards
1. The location, species, and approximate planting date of any tree in the
public right-of-way or tree easement must be approved by the
Administrator prior to planting.
2. Street trees shall be installed according to the standards in the Wake Forest

maintained weed free thereafter. The mulch shall not cover the root collar.
L. Trimming and Pruning: All required plantings shall be allowed to reach their
mature size and shall be maintained at their mature size. Trimming and pruning
shall be done in strict accordance with the ANSI A300 standards, as amended
from time to time hereafter. Topping is not an acceptable pruning practice. The
Administrator may require the removal and replacement of any tree(s) that
have been topped or excessively trimmed.
M. Staking: Staking is required only when a plant is unable to support itself with
its existing root system. Examples of this are: bare rooted plants, a strong wind
situation, loose soil, wet conditions, steep slopes and large size plant material.
Tree ties are to be a soft, wide (minimum, 1 inch) polymer material. No knots
are to be tied around the trunk that may restrict growth. Ties are to be removed
after one year following installation.
N. Soil Modification: Soil modifications shall be required on sites where the soil
is poor in quality and structure. Soil modifications may include tilling, deep
ripping, addition of nutrition/fertilizer or other organic compounds,
conditioning additives to effect a change in the water holding capacity of the

chemicals, mulches, otherwise.
8.9.2 MAINTENANCE
It shall be the responsibility of the property owner(s) or assigned caretakers to
ensure that all regulated landscaped areas, buffers, fencing, and tree save areas are
installed, preserved, and maintained in good growing conditions, appearance, and
usefulness. Damage and disturbances to these areas shall result in vegetation
replacement and/or fines and other penalties. Preservation and maintenance shall
include:
A. Any dead, unhealthy, or missing vegetation, shall be replaced with vegetation
that conforms to the standards of this section and the approved site and/or
subdivision plan.
B. All required buffers, streetyards, vehicular use areas, tree save areas and other
landscaped areas shall be free of refuse and debris, shall be treated for
pest/diseases in accordance with the approved site and/or subdivision plan,
and shall be maintained as to prevent mulch, straw, dirt, or other materials
from washing onto streets and sidewalks.
C. The owner(s) shall take actions to protect all plant material from damage during
all facility and site maintenance operations. All plant material must be
maintained in a way that does not obstruct sight distances at roadways and
intersections, obstruct traffic signs or devices, and interfere with the use of
sidewalks or pedestrian trails. Plant material, whether located within buffers,
tree save areas, or within planted areas (required by the site and/or subdivision
plan) shall not be removed, damaged, cut or severely pruned so that their
intended form is impaired. Shrubs within vehicular use areas, streetyards, and
street fronts may be pruned, but must maintain at least 3 feet in height.
D. In the event that existing required vegetation located within any buffers, tree
save areas, streetyards, vehicular use or other landscape areas poses an
immediate or imminent threat to improved structures on private property or
public property, excessive pruning or removal of the vegetation may be

provision of parking facilities must be regulated in order to avoid negative impacts such as:
 Increased storm water volume and velocity,
 Increased surface pollutants,
 Increased surface level heat and glare,
 Reduction in the efficiency of the connecting street system, and
 Reduction in the operations of the surrounding pedestrian and bicycle network.
The purpose of this chapter is to ensure the adequate provision of parking in Wake Forest without
degrading the urban or natural environment.
9.2 APPLICABILITY
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all new and expanded development, as well as any changes in

C. OFF-STREET PARKING SCHEDULE C
Uses that are not listed in Schedule A or that reference Schedule C have widely varying
parking and loading demand characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single offstreet
parking or loading standard. Upon receiving a development application for a use
subject to Schedule C standards, the Administrator shall apply the off-street parking and
loading standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed
use, or shall establish minimum off-street parking requirements based on a parking and
loading study prepared by the applicant. Such a study must include estimates of parking
demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other
acceptable estimates as approved by the Administrator, and should include other reliable
data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as, or comparable
with, the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area,
type of activity, and location. The study must document the source of data used to
develop the recommendations.
9.4.2 MAXIMUM PARKING
The minimum parking requirements above have intentionally been set below general
market expectations as a means to mitigate against the negative aspects of paved
surfaces on the environment such as excessive water runoff, water pollution, and urban
heat island effect. To this end, there shall also be a maximum parking standard for large
parking facilities as follows:
A. Pervious Pavement Required
1. If a parking lot exceeds 150 spaces and includes more than twice the minimum
number of spaces established for a use, as outlined in Section 9.4.1 above, any
parking spaces over twice the minimum required must be installed using
pervious pavement systems only.
2. If there are no minimum parking requirements for the use given in Section
9.4.1 above, the maximum parking standard shall be 35% of the site area.
B. Exception: Where poorly draining soil types prevent the use of this technique, the
Administrator may grant an exception to the maximum parking standard above
upon sufficient justification from the applicant of the need for such extra parking
facilities.
9.4.3 EXEMPTIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS
A. Exemptions: Uses in the RA-HC District are exempt from the minimum parking
requirements of this section.
B. Tree Preservation: The minimum number of parking spaces required may be
adjusted by the Administrator when it has been determined that the reductions are
necessary to preserve a healthy tree or trees (with a 12 inch or greater diameter at
breast height) from being damaged or removed, and where the site plan provides
for the retention of said tree or trees.

9-6 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
9.4.4 SATELLITE PARKING
A. If the off-street parking spaces required by this section cannot be reasonably
provided on the same lot on which the principal use is located, such space may be
provided on any land within 600 feet. Such measurement shall be taken from the
edge of the parking area on the lot to the entryway of the remote parking area.
B. Shared Satellite Parking: Upon approval by the Administrator, satellite parking
facilities may be shared by 2 or more uses which do not share normal operating
hours.
C. Parking for Permitted Uses Only: If satellite parking is utilized to fulfill parking
requirements, the owner or authorized agent for the land upon which such remote
parking is located shall restrict the use of such parking area for parking only in
connection with the use(s) or structure(s) for which such remote parking is
provided. Such restriction shall be recorded through an easements plat properly
filed with the Register of Deeds of Wake County, which may be released only by
written consent of the town. Remote parking for a particular use shall not be
established in any district that does not allow that use.
9.4.5 OFF-STREET LOADING REQUIREMENTS
A. Off-Street Loading Schedule: Off-street loading spaces shall be required for
industrial, major institutional, and business uses that can be expected to regularly
receive or deliver goods, pursuant to the following Off-Street Loading Schedule

12.1 GENERAL PURPOSE AND INTENT 12
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 12-1
Erosion, Flood, Stormwater & Watershed Standards
12.1 GENERAL PURPOSE AND INTENT
12.1.1 FINDINGS OF FACT
A. Erosion and Sedimentation Control: The erosion of soil from unstabilized
development sites has adverse impacts on the condition of public and private
property, impairs the Town of Wake Forest stormwater system, and causes
pollution and accelerated siltation of lakes, streams and other watercourses.
Pursuant to the North Carolina Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973, as
amended, the Town of Wake Forest has been directed to implement an erosion and
sedimentation control program as outlined in this chapter.
B. Flood Damage Prevention: The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the
Town of Wake Forest are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of
life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety,
and general welfare. These flood losses can be caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by
the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
C. Stormwater Management: It has been determined that development and
redevelopment can alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increases
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel
erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and sediment transport and
deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge. These changes in stormwater
runoff contribute to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations
in hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural
environment. These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper
design and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development
sites. Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (Clean Water Act)
and federal Phase II Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the
North Carolina Environmental Management Commission promulgated in response
to federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas, including the
Town of Wake Forest, to adopt stormwater controls such as those included in this
chapter.
D. Watershed Protection: The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has, in
NCGS 143-21, Watershed Protection Rules, directed local governmental units to
adopt regulations that meet or exceed the minimum requirements of NCGS 143-
214.5 and water supply watershed protection rules adopted by the State
Environmental Management Commission in order to protect the water supplies
throughout the state.
12.1.2 PURPOSE
A. Erosion and Sedimentation Control: The erosion and sedimentation control
regulations of this chapter are adopted for the purposes of regulating certain landdisturbing
activities to control accelerated erosion and sedimentation in order to
control water pollution from sedimentation, inhibit the accelerated erosion and
sedimentation of lakes and watercourses and prevent damage to public and private
property by erosion and sedimentation.

12.1 GENERAL PURPOSE AND INTENT
12-2 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
B. Flood Damage Prevention:
1. It is the purpose of this section to promote public health, safety, and general
welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions
within the flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
a. restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property
due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in
erosion, flood heights or velocities;
b. require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such
uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
c. control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
d. control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
e. prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally
divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
2. Specific objectives of the flood damage prevention provisions are as follows:
a. to protect human life and health;
b. to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
c. to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
d. to minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
e. to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities
f. to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas; and
g. to ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood
Hazard Area.
C. Stormwater Management: The purpose of this section is to protect, maintain and
enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing
minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased
post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution
associated with new development and redevelopment. This ordinance seeks to meet
its general purpose through the following specific objectives and means:
1. Establishing decision-making processes for development that protects the
integrity of watersheds and preserves the health of water resources;
2. Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment
hydrologic response in their post-development state as
practicable for the applicable design storm in order to reduce flooding, stream
bank erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream
temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic
habitats;
3. Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management
standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater
EROSION, FLOOD, STORMWATER & WATERSHED STANDARDS
12.1 GENERAL PURPOSE AND INTENT 12
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 12-3
runoff quantity and quality;
4. Establishing design and review criteria for the construction, function, and
use of structural stormwater BMPs that may be used to meet the
minimum post- development stormwater management standards;
5. Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices, such
as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation
of greenspace and other conservation areas to the maximum extent
practicable;
6. Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and
maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure
that they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately,
and pose no threat to public safety;
7. Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review,
approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, for the
inspection of approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term
maintenance.

engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in
any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
2. The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be
determined based on one of the following criteria set in priority order:
a. If Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is available from other sources, all new
construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall also
comply with all applicable provisions of this ordinance and shall be
elevated or in accordance with elevations established by the Floodplain
Administrator.
b. All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development
proposals shall provide Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data if development is
greater than 5 acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites.
Such Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference to be
utilized in implementing this ordinance.
D. Floodway and Non-Encroachment Areas: Areas designated as floodways or
non-encroachment areas are located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas. The
floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the
velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential
projectiles. The following additional provisions shall apply to all development
within such areas:
1. No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements
and other developments shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated
that:

ordinance shall be evaluated by the Administrator according to the policies,
criteria, and information, including technical specifications and standards and
the specific design criteria for each stormwater practice, in the Stormwater
Best Management Practice Manual published by the North Carolina Division
of Water Resources (hereafter referred to as NC BMP Manual). The
Administrator shall determine whether they will be adequate to meet the
requirements of this section as amended.
2. The NC BMP Manual includes a list of acceptable stormwater treatment
practices and the specific design criteria for each stormwater practice.
Stormwater treatment practices that are designed, constructed, and maintained
in accordance with the criteria and specifications in the NC BMP Manual will
be presumed to meet the minimum water quality and quantity performance
standards of this ordinance.
B. Relationship of NC BMP Manual to Other Laws and Regulations: If the
specifications or guidelines of the NC BMP Manual are more restrictive or apply a
higher standard than other laws or regulations, that fact shall not prevent
application of the specifications or guidelines in the NC BMP Manual.

b. The property owner(s) will furnish the town without cost a duly executed
good and sufficient easement, conveying to the town such perpetual rightof-
way determined by the Administrator and necessary for the installation
and maintenance of the storm drain, the form and sufficiency of such
easement to be determined by the Town Attorney. The town will not be
responsible for any shrubs, trees or structures within the right-of-way or
easement and permanent structures may not be built over the right-of-way.
c. At the time of the property owners application to the town, the storm
drain system to be installed is to be located on property on which a
residential, commercial, or industrial building has existed for a period of 60
months and the desirability or necessity for such installation is not due to a
planned expansion or modification of such existing building nor to an
expansion or modification made to such existing building within a 60
month period prior to the date of such application.
d. The installation of the storm drainage system shall extend throughout a
dedicated easement to a natural watercourse or existing storm drain or
across the entire lot in the event there is no natural water course or existing
storm drain on the property.
e. The pipe, size, alignment, grade, length, discharge point, structural
accessories (such as manholes, headwalls, catch basins, junction boxes) and
other specifications shall be as determined by the Administrator.
2. In the event the pipe to be installed does not exceed the equivalent of 48 in
diameter, the town will furnish the necessary labor and equipment or cost
thereof, to install the storm drain and the property owner(s) shall furnish all
required pipe and all materials for structural accessories as specified by the
Administrator. The town will purchase on behalf of the property owner(s) such
pipe and materials upon the property owner(s) depositing in cash the cost of
the same. The following conditions shall apply:
a. Cost for each property owner shall be determined by dividing the total cost
of materials by the total footage of property owners adjoining the
proposed pipe location and multiplying the result by the footage of each
individual owner to determine his/her share of the cost.
b. Where the size of the pipe to be installed exceeds 48 in diameter, the
town shall determine the most feasible method of improving the ditch with
methods such as, but not limited to piping, paving banks, culverts;
concrete lining, rip rap, etc.
c. In such cases where the size of the pipe exceeds 48 in diameter, the
property owner(s) share of the cost shall not exceed the cost of all
materials and accessories for the installation of a pipe 48 in diameter.
3. It shall be the policy of the town to improve sections of open ditch in sufficient
length as determined by the Administrator.
4. The storm drainage within publicly dedicated easements shall be the entire and
sole property of the town upon completion.
5. If the property owner(s) desires that the town participate in the installation of a
storm drain, such property owner(s) shall execute and deliver to the town a
written application for such participation, together with a non-refundable
application fee to cover the cost of processing the application.

6. Any construction to be done by the town under Section 12.5.7.B.2, above, of
this policy will be done on a low priority basis and shall be done on a scheduled
basis so as not to interfere with other public works projects of the town and as
budgeted funds are available. Projects will normally be budgeted in subsequent
fiscal year(s).
7. Storm drainage crossing private property which does not carry storm drainage
from an existing town street or streets dedicated for public street purposes and
accepted by the town for maintenance is the responsibility of the property
owner(s) and the town; therefore, will not participate in the installation.
C. Roadside Ditch Pipe: Once driveway or roadside ditch pipe is bought and
installed by a property owner abutting a street, the material remains the property of
the property owner. If the pipe is determined by the town to need replacing for any
reason, the town will remove the pipe from the ditch and leave it on site for the
property owner to dispose of. The abutting property owner will not be charged for
any pipe size increase nor will owner be given any credits.

UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 12-29
G. Calculation of Impervious Area: For the purpose of calculating the impervious
surface area, total project area shall include total acreage in the tract on which the
project is to be developed. Impervious surface area includes any material which
reduces and prevents absorption of storm water into previously undeveloped land
such as roads, parking lots, paths, and recreation facilities such as tennis courts.
Impervious surface area does not include wooden slatted decks, the water area of a
swimming pool, or pervious or partially pervious paving material to the extent that
the paving material absorbs water or allows water to infiltrate through the paving
material and underlying substrate. Other pervious materials may be excluded from
the calculation of impervious area as provided by the North Carolina environmental
Management Commission Manual as amended.
H. Prohibited Uses: The following uses are prohibited in the Water Supply
Watershed Protection Overlay Districts:
1. Processing of mineral products;
2. Lumber mills and saw mills;

quality of water in water supply watersheds by posing a threat of run-off,
leaching or other types of pollution.
I. Hazardous Materials
1. Existing and new industrial development shall maintain an inventory of all
hazardous materials used and stored on the premises; and, prepare a
spill/failure containment plan and implement safeguards against contamination;
and, encourage waste minimization and the appropriate recycling of materials.
2. New industrial development shall incorporate adequately designed, constructed
and maintained spill containment structures if hazardous materials are used,
stored or manufactured on the premises.
12.6.2 IMPERVIOUS SURFACE AVERAGING
A. Purpose: Impervious surface averaging allows development plans for 2
noncontiguous parcels to be submitted together and treated as a single project in
order to meet the requirements of this section. This option is intended to enhance
water supply watershed protection and provide greater development flexibility for
properties in Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay Districts by allowing the
transfer of impervious area "credits" across parcels.
B. Limitations: In order to qualify for an impervious surface averaging allowance:
1. All other requirements of this ordinance must be met;
12
EROSION, FLOOD, STORMWATER & WATERSHED STANDARDS
12.6 WATER SUPPLY WATERSHED PROTECTION REGULATIONS
12-30 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
2. The property from which the impervious area credits are taken must not have
been used in the calculation of impervious area allowance for an existing or
approved development project;
3. No parcel for which a watershed variance has been granted, or would be
required, may be included as a part of a parcel pair; and
4. The development proposal for the parcel pair shall conform to the intent and
requirements of this section, shall be consistent with the orderly and planned
distribution of development throughout the community, and shall assure
protection of the public interest.
C. Location
1. Parcels from which development credits are taken must be located in a
Watershed Protection Overlay District.
2. Parcels to which development credits are applied must be located within the
same water supply watershed as the paired-parcel.
D. Combined Impervious Surface Area Limit: The total amount of development
(impervious surface area) allowed for the paired parcels taken together cannot
exceed the amount of development that would be allowed if the parcels were
developed separately.
E. Overall Density Limit: Overall density of the paired-parcel, averaged-impervious
surface development, calculated either by dwelling units per acre or built upon area
shall not exceed the density that would be allowed if the parcels were developed
separately.
F. Runoff Volume: Peak flow must be controlled on the developing lot or project
using the acreage or area of the developing lot or project only, so as to minimize
drainage impact on downstream properties.
G. Stormwater Flow: Plans shall be designed to:
1. Minimize stormwater runoff impact to the receiving waters by minimizing
concentrated stormwater flow;
2. Maximize the use of sheet flow through vegetated areas;
3. Minimize impervious surface areas;
4. Locate development away from surface waters and drainage ways to the
maximum extent practicable; and
5. Where concentrated flow is unavoidable, convey stormwater from developed
areas by vegetated swales to the maximum extent practicable.
H. Procedure for Approval
1. An impervious surface averaging allowance shall be conveyed as part of a
Development Permit, in accordance with Section 15.6.1. Only owners of both
of the paired parcels may submit an application for a development using an
impervious surface averaging allowance.
2. Included with the Development Permit application shall be a site plan,
registered plats/sealed boundary survey for both properties, a description of
both properties, appropriate calculations and documentation of the proposed
impervious surface averaging agreement, and documentation indicating the
intent to convey the undeveloped parcel(s) or portion(s) thereof to the town.

3. If an impervious surface averaging allowance is granted as part of a
Development Permit, no change in the development proposal authorized for
either parcel shall be made unless the impervious surface averaging allowance is
amended and reapproved by the Administrator.
4. Before a Building Permit is issued, the undeveloped parcel(s) or portion(s)
thereof shall be deeded (fee simple and at no cost) to the Town of Wake Forest
and the town shall place a permanent conservation easement on the same, as
provided under NCGS 121-35, granted to the town, a land conservation
organization, or other entity capable of providing for the ongoing maintenance
of the undeveloped property. No such agreement shall be accepted without
approval of the Town Attorney as to the legal sufficiency of the documents
involved.
5. Once ownership of such land is conveyed, a plat showing the properties and
conservation easements involved in the development, and outlining the
impervious surface averaging requirements associated with the parcel pair must
be reviewed, approved, and recorded prior to the issuance of the building
permit.
I. Agreements Shall Continue Indefinitely: Applicants shall agree to bind
themselves and their successors in title, individually and collectively, to maintain the
pattern of development proposed for so long as the requirements of this section are
applicable. Parties to enforcement of such agreement shall include the town.
12.7 WATERCOURSE (RIPARIAN) BUFFER AREAS
It is the intent of this section to seek to maximize retention of the natural beauty of vegetation along
creeks, streams, rivers, and lakes, and other bodies of water while simultaneously providing for the
retention of surface water run-off from areas adjacent to these natural and/or built features, resulting in a
net reduction of pollutants that enter these water features.
12.7.1 ESTABLISHMENT OF BUFFERS
A. Applicability: All protected drainageways and surface waters shall have riparian
buffers directly adjacent to such surface waters of the width specified in 12.7.2
below. When multiple watercourse buffer standards apply, the more stringent
standard shall dictate.
B. Location of Buffers
1. For the purposes of this section, intermittent streams, perennial streams, upper
watershed drainageways that drain more than 5 acres, water supply
impoundments, lakes, ponds and wetlands shall be deemed to be present if the
feature is indicated on the most recent versions of the following:
a. United States Geological Survey 1:24,000 scale (7.5 minute quadrangle)
topographic maps;
b. A soil survey map prepared by the Natural Resources Conservation Service
of the United States Department of Agriculture;
c. The North Carolina Division of Water Resources (NCDWR) identification
methodology for determination of perennial and intermittent streams; or
d. Other site-specific evidence.
2. Wetlands may also be identified, as either a bordering or isolated wetland, using
the 1987 Corp of Engineers technique and/or supplemental Corps-approved
methodology.

13.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS
13.2.1 APPEALS AND MODIFICATIONS
A. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from any land owner (i) to
make a change in use of a nonconforming use to a different, less-intense
nonconforming use; (ii) to make a change in location of a nonconforming use of
land to another location on the same property; or (iii) allow the replacement of a
nonconforming use.
B. The Board of Adjustment may only grant a change for a nonconforming use or
replacement of a nonconforming structure which has been destroyed after having
first held a public hearing and having determined that:
1. Said change will be more suitable and appropriate for the lot(s) on which it is
located than the existing situation; and,
2. The proposed change will have a less harmful effect than the existing situation
on the properties surrounding the lot(s) in question; and,
3. The decision to grant the change will be in harmony with the general purpose
and intent of this ordinance and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or
otherwise be detrimental to the public welfare.
C. The Board of Adjustment, in granting such changes, may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this ordinance. Violation of such
conditions and safeguards when made a part of the terms upon which the change
was granted, shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance and shall be subject to
enforcement provisions a prescribed per Chapter 16, Violations and Penalties.

modification to a plan originally approved under this ordinance.
13.3.2 VESTED RIGHTS
This section does not prohibit the exercise of any vested right established by common
law ordinance or statute.
13.4 NONCONFORMING LOTS
13.4.1 DEFINITION AND APPLICABILITY
A nonconforming lot is a lot of record that does not meet the dimensional
requirements of Chapter 2 for the land development district in which it is located. A
nonconforming vacant lot of record is one that was recorded by plat or description in
the Office of the Register of Deeds of Wake County prior to the adoption of this
chapter or prior to the time that the lot was brought into the town's jurisdiction. This
definition shall not be interpreted to include recorded lots that were in violation of any
prior subdivision regulations of the Town of Wake Forest and which will remain in
violation.
13.4.2 STANDARDS
A. Lot May Be Developed: Except as provided in Sections 13.4.2.B and C below, a
nonconforming vacant lot may be developed for any of the uses permitted by these
regulations in the district in which it is located, provided that any use and/or
structure meets all applicable yard and setback requirements for the district in
which the lot is located. A variance shall not be required for substandard lot width
or lot size for such lots of record.
B. Lots to Be Combined, If Possible: A nonconforming vacant lot shall not be
developed if it can be combined with an adjoining lot owned by the same person
on or after the effective date of these regulations in order to create a single
conforming or substantially conforming lot. For the purposes of this section,
adjoining shall be deemed to mean the sharing of one or more common lot lines
and access to both lots can be provided by the same street without crossing that
street. All other minimum requirements for the particular land development district
and proposed use must be met or a variance obtained from these requirements
through an action of the Board of Adjustment. This shall include meeting the
13
NONCONFORMITIES
13.5 NONCONFORMING USES & STRUCTURES
13-4 TOWN OF WAKE FOREST, NC
requirements for additional lot size for increased densities of residential
development (duplexes, multi-family dwellings, etc.).
C. Exceptions for Previously Approved Plats: A nonconforming lot may be
developed if, at the effective date of this ordinance, the lot is located in (i) a
subdivision that had received preliminary plat approval; or (ii) a subdivision that
had received final plat approval.
D. Existing Structures on Non-Conforming Lots: Any structure on a
nonconforming occupied lot may be occupied, without expansion, by a
conforming use or may be improved or expanded in accordance with the standards
listed in this section. Structural alterations or remodeling of structures on
nonconforming lots required by an authorized public official shall be permitted.
Routine maintenance shall also be permitted so long as no expansion of the
nonconformity occurs as a result of the maintenance.
E. Expansion of Structures: Any improvement or expansion of any structure on a
nonconforming occupied lot must comply with all other minimum requirements of
this ordinance or a variance must be obtained from these requirements through an
action of the Board of Adjustment. This shall include meeting the requirements for
additional lot size for increased densities of residential development (duplexes,
multi-family dwellings, etc.).
13.5 NONCONFORMING USES & STRUCTURES
13.5.1 DEFINITION AND APPLICABILITY
A. Nonconforming Use: A nonconforming use is a use which was once a permitted
use on a parcel of land or within a structure, or which precedes any ordinances, but
which is now not a permitted use of that parcel according to Chapter 2 of this
ordinance. This definition includes open uses of land (e.g., storage yards and golf
driving ranges) as well as the structures that contain nonconforming uses. The
nonconformity may result from the adoption of this ordinance or any subsequent
amendment.
B. Nonconforming Structure: A nonconforming structure does not conform to
dimensional, design, locational, or other requirements of this ordinance. The
nonconformity may result from adoption of this ordinance or any subsequent
amendment.
13.5.2 STANDARDS FOR NONCONFORMING USES
A. Continuation: Any legally established nonconforming use may be continued
subject to the standards listed in this section. However, once a nonconforming use
is made conforming, it may not later be used for any nonconforming use or
expanded in violation of this ordinance.
B. Extension of Use: Any non-conforming structure or non-conforming use of land
or structure, shall not hereafter be enlarged or extended in any way which serves to
increase the nature of non-conformity, except where the non-conforming use is a
residential structure used exclusively for dwelling purposes, said structure is a
permitted use and the proposed addition shall conform to all zoning requirements;
and the total area of the addition shall be limited to 25% percent of the area of the
original non-conforming structure; and shall be used solely for residential purposes.
C. Discontinuance of 1 Year: A nonconforming use of a structure that is
discontinued for a continuous period of more than one year may not be
NONCONFORMITIES
13.5 NONCONFORMING USES & STRUCTURES 13

reestablished. All subsequent uses of the structure and site must be in conformance
with the particular regulations for the land development district in which the
property is located.
13.5.3 STANDARDS FOR NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
A. Continuation: Any legally established nonconforming use or structure may be
continued subject to the standards listed in this section. However, once a
nonconforming use or structure is made conforming, it may not later be used for
any nonconforming use or expanded in violation of this ordinance. Should any
non-conforming structure or use of land or structure be moved for any reason for
any distance, whatever, it shall hereafter conform to the regulations for the district
in which it is relocated.
B. Repairs and Modernization: Repairs and modernization of any nonconforming
structure are permitted provided that such repairs or modernization shall in no way
serve to augment the nature of non-conformity. Nothing in this ordinance shall be
construed so as to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any
building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any public official charged with
protecting the public safety, health and welfare pursuant to orders of such official.
C. Damage or Destruction
1. Should a non-conforming structure or non-conforming portion of a structure
be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50% of its replacement
cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
2. The above requirement does not apply to single-family dwellings and accessory
buildings or structures located in any historic district, designated as a local
landmark, or individually listed on the North Carolina study list or the
National Register of Historic Places. Structures meeting these classifications
may be reconstructed as long as such reconstruction does not increase the
nonconformity of the original structure.
D. Manufactured Homes: No Class C manufactured home shall be removed for
more than 48 hours and replaced unless its lot and stand conform to the
requirements of this ordinance.
E. Nonconforming Non-Residential Structures within a Floodway or Flood
Fringe: Nonconforming structures within a Floodway or Flood Fringe: any
nonconforming structure wholly or partly within a Special Flood Hazard Area may
be flood-proofed according to methods and specifications set for in the publication
of the Office of the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, entitled Flood-proofing
Regulations, a copy of which shall be kept on file in the Office of the Town Clerk.
13.5.4 STANDARDS FOR NONCONFORMING ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES

UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 15-3
15.2.5 COMPLETENESS REVIEW
A. Sufficiency to be Determined by Administrator: All applications shall be sufficient
for processing before the Administrator is required to review the application. An
application shall be sufficient for processing when it contains all of the information
necessary, in accordance with the appropriate development permit checklist, to decide
whether or not the development as proposed will comply with the requirements of
this ordinance. The Administrator will prepare and disseminate appropriate checklists
for use by applicants in their submission. These checklists are part of the Wake Forest
Specifications Manual and are made a part of this ordinance by reference.
B. Application Information: The presumption shall be that all of the information
required in the application forms is necessary to satisfy the requirements of this
section. However, it is recognized that each application is unique, and therefore more
or less information may be required according to the needs of the particular case.
C. Evidence of Authority: The Administrator may require an applicant to present
evidence of authority to submit the application.
D. Application Deadline: Applications sufficient for processing shall be submitted to
the Administrator in accordance with the published calendar schedule. Schedules
indicating submittal dates shall be developed each year and made available to the
public.

advertisements shall be published in separate calendar weeks. Each advertisement
shall not be less than one-half of a newspaper page in size. The advertisement shall
only be effective for property owners who reside in the area of general circulation of
the newspaper which publishes the notice. Property owners who reside outside of the
newspaper circulation area, according to the address listed on the most recent
property tax listing for the affected property, shall be notified by first class mail.
C. Posted Notice: In addition to providing mailed notice or published notice, as
required in paragraphs A and B above, a sign shall be placed in a prominent location
on the subject property(ies) or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way

5.4 APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS 15
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 15-5
5.4 APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
The following general standards for various applications have been identified as a means to create a hierarchy of
submissions for various permits and procedures. It is the expressed intent of this ordinance to limit the required
information to only that data/information that is necessary to render an informed decision by the reviewing
agency at a particular stage. In this manner, the town has determined that it is both inappropriate and unnecessary
to require a full set of architectural or engineering drawings for review by the various review and decision-making
boards unless the application is such that a specific level of detail is necessary (e.g., floodplain/stormwater
variance). The Application Checklists in the Manual of Specifications, Standards and Design are intended to
provide further guidance to applicants as to the necessary level of detail for certain permit/process types.
Permits/processes for which additional detail is included in these Application Checklists are marked with an
asterisk (*) in the table below.

15.5 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR QUASI-JUDICIAL HEARINGS AND DECISIONS
A quasi-judicial decision is a process that involves the finding of facts regarding a specific application of
an ordinance and the exercise of discretion when applying the standards of the ordinance. Quasi-judicial
decisions include decisions involving variances, special use permits, and appeals of administrative
determinations. In accordance with G.S. 160A-393, decisions on the approval of site plans and
subdivisions are quasi-judicial in nature if the ordinance authorizes a decision-making board to approve or
deny the application based on one or more generally stated standards requiring a discretionary decision on
the findings of fact to be made by the decision-making board. As a result the following standard
procedures shall be incorporated as appropriate.
15.5.1 STANDARDS FOR CONDUCT OF QUASI-JUDICIAL HEARINGS
A. Contact with Decision-Making Board Members: Contact with any members of
a decision-making board prior to the public hearing by any individual regarding the
matter is prohibited.
ADMINISTRATION
15.5 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR QUASI-JUDICIAL HEARINGS AND DECISIONS 15
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 15-9
B. Conflicts of Interest: A member of the decision-making board shall not participate
in or vote on a quasi-judicial matter in a manner that would violate affected
persons constitutional rights to an impartial decision maker. Impermissible
conflicts include, but are not limited to, a member having a fixed opinion prior to
hearing the matter that is not susceptible to change, a close familial, business, or
other associational relationship with an affected person, or a financial interest in the
outcome of the matter. If an objection is raised to a members participation and that
member does not recuse himself or herself, the remaining members shall by
majority vote rule on the objection.
C. All Participants to be Sworn In: All participants in the public hearing shall be
duly sworn in prior to the submission of any testimony.
D. Competent Evidence Required: All decisions shall be based on competent
evidence entered in as part of the record. The term "competent evidence," as used
in this subsection, shall not preclude reliance by the decision-making board on
evidence that would not be admissible under the rules of evidence as applied in the
trial division of the General Court of Justice if (i) the evidence was admitted
without objection, or (ii) the evidence appears to be sufficiently trustworthy and
was admitted under such circumstances that it was reasonable for the decisionmaking
board to rely upon it. The term "competent evidence," as used in this
subsection, shall not be deemed to include the opinion testimony of lay witnesses as
to any of the following:
1. The use of property in a particular way would affect the value of other
property.
2. The increase in vehicular traffic resulting from a proposed development would
pose a danger to the public safety.
3. Matters about which only expert testimony would generally be admissible
under the rules of evidence.
E. Cross-Examination Permitted: The cross-examination of witnesses submitting
testimony shall be permitted upon request.
15.5.2 STANDARDS FOR DECISIONS
Each decision-making board under the provisions of this section shall ensure that the
rights of petitioners have not been prejudiced because of the decision-making body's
findings, inferences, or conclusions. In addition such decision shall not be:
A. In violation of constitutional provisions, including those protecting procedural due
process rights.
B. In excess of the statutory authority conferred upon the town or the authority
conferred upon the decision-making board by ordinance.
C. Inconsistent with applicable procedures specified by statute or ordinance.
D. Affected by other error of law.
E. Unsupported by substantial competent and material evidence in view of the entire
record.
F. Arbitrary and capricious.
15.5.3 RECORD OF DECISION
A. The following shall become part of the official record of decision:

H. Public Hearing: The HPC shall hold a hearing on the proposal. The applicant and
other property owners likely to be materially affected by the application shall be
given an opportunity to be heard.
I. HPC Review  Locally Designated Historic Structures: An application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness authorizing the demolition, removal or destruction
of a locally designated historic structure, as outlined in Section 15.11.4.A.1 above,
may not be denied or delayed except as provided below:
1. The effective date of such a certificate may be delayed for up to 365 days from
the date of approval. The period of delay should be reduced by the HPC if it
finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently
deprived of all beneficial use or return from such property by virtue of the
delay.
2. During the delay period the HPC shall negotiate with the owner in an effort to
find a means of preserving the building, structure or site.
3. If the HPC finds that a building, structure or site has no special significance or
value toward maintaining the character of a district, it shall waive all or part of
such period of delay and authorize earlier demolition or removal.
4. If the HPC has voted to recommend the designation of a landmark or the
designation of an area as a historic district, and final designation has not been

DASS Tier Criteria for Assignment of Tier Category* Required Action
Tier 1
? Appears on the Historic Building
Survey Map of the town; OR
? Located in an area on the state study
list as a potential historic district
Staff shall determine if property is located in an area
that is a potential historic district or if the property is a
potential for listing on the state study list. If either is
true an application for a COA shall be filed by the
applicant for review by the HPC. The HPC shall grant
a COA authorizing demolition or may order a delay of
up to 365 days before demolition may commence. If
neither is true (i.e. the site is not in a potential historic
district and is not a potential for listing on the state
study list) no COA is required and the demolition may
proceed without delay.
Tier 2
? Certified or preliminarily determined by
the Secretary of the Interior as
contributing to the significance of a
district preliminarily determined by the
Secretary to qualify as a registered
historic district; OR
? Designated as non-contributing in a
National Register historic district; OR
? Individually listed in the state study list;
OR
? Individually listed in any county or local
inventory of historic buildings or sites

An application for a COA shall be filed by the
applicant for review by the HPC. The HPC shall grant
a COA authorizing demolition or may order a delay of
up to 365 days before demolition may commence. (A
Tier 3 DASS score will likely result in an automatic
delay of 365 days.)
None ? None of the above criteria apply. No delay of demolition. No COA required.

building, structure or site in the proposed district or of the designated landmark
may be delayed by the commission for up to 365 days after the Board of
Commissioners takes final action on the designation.
5. An application for a Major Certificate of Appropriateness authorizing the
demolition of a building, structure or site determined by the State of North
Carolinas Historic Preservation Officer as having statewide significance as
defined in the criteria of the National Register of Historic Places may be denied
except where the HPC finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or
be permanently deprived of all beneficial use or return by virtue of the denial.
J. HPC Review  Other Historic Structures: An application for a COA authorizing
the demolition, removal or destruction of other historic structures as outlined in
Section 15.11.4.A.2 above, shall be evaluated by the HPC based on 4 standards
which will be weighed using a point scale of 0 to 2, where 0 means that the
structure does not meet the standard, 1 means the structure moderately meets the
standard, and 2 means the structure significantly meets the standard. A total score
of 4 or greater will result issuance of a COA with an order for delay of demolition
for 365 days from the date in the COA. A total score of less than 4 may result in the
issuance of a COA with a delay of less than 365 days or no delay of demolition. The
standards are as follows:
1. Architectural Integrity
a. The structure has maintained the integrity of its original architectural form.
b. Changes made to the structure over 50 years ago have gained historic
significance.
2. Architectural Style
a. The structure has a distinctive architectural style.
b. It has superior craftsmanship.
c. The structure is the last or oldest example of a certain building type.
d. It is one of a cluster of buildings that are significant as a group.
3. Cultural Significance: The structure is culturally significant due to factors
such as its historic use, an event, a person, a builder, or an architect associated
with the structure.
4. Structural Integrity
a. The structure will be given a score of 2 points for structural integrity unless
the applicant has provided an engineers report stating otherwise.
b. Said report will be paid for by the applicant using a structural engineer
recommended by the SHPO.
c. The structural components  roof, wall, floor, and foundation systems will
each have a value of ½ point.
d. If the report states that a system is structurally unsound the score of 2 will
be reduced by ½ point per system rated at 50% or more unsound.
K. HPC Decision and Findings of Fact: The action on an application must be
supported by specific findings of fact indicating the extent to which the application
meets the provisions above. The HPC may choose to include previous documented
time spent in the search for an alternative to demolition, such as moving the
structure, as part of any required delay of demolition.

mutual consent of the HPC and the applicant.
M. Immediate Demolition  Other Historic Structures: For applications regarding
other historic structures as outlined in Section 15.11.4.A.2 above, the applicant
may avoid a delay in demolition imposed by the HPC if the State Building Inspector
orders the immediate demolition of the structure, or if the applicant makes a claim
of unsafe conditions according to the following provisions.
1. Any application for demolition of a Tier 2 or 3 structure must include
documentation as to the condition of the property to support a claim of unsafe
conditions.
2. This documentation shall be in the form of a report from a structural engineer
recommended by the SHPO and paid for by the applicant. This report shall
specifically address the roof, wall, floor, and foundation systems rated as a
percentage structurally unsound.
3. If the structure to be demolished is an accessory structure, a similar report from
the town building inspector may be submitted for the engineers report
although the HPC may require that the applicant return with an engineers
report at the applicants expense.
4. The HPC may also require an engineers report for any Tier 1 property at their
discretion and at the applicants expense based on the considerations of the
specific site.
5. A structure found to be unsafe shall not automatically be issued a COA with no
delay of demolition. The COA may be issued with a delay of demolition and an
order for stabilization or shoring in order to avoid demolition by neglect.
N. Salvage of Materials  Other Historic Structures: For applications regarding
other historic structures as outlined in Section 15.11.4.A.2 above, the applicant
shall make all materials available to salvagers prior to demolition according to the
provisions below.

salvage is handled in another acceptable manner or the potential salvage is of
minimal value.
3. The applicant shall time the collection of materials in a logical manner, such as
doors, windows, fireplace surrounds and mantels, cabinets, fixtures, etc will be
collected prior to wood flooring, although carpets could be collected early.
4. At the time the salvaged materials are collected the applicant or his agent must
be on site to assure that materials are not damaged in the acquisition of other
materials.

solely to remove inconveniences or financial burdens that the requirements of this
ordinance may impose on property owners in general or to increase the profitability
of a proposed development, although such factors can be taken into consideration.
C. Use Variances Not Permitted: In no event shall the Board of Adjustment grant a
variance which would allow the establishment of a use which is not otherwise
allowed in a land development district or which would change the land
development district classification or the district boundary of the property in
question.

property or by an agent specifically authorized by the owner to file such application.
D. Required Application Information: All information relevant to describing the
applicants request to the Board of Adjustment.
E. Public Notification: Level 1, 2 & 4 required.
F. Determination of Compliance: Staff shall review an application for a variance to
determine if it is complete. If an application is complete, the Administrator shall

Administrator shall prepare a staff report regarding the submitted variance
application.
15.13.3 FORMAL REVIEW
A. Action by the Board of Adjustment
1. Upon receipt of the request for a variance from the Administrator, the Board
of Adjustment shall hold a quasi-judicial hearing on the request.
2. After conducting the hearing, the Board of Adjustment may: deny the
application; conduct an additional public hearing on the application; approve
the application; or approve the application with additional conditions. A
concurring vote of four-fifths of the members of the Board of Adjustment
shall be necessary to grant a variance.
3. A decision by the Board of Adjustment shall be made within 45 days of the
date of the hearing.
4. Any approval or denial of the request shall be accompanied by written findings
of fact supporting the conclusion that the variance meets or does not meet
each of the standards set forth below.
B. Standard of Review: The Board of Adjustment shall not grant a variance unless
and until it makes all of the following findings:
1. Carrying out the strict letter of the ordinance would result in an unnecessary
hardship. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the
variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
2. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as
location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal
circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common
to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a
variance.
3. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant of the property
owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances
exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a selfcreated
hardship.
4. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of this
ordinance, such that the public safety is secured, and substantial justice is
achieved.
C. Additional Standards for Floodplain, Watershed and Stormwater Regulation
Variance Requests: Variances from the standards set forth in this ordinance for
flood damage prevention, watershed protection and stormwater regulation may be
granted subject to the following additional provisions:
ADMINISTRATION
15.13 VARIANCES 15
UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE | Adopted July 16, 2013 15-43
1. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in
flood levels during the base flood discharge would result or when the variance
will make the structure in violation of other federal, state or local laws.
2. Variances shall only be issued upon:
a. A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering
the flood hazard, to afford relief;
b. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
c. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship; and,
d. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in a
substantial increase in flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
3. In passing upon variances, the Board of Adjustment shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this
chapter and:
a. The danger that material may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others.
b. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
c. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage
and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
d. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community.
e. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion
damage, for the proposed use.
f. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
g. The relationship of the proposed use to the land development plan and
flood damage prevention program for that area.
h. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
i. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site.
j. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
4. Any applicant to whom a variance from the floodplain development regulations
is granted shall be given written notice. This notice shall specify the difference
between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to
be built and contain a written statement that such construction below the Base

public hearing. Written notice of such public hearing shall be mailed by first class
mail to the owner, and any other responsible person with legal control of the

application for a COA be submitted for repairs requiring a separate hearing before
the HPC. Any required time limit for repairs will automatically be adjusted, as
needed, to allow the normal COA process.

state of demolition by neglect exists, a Notice of Violation will be sent to the
property owner, according to standard town procedures. If an order to submit an
application for a COA has been issued by the HPC the Notice of Violation will
include a statement to that fact and the time allowed for compliance will be
appropriately adjusted.

neglect finding has occurred. In the event that any of the required information
is not reasonably available to the owner and/or parties in interest and/or
cannot be obtained by the owner, the owner shall describe the reasons why
such information cannot be obtained. The minimum necessary evidence shall
include, but is not limited to:

Preservation Commission. In the event of a finding of no undue economic
hardship, the Administrator shall cause to be issued an order for such property
to be repaired within the time specified.
5. In the event of a finding of undue economic hardship, the finding may be
accompanied by a recommended plan to relieve the economic hardship. This
plan may include, but is not limited to the following: property tax relief as may
be allowed under North Carolina law, loans or grants from the city, the county,
or other public, private, or nonprofit sources, acquisition by purchase, building
code modifications, changes in applicable zoning regulations, or obtaining a

Hardship Review Committee shall report such finding and the recommended
plan to the Administrator who will then cause to be issued an order for such
property to be repaired within the time specified, and according to the
provisions of the recommended plan.
