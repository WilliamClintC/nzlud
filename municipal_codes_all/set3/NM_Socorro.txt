The Independent Review Officer is hereby established (as an independent contractor of the City) and
shall be a practicing attorney in the State of New Mexico.
Powers and duties.
The IRO shall be given autonomy and shall perform all duties under the direction of the POC.
The IRO shall not serve as legal advisor to the City and therefore there will be no attorneyclient
privilege between the IRO and the City.
The IRO will receive all citizen police complaints (CPC) directed against the Socorro Police
Department and any of its officers. The IRO will review such complaints and assign them for
investigation to either the Socorro Police Department (Assistant Chief) for an internal

and review all such investigations and make findings for each. All findings relating to citizen
complaints, including police shootings and use of TASERs, will be forwarded to the POC. The
IRO may review completed internal affairs (IA) cases and discuss those cases with the Chief
or his designee. In all cases, the Chief of Police shall have the sole authority and
responsibility for discipline. For all investigations, the IRO will make recommendations and
give opinions regarding adherence to Departmental policies and procedures to the POC, City
Council and the Mayor as the IRO deems advisable, provided as follows:
That investigation of all citizen complaints filed with the IRO shall begin immediately after
complaints are filed and proceed as expeditiously as possible;
That all citizen police complaints filed with other offices within the City authorized to
accept citizen complaints (Mayor's Office, City Clerk's Office, Finance Director's Office),
including the Police Department, shall be referred to the IRO for investigation;
That, at the discretion of the IRO, an impartial system of mediation may be considered
appropriate for certain complaints. If all parties involved reach an agreement, the
mediation is considered successful, no investigation will occur and the complaint will be
deemed complete;
That all investigations shall be thorough, objective, fair, impartial and free from political
influence;
That all information necessary to satisfy the POC's quarterly reporting requirements in
§ 12-17 of this article be maintained and compiled;
That the process for finalizing findings on police shooting cases, tasings and written
claims of excessive force shall be the same as the process for finalizing findings on
citizen police complaints.
The IRO shall monitor all police shootings, tasings and claims of excessive force;
The IRO shall have access to any nonprivileged Police Department information or documents
that are relevant to a citizen's complaint or to an issue which is ongoing at the POC.
The IRO may make recommendations (in writing) to the POC and SPD on specific training,
changes in policy or duty manuals. SPD will respond, in writing, to all recommendations from
the IRO or POC within 60 days. The IRO shall follow up and monitor all recommendations to
verify their adoption and implementation.
The IRO shall request that the City provides staff assistance for the POC (as herein defined)
and coordinates and provides technical support for all scheduled POC meetings, publicize (as
appropriate) all findings and reports and/or suggested policy changes.

appropriate outreach to the community. The IRO shall publicize the citizen complaint process

non-police environment.
Qualifications and selection.
Qualifications for the position of Independent Review Officer shall be determined by the POC.
The qualifications minimally include the requirement of a law degree, experience in criminal
investigations and a practicing attorney in New Mexico.
Selection.
The initial IRO will be selected by the governing body through the City's regular
RFQ/RFP process.
Thereafter, the IRO will be selected as follows:
A candidate search will be undertaken by the POC, which will screen, interview and
select three candidates to be considered by the Mayor.
The Mayor will select one of the three candidates and forward his recommendation
to the City Council.
The City Council may accept or reject the Mayor's nominee.
In the event the City Council rejects the nominee, the Mayor shall submit his second
recommendation from the names submitted by the POC. The City Council may
accept or reject the Mayor's nominee.
In the event that the City Council rejects the second nominee, the process shall
begin with a second candidate search by the POC.
The position of IRO will be a contractual position.
The IRO will provide the necessary professional and/or clerical staff to carry out his duties
and shall prescribe the duties of these staff members in the contract with the City. Such
professional and clerical staff will be identified and agreed to in the IRO's contract with the
City.
The IRO will report directly to the POC and will act as lead investigator and manager of all
complaints; will supervise all investigations of citizen complaints against police officers; will
audit all investigations of complaints and/or police shootings, excessive force and tasings; will
recommend and participate in mediation of certain complaints.
The term of the IRO shall be for two years, commencing immediately upon approval by the
City Council. The Mayor, with the approval of the City Council, shall have the option to renew
or extend the contract with the IRO for additional two-year periods. Negotiations to renew or
extend the contract shall be completed three months prior to the contract expiring. Should the
contract not be renewed or extended, the IRO may, with the approval of the City Council,
continue to serve in the same capacity until a new IRO is selected and approved by the City
Council. If the IRO or the Mayor chooses not to renew or extend the contract, the POC shall
be immediately notified. The POC will then immediately begin a candidate search, as
described in Subsection B(2) above. If for some unforeseen reason there is a period of time
during which there is no IRO, the Mayor may appoint a temporary IRO with the consent and
approval of the City Council. A temporary IRO shall only serve in that capacity for a period not
to exceed six months and shall meet all qualifications of the regular IRO position.

Any person claiming to be aggrieved by actions of the Police Department may file a written
complaint against the Department or any of its officers. The POC shall submit rules and
regulations governing citizen complaint procedures to the Mayor and City Council for approval,
including rules and regulations relative to time limits, notice and other measures to ensure
impartial review of citizen's complaints against members of the Police Department.
The Mayor shall designate civilian City staff to receive written citizen complaints at various
locations throughout the City. The Mayor's office, the City Clerk's office, the City Finance Director's
office and the Police Department may also receive written complaints. Such complaints shall be
filed no later than 30 days after the occurrence of the action complained of. The party who
receives the complaint shall transmit all citizen complaints for further investigation to the IRO. If a
citizen complaint is determined to not merit further investigation (by the IRO), the complainant
shall be notified of the reasons for that determination by certified mail. The POC shall also be
notified of the IRO's decision.
After the IRO's investigation is completed, the IRO and the Chief of Police, or his designee, shall
consider the investigation and all other relevant and material evidence offered by the person
investigated. The IRO and Chief may confer and discuss the investigation and findings. The IRO
shall then submit his findings, together with the Chief's position, and draft public record letter to
the POC for review and approval. The draft public record letter to the citizen will only be sent after
approval by the POC. Approval by the POC shall be based on thoroughness and form only.
Approval by the POC does not constitute an opinion on or concurrence with the content.
If the Chief, or his designee, and the IRO disagree on the IRO's findings, the POC will receive the
IRO's findings along with the Chief's position for approval (as described in Subsection C above) at
the next regularly scheduled meeting. The POC will treat the findings as a nonconcurrence issue
and the matter will be left to the complainant to file a request for final commentary with the POC.
During final commentary, the complainant may provide an alternate position which will be become
part of the permanent record. A request for final commentary as described above must be filed 15
business days after mailing of the public record letter by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The findings of the IRO, the position of the Chief and the complainant's position provided in final
commentary shall be referred to on the Internal Affairs Unit Disciplinary Status Sheet. The form
will be filed in the CPC complaint file and the Officer's Retention File.
The Chief shall take whatever action deemed necessary, including disciplinary action, to complete
the disposition of the complaint in accordance with the SOP and City Personnel Manual.
If the Chief, or his designee, and the IRO agree on the IRO's findings, the POC will receive the
concurred-upon findings of the IRO and Chief for approval (as described in Subsection C above)
at the next regularly scheduled meeting. The POC will treat the complaint as a concurrence
(between the IRO and Chief) and the matter will be left to the complainant to file a request for final
commentary should he disagree with the Chief's/IRO's concurrent findings.
If the Chief, or his designee, and the IRO disagree on the IRO's findings, the POC will receive the
nonconcurrent findings of the IRO and Chief for approval (as described in Subsection C above) at
the next regularly scheduled meeting. The POC will treat the complaint as nonconcurrent
(between the IRO and Chief) and the matter will be left to the complainant to file a request for final
commentary should he disagree with the Chief's/IRO's nonconcurrent findings.
§ 12-16. Final commentary.
Any person who has filed a citizen complaint and who is dissatisfied with either the concurrent or
nonconcurrent findings of the IRO/Police Chief may present a final commentary (appeal/motion)
by notifying the POC within 15 business days of mailing of the public record letter by certified mail,

hearing, may terminate assistance to the economic development project by provisions set forth in
the agreement which terminate the agreement and specify the disposition of all assets and
obligations of the project.
The City shall retain a security interest, which shall be specific in the project participation
agreement. The type of security given shall depend upon the nature of economic development
project and assistance provided by the City. Types of security may include but are not limited to:

the right to deny any and all assignments, sales, leases or transfers of any interests in the
economic development project until adequate assurances are made that the transferee, assignee
or lessee is a qualifying entity and that the terms of the agreement will be satisfied by the
transferee, assignee or lessee. At its discretion, the City may choose to deny said assignment,
lease or transfer or may negotiate a new agreement with the new operator, or the City may reclaim
the facility and enter into an agreement with the new qualifying entity.
§ 23-11. Project participation agreement.
The qualifying entity shall prepare with the City a project participation agreement. This agreement
is the formal document which states the contribution and obligation of all parties in the economic
development project. The agreement must state the following items:

The contribution of the City and the qualifying entity;
The specific measurable objectives upon which the performance review will be read;
A schedule for project development and goal attainment;
The security being offered for the City's investment;
The procedures by which a project may be terminated and the City's investment recovered;

Each project participation agreement shall be subject to review and approval by the governing
body at a public hearing.

All project monies shall be kept in a separate account by the entity and the City, with such account
clearly identified. These accounts shall be subject to an annual independent audit.
§ 23-13. Joint regional projects.
The City may engage in economic development projects involving one or more other government
entities for projects which encompass more than one municipality or county. In such instances, the

Editor's Note: See NMSA § 10-8-1 et seq.
§ 44-8. Board powers and duties.
The Board shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to accomplish and perform its
functions and duties as established in this chapter, including the establishment of procedures for:
The designation of appropriate bargaining units;
The selection, certification and decertification of exclusive representatives; and
The filing, hearing and determination of complaints of prohibited practices. This does not
apply to negotiation impasses or grievances subject to the required negotiated grievance
process.
The Board shall:
Hold hearings and make inquiries necessary to carry out its functions and duties; and
Request from employers and labor organizations the information and data necessary to carry
out the functions and responsibilities of the Board.
The Board may issue subpoenas requiring, upon reasonable notice, the attendance and testimony
of witnesses and the production of any evidence, including books, records, correspondence or
documents relevant to the matter in question. The Board may prescribe the form of the subpoena
but it shall adhere insofar as practicable to the form used in civil actions in the District Court. The
Board may administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses and receive evidence. Subject
to the approval of funds, the Board may contract with a third party to assist it in carrying out its
functions.

written orders and opinions. The decisions of the Board on interpretation and applications of this
chapter are final and binding on the parties, subject to the appeal process provided in § 44-20.

The Board shall have no power to promulgate policy other than for its own operation.
No rule or regulation promulgated by the Board shall require, directly or indirectly, as a condition of
continuous employment, any employee covered by this chapter to pay money to any labor
organization that is certified as an exclusive representative. This issue of "fair share" shall be a
permissive, as opposed to a mandatory, subject of bargaining between the employer and the
exclusive representative.
§ 44-9. Hearing procedures.
The Board may hold hearings for the purposes of:
Information gathering and inquiry;
Adopting rules and regulations; and
Adjudicating disputes and enforcing the provisions of this chapter and rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to this chapter.
The Board shall adopt regulations setting forth procedures to be followed during hearings of the
Board. Such regulations shall meet minimal due process requirements of the State and Federal
Constitutions.
Proceedings against the party alleged to have committed a prohibited practice shall be
commenced by service upon it and the Board of a written notice, together with a copy of the
charges and relief requested.
All adopted rules and regulations shall be filed in accordance with applicable laws.
A verbatim record made by electronic or other suitable means shall be made of every rule-making
and adjudicatory hearing. The record shall not be transcribed unless required for judicial review or
unless ordered by the Board. The party requesting the transcript shall pay for the transcription; in
the case of judicial review, the payment shall be made by the party filing the appeal.
Each party to a prohibited labor practice shall bear the cost of producing its own witnesses and
paying its representative for hearings under this chapter.
No regulation proposed to be adopted by the Board that affects any person or governmental entity
outside of the Board and its staff shall be adopted, amended or repealed without public hearing
and comment on the proposed action before the Board. The public hearing shall be held after
notice of the subject matter of the regulation, the action proposed to be taken, the time and place
of the hearing, the manner in which interested persons may present their views and the method in
which copies of the proposed regulation, proposed amendment or repeal of an existing regulation
may be obtained. All meetings shall be held at a City facility. Notice shall be published once at
least 30 days prior to the hearing date in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Socorro,
and notice shall be mailed at least 30 days prior to the hearing date to all persons who have made
a written request for advance notice of hearings.
§ 44-10. Appropriate bargaining units.
The Board shall, upon receipt of a petition for a representation election filed by a labor
organization, designate the appropriate bargaining unit. Appropriate bargaining units shall be
established on the basis of occupational groups or clear and identifiable communities of interest in
employment terms, employment conditions and related personnel matters among the employees
involved. Occupational groups shall generally be identified as blue collar, secretarial clerical,
technical, paraprofessional, professional, corrections, firefighters and police officers. Department,

craft or trade designations other than as specified above shall not determine bargaining units. The
parties, by mutual agreement and approval of the Board, may further consolidate occupational
groups. The essential factors in determining appropriate bargaining units shall include the
principles of efficient administration of government, the history of collective bargaining and the
assurance to employees of their rights guaranteed by this chapter.
If the labor organization and the employer cannot agree on the appropriate bargaining unit within
30 days, the Board shall hold a hearing concerning the composition of the bargaining unit. Any
agreement as to the appropriate bargaining unit between the employer and the labor organization
is subject to the approval of the Board.
The Board shall not include in any appropriate bargaining unit probationary, supervisory,
managerial or confidential employees.
§ 44-11. Representation elections.
Whenever, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Board, a petition is filed by a labor
organization containing the signatures of at least 30% of the employees in an appropriate
bargaining unit, the Board shall post a notice to affected employees regarding the filed petition and
proceed with the process for conducting a secret ballot representation election.
Once a labor organization has filed a petition with the Board requesting a representation election,
other labor organizations may seek to be placed on the ballot. Any labor organization may file a
competing petition containing the signatures of not less than 30% of the employees in the
appropriate bargaining unit no later than 10 calendar days after the Board has posted a written
notice that a petition for a representation election has been filed by a labor organization.
All representation elections shall include the option for "no representation," except in a run-off
election where the choice of "no representation" was not one of the two choices that received the
highest votes.
In the event of an election with two or more labor organizations on the ballot and none of the
choices on the ballot received a majority of the votes cast, then a run-off election shall be held
within 15 calendar days. The choices on the run-off election shall consist of the two choices which
received the greatest number of votes in the original election.
A valid election requires that at least 40% of the eligible employees in an appropriate bargaining
unit cast a vote. In an election with only one labor organization and the majority of the votes cast
are in favor of representation, the Board shall certify that labor organization as the exclusive
representative for all the employees in the bargaining unit.
No election shall be conducted if an election has been conducted in the twelve-month period
immediately preceding the proposed representation election. No election shall be held during the
term of an existing collective bargaining agreement, except as provided in § 44-13B of this chapter
or after the expiration of the third year of a collective bargaining agreement with a term of more
than three years.
Election disputes shall be resolved by the Board.
As an alternative to the provisions of Subsection A of this section, the employer and a labor
organization with a reasonable basis for claiming to represent a majority of the employees in an
appropriate bargaining unit may establish an alternative appropriate procedure for determining
majority status. The procedure may include a labor organization's submission of authorization
cards from a majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit. The local board shall not
certify an appropriate bargaining unit if the employer objects to the certification without an election.

§ 44-12. Exclusive representation.
A labor organization that has been certified by the Board as the exclusive representative for employees
in an appropriate bargaining unit shall represent all employees in the bargaining unit. The exclusive
representative shall act for all employees in the bargaining unit and negotiate a collective bargaining
agreement covering all employees in the bargaining unit. The exclusive representative shall represent
the interests of all employees in the bargaining unit without discrimination or regard to membership or
nonmembership in the labor organization. The existence of an exclusive bargaining representative
shall not prevent employees from taking their grievances through the grievance process or filing
prohibited practices with the Board. No settlement of a grievance or relief given on a prohibited
practice brought by an individual shall be inconsistent with or in violation of the collective bargaining
agreement in effect between the employer and the exclusive representative or inconsistent with or in
violation of a memorandum of understanding between the employer and the exclusive representative
applicable to the day-to-day administration of the collective bargaining agreement. The exclusive
representative shall be afforded the opportunity to be present at such hearings and make its views
known.
§ 44-13. Decertification of exclusive representative.
Any member of a labor organization or the labor organization itself may initiate decertification of a
labor organization as the exclusive representative if 30% of the employees in the appropriate
bargaining unit make a written request to the Board for a decertification election. A decertification
election shall be valid only if at least 40% of the eligible employees in the bargaining unit vote in
the election.
When there is a collective bargaining agreement in effect, a request for a decertification election
shall be made to the Board no earlier than 90 days and no later than 60 days before the expiration
of the collective bargaining agreement; provided, however, that a request for a decertification
election may be filed at any time after the expiration of the third year of a collective bargaining
agreement with a term of more than three years.
When, within the time period prescribed in Subsection B of this section, a competing labor
organization files a petition containing signatures of at least 30% of the employees in the
appropriate bargaining unit, a representation election rather than a decertification election shall be
conducted.
When an exclusive representative has been certified but no collective bargaining agreement is in
effect, the Board shall not accept a request for a decertification election earlier than 12 months
subsequent to a labor organization's certification as the exclusive representative.
§ 44-14. Scope of bargaining.
Except for retirement programs provided under the Public Employees Retirement Act,[1] the
parties shall bargain in good faith on all wages, hours and other terms and conditions of
employment and other issues agreed to by the parties. The parties shall enter into a written
agreement covering employment relations regarding the issues agreed to in collective bargaining.
Editor's Note: See NMSA 1978, § 10-11-1 et seq.
Bargaining in good faith shall not require either party to agree to a proposal or to make a
concession.
The obligation to bargain collectively imposed by the labor-management relations ordinances shall
not be construed as authorizing employers and exclusive representatives to enter into any
agreement that is in conflict with state statutes or federal statutes. In the event of conflict between

the provisions of any federal or state statutes and any agreement entered into by the employer
and the exclusive representative, the former shall prevail.
Payroll deduction of the exclusive representative's membership dues shall be a mandatory subject
of bargaining if either party chooses to negotiate the issue. The amount of dues shall be certified
in writing by an official of the labor organization and shall not include special assessments,
penalties or fines of any type levied by the exclusive representative. During the time that a Board
certification is in effect for a particular exclusive representative, the employer shall not deduct
dues for any other labor organization from members of the same bargaining unit.
Any agreement or impasse resolution by the employer and an exclusive representative that
requires the expenditure of funds shall be contingent upon the specific appropriation of funds by
the governing body and the availability of funds to fund the agreed-upon provision. An arbitrator's
decision shall not require the reappropriation of funds.
The parties have a requirement that a grievance procedure culminating with final and binding
arbitration be negotiated. This applies only to grievances and the interpretation and application of
the agreement between the parties and does not apply to negotiation impasses. The parties shall
share the cost of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this subsection equally. Each party is
responsible for paying any cost related to its witnesses and representation.
§ 44-15. Negotiations and impasse resolution.
The following meetings shall be closed:
Meetings for the discussion of collective bargaining strategy between the governing body and
the employer's negotiating team preliminary to negotiations sessions;
Collective bargaining sessions; and
Consultations and impasse resolution procedures at which the employer and/or the exclusive
representative of the appropriate bargaining unit are present.
The following negotiation procedures shall apply to the employer and exclusive representatives:
The negotiations for the first contract shall be opened upon written notice by either party to
the other requesting that negotiating sessions be scheduled. Subsequent requests for
negotiations shall be postmarked no earlier than 120 days nor later than 60 days prior to the
contract ending date or as negotiated by the parties. The parties may open negotiations at
any time by mutual agreement.
All negotiations will be conducted in closed sessions. Negotiations will be held at a facility and
at a time mutually agreed upon by the parties.
Recesses and study sessions may be called by either team. Prior to the conclusion of any
negotiating sessions, the reconvening time will be agreed upon. Caucuses may be taken as
needed.
Tentative agreements reached during negotiations will be reduced to writing, dated and
initialed by each team spokesperson. Such tentative agreements are conditional and may be
withdrawn should later discussion change either party's understanding of the language as it
relates to another part of the agreement.
Agreement on contract negotiations is accomplished when the Union President and the City
Clerk sign the agreement. Provisions in multiyear agreements providing for economic
increases for subsequent years shall be contingent upon the governing body appropriating
the funds necessary to fund the increase for the subsequent year(s). Should the governing

body not appropriate sufficient funds to fund the agreed-upon increase, either party may
reopen negotiations.
The following impasse procedure shall be followed by the employer and exclusive representative:
If an impasse occurs, either party shall request mediation assistance. If the parties cannot
agree on a mediator, either party may request the assistance of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service.
If the impasse continues after 30 calendar days, either party may request an unrestricted list
of seven arbitrators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The parties shall
choose one arbitrator by alternately striking names from such list. Which party strikes the first
name shall be determined by coin toss. The arbitrator shall render a final, binding, written
decision resolving unresolved issues no later than 30 calendar days after the arbitrator has
been notified of his or her selection by the parties. The arbitrator's decision shall be limited to
a selection of one of the two parties' complete, last, best offer. However, an impasse
resolution decision of an arbitrator or an agreement provision by the employer and an
exclusive representative that requires the expenditure of funds shall be contingent upon the
specific appropriation of funds by the governing body and the availability of funds. An
arbitrator's decision shall not require the employer to reappropriate funds. The parties shall
share all of the arbitrator's costs incurred pursuant to this subsection equally. Each party shall
be responsible for paying any costs related to its witnesses and representation. The decision
shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to the standards set forth in the Uniform Arbitration
Act.[1]
Editor's Note: See NMSA 1978, § 44-7A-1 et seq.
In the event that an impasse continues after the expiration of a contract, the existing contract
will continue in full force and effect until it is replaced by a subsequent written agreement.
However, this shall not require the employer to increase any employees' levels, steps or
grades of compensation contained in the existing contract.
§ 44-16. Employer prohibited practices.
A public employer or its representatives shall not:
Discriminate against an employee with regard to terms and conditions of employment
because of the employee's membership in a labor organization;
Interfere with, restrain or coerce any employee in the exercise of any right guaranteed under
this chapter;
Dominate or interfere in the formation, existence or administration of any labor organization;
Discriminate in regard to hiring, or any term or condition of employment, in order to encourage
or discourage membership in a labor organization;

or filed an affidavit, petition, grievance or complaint or given any information or testimony
under the provisions of this chapter or because an employee is forming, joining or choosing to
be represented by a labor organization;
Refuse to bargain collectively in good faith with the exclusive representative;
Refuse or fail to comply with any provisions of this chapter, Board regulations or the Public
Employee Bargaining Act;[1] or

with anyone other than the appointed City negotiating team. It is the intent of this language that
the integrity of the negotiating process be maintained. All negotiations and concessions shall
occur only between the respective appointed negotiating teams.
§ 44-18. Strikes and lockouts prohibited.
No employee or labor organization shall engage in a strike. No labor organization shall cause,
instigate, encourage or support a strike. The employer shall not cause, instigate or engage in an
employee lockout.
The employer may apply to the District Court for injunctive relief to end a strike, and an exclusive
representative of public employees affected by a lockout may apply to the District Court for
injunctive relief to end a lockout.
The Board, upon a clear and convincing showing of proof at a hearing that a labor organization
directly caused or instigated an employee strike, may impose appropriate penalties on that labor
organization, up to and including decertification of the labor organization with respect to any of its
bargaining units which struck as a result of such causation or instigation.[1]

All nonelective positions in the service of the City of Socorro are covered under the provisions of
this chapter and the rules promulgated hereunder, except the following:
The City Attorney.
All members of boards and commissions appointed by the Mayor.
Professional consultants.
Temporary employees employed for a period of less than six months.
Employees who work less than 20 hours a week.
Probationary employees.
Within 10 days following the adoption of this chapter, an employee in a position covered by this
chapter may file with the Clerk a declaration stating that the employee does not desire to have his
employment subject to this chapter and the rules and regulations issued pursuant to this chapter.
Thereafter, all positions, except those specifically excluded, shall be covered.
Persons employed after the effective date of this chapter and not as temporary or part-time
employees shall serve a probationary period of not exceeding one year, but not less than six
months, prior to being covered by this chapter; provided, however, that such employee may
sooner be covered by this chapter if the head of his department sooner recommends such
employee to the Mayor to be a permanent employee. Employees who have been employed by the
City of Socorro for the last six months continuously, on the effective date of this chapter, shall be
considered permanent employees. Such employees not having six months' employment on the
effective date of this chapter shall serve a six-month probationary period from time of initial
employment before being considered permanent employees. City Council confirmation shall be
required prior to an employee attaining status as a permanent employee.
§ 63-6. Employee grievances.
As a prerequisite to filing a grievance, an employee must contact, either orally or in writing, the
supervisor who has taken the action causing the grievance and state his reasons for objecting to
the action taken. Both the employee and the supervisor shall make a good-faith effort to resolve
the problem prior to initiation of formal grievance proceedings.
The word "grievance" when used in this chapter means a formal written complaint of an employee
covered by the provisions of this chapter concerning actions taken by his supervisor which results
in loss of pay, written or oral reprimand or any other complaint by an employee for violation of his
rights as an employee. Grievances filed on the basis of actions of the Mayor are covered under
Subsection E of this section. The word "grievance" does not, however, include an employee
disagreement with a supervisor's evaluation. In the event of an employee's disagreement with a
supervisor's evaluation, the employee may file a written rebuttal in the personnel file but may not
file a grievance against the supervisor merely because of the evaluation.
Any employee who is aggrieved by action taken by a supervisor may file a grievance with the
Clerk within 10 days following the event causing the grievance. Within seven days following
receipt of the grievance, the Clerk shall approve, disapprove, nullify or modify the action causing
the grievance and notify the aggrieved employee in writing of his decision.
The aggrieved employee may appeal the decision of the Clerk to the Personnel Board by giving
written notice to its Chairman within seven days from receipt of the Clerk's decision.
Within 10 days from receipt by the Chairman of a notice of appeal, the Personnel Board shall
hold a hearing to consider the grievance. The hearing shall be public unless the aggrieved

whether to uphold or not uphold the decision of the Clerk. Within 10 days from the date of the
hearing, the Personnel Board shall render, in writing, a copy of that decision with an attest by
each member of the Board depicting that member's vote. The decision of the Personnel
Board should be based on the City Administration's adherence to City policy only (i.e.,
personnel policy, departmental SOP or any written policies provided to the employee by a
supervisor).
The decision of the Personnel Board shall be based upon the evidence received at the
public hearing as it pertains to implementation of City policy (i.e., personnel policy,
departmental SOP or any written policies provided to the employee by a supervisor).
Should the Personnel Board determine (majority vote required) that the City
administration did not properly implement City policy (i.e., personnel policy, departmental
SOP or any other written policies provided to the employee by a supervisor), the
deviation from policy will be clearly pointed out. The matter will be returned to the Clerk
for modification. Modifications made shall be based on the findings of the Personnel
Board. The Clerk will then forward the decision to the employee and his supervisor. In the
event of a tie vote by the Board or a majority vote upholding the Clerk's decision, the
matter is final and no other proceedings are required.
The aggrieved employee may appeal the decision of the Mayor to the Personnel Board by giving
written notice to its Chairman within seven days from receipt of the Mayor's decision.

the Clerk and the Mayor.
Within 10 days from the date of the hearing, the Personnel Board shall render, in writing, a

Board should be based on the City administration's adherence to City policy (i.e., personnel
policy, departmental SOP or any written policies provided to the employee by a supervisor).
The decision of the Personnel Board shall be based upon the evidence received at the
public hearing as it pertains to implementation of City policy (i.e., personnel policy,
departmental SOP or any written policies provided to the employee by a supervisor).
Should the Personnel Board concur with the decision of the Mayor, the decision is final

§ 108-31. Care and maintenance.
The owner or custodial person shall be responsible for the care and maintenance of an animal,
including but not limited to domestic animals, canine hybrids, cocks, guard dogs, potentially dangerous
animals, service animals and wild/exotic animals. An owner or custodian of any animal shall have the
following obligations in regard to the care and maintenance of each animal:
Owner or custodian of an animal shall provide the animal with:
Food. Animals shall be provided with uncontaminated, edible, nutritious food, in adequate
quantity to maintain the normal weight and condition of a healthy animal. Additionally, the
amount of food administered must properly conform to the individual animal's age and
condition. All food containers shall be kept clean; and
Water. Animals shall be provided with constant access to a supply of potable water in
sufficient amount to maintain good health as required by the species whether animals are
outdoors or indoors, except as directed by a veterinarian; and
Shelter and shade. Outside housing shall protect animals from weather that may be
detrimental to the health and comfort of the animal. Animals that are not allowed free access
to the household must be provided with adequate shelter and shade. A shelter alone shall not
constitute adequate shade under this section, because a structure that provides adequate
shelter might not provide adequate shade: for example, a dog house that protects the dog
from wind and rain may be too hot inside when exposed to direct sunlight during warmer
months, so shade must also be provided. Outside housing shall protect animals from any
extreme weather conditions that may be detrimental to the health or comfort of the animals;
and
Ventilation. Ventilation must be sufficient to provide for the health and safety of the animal and
prevent strong odors from forming; and
Veterinary medical care. Owner shall provide regular basic and emergency medical care for
all their animals. No person shall keep an animal that is seriously sick or injured without
providing proper veterinary care to the animal. The Animal Control Officer may require a letter
of health evaluation from a veterinarian describing the condition of the animal; and
Cleaning and grooming. Basic cleaning and grooming shall be provided as necessary for the
health and general welfare of the animal. Grooming the coat on most animals is necessary to
ensure the coat is not matted to the point that it becomes so heavy as to cause skin irritation
or trap fecal matter. The animal shall not be so dirty as to provide a home for parasites and
insects, and no animal shall be allowed to have a foreign object imbedded in its skin, fur or
hair other than a microchip for domestic animals; and
Shall not confine an animal in conditions likely to cause it to become unmanageable and
potentially dangerous.
No person shall leave an animal in an enclosed vehicle or upon a vehicle in conditions that could
result in danger to or death of the animal due to heat exposure. If an Animal Control Officer
determines that an animal in an enclosed vehicle is in immediate danger, the Animal Control
Officer may enter the vehicle to rescue the endangered animal by any means necessary, without
being liable to the owner of the vehicle. The Animal Control Officer may take any animal rescued
in this manner into protective custody.
§ 108-32. Restraint of animals.

There must be a swivel on a T-stone end of the tether to minimize tangling of the tether;
and
The tether and cable run must be of adequate size and strength to effectively restrain the
dog. The size and weight of the tether must not be excessive, as determined by the
Animal Control Officer, considering the age, size and health of the dog; and
The cable run must be at least 10 feet in length and mounted either at ground level or at
least four feet above ground level; and
The tether must be a minimum of 10 feet in length and not allow the dog to move beyond
the legal boundary of the property; and
The device must be affixed to a dog by use of a nonabrasive, comfortably fitted collar or

and
The area where the dog is confined must be kept free of garbage and other debris that
might endanger the dog's health or safety. Feces shall be cleaned up regularly, but not
less than once a week; and
The area where the dog is confined must be kept free of insect infestation, such as
anthills, wasp nests, and flea, tick, and maggot infestations.
Animals off owner's property.
Any animal off of its owner's property shall be kept on a leash at all times in compliance with
this article, and under the immediate physical control of a person capable of restraining the
animal.

deemed unlawful in this article. The owner shall be liable for any such acts by an animal, even if it
is under physical restraint.

dangerous animals.

Article I. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose
and Methods
§ 151-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Mexico has in NMSA 1978, § 3-18-7, delegated the responsibility
of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City
of Socorro in Socorro County, New Mexico, does ordain as follows.
§ 151-2. Findings of fact.
The flood hazard areas of Socorro County are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause
an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses
vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
§ 151-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
Protect human life and health;
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken
at the expense of the general public;
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone
and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;

Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone
areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
§ 151-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause
excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage;
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or
which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

Approval or denial of a floodplain development permit by the Floodplain Administrator shall be
based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following relevant factors:
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the individual owner;
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters
and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the
proposed use.
§ 151-16. Variance procedures.
The Appeal Board, as established by the community, shall hear and render judgment on requests
for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
The Appeal Board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an
error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board may appeal such decision
in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall
report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on
the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to
the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a
lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in § 151-15B of this article
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the Appeal Board
may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purpose and objectives of this chapter (Article I, § 151-3).
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.

Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as
an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
Prerequisites for granting variances:
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
Showing a good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to
the applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure
will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and
for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
The criteria outlined in Article IV, § 151-16A through I are met; and
The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages
during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
Article V. Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction
§ 151-17. General standards.
In all areas of special flood hazards, the following provisions are required for all new construction and
substantial improvements:
All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices
that minimize flood damage;
All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to
flood damage;

Article III, § 151-7, Article IV, § 151-14H, or Article V, § 151-19C, the following provisions are required:
Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to or above the base flood
elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification
to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in Article IV,
§ 151-15A(1), is satisfied.
Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated to or above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional
engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for
the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance
with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification
which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator.
Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the
lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area
other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer
or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices,
provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
Manufactured homes.
Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or
FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the
purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited
to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

Licensees are limited to planting and growing female clones or using feminized seed.
Since it is possible that one of 2,000 feminized seeds can produce a male plant, licensees are
responsible for removing male plants as soon as they are identified. Male plants present pollen
sacs after several weeks of growth, are tall and slender with few leaves surrounding the flowers,
while female plants are short and stocky with many leaves at each terminal inflorescence.
Plants with both male and female flowers, developed through breeding and selection, are
prohibited.
Regardless of their plant prorogation strategy environmental stress may result in a higher
concentration of male flowers, particularly during hot/wet spells, at the commencement of
flowering, and nearing harvest. Accordingly, it is the duty of licensees to monitor their crop and
remove and destroy any male plants immediately upon detection. See Fig. 1.[1]
Editor's Note: Figure 1 is included as an attachment at the end of this chapter.
Any property with more than .05% male to female plant density shall be prohibited and all hemp
plants (the crop) on that property are required to be immediately destroyed by the license.
As a condition of obtaining a license the licensee consents, agrees and understands that if he/she
fails to immediately destroy the crop more than .05% male to female plant density the City of
Socorro, after providing 48 hours' notice, is authorized to enter upon the licensee's land to do so
and assess the cost to the licensee.
§ 164-9. Inspection; sampling; testing.
All locations are subject to inspections by City of Socorro staff or its authorized agents, without prior
notification, to verify application information and compliance with rule requirements.
§ 164-10. Enforcement.
Each violation of this chapter, including failure to obtain a City of Socorro hemp licenses, shall be
punishable by a fine of no more than $500 pursuant to NMSA 1978 § 3-17-1 (1993).
In the event the City of Socorro is required to destroy a crop found to be in violation of § 164-8,
above, the reasonable cost destruction shall be assessed to the licensee and owner of the real
property. The cost of destruction shall constitute a lien against the real property from which the
crop was destroyed. The lien shall be foreclosed in the manner provided in NMSA § § 3-16-1 et
seq.
Any violation of this chapter will result in the cancellation of a license. The applicant may not
reapply for another license for a period of three years or at anytime any assessed cost for
destruction of a crop remains outstanding.

Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers; or
Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and
installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the
State of New Mexico Environment Department and the Superintendent and subject to the
requirements of all applicable regulations, ordinances and laws.
Testing industrial waste. Testing an industrial waste will be performed at least twice a year or
whenever found necessary by the Superintendent. The person discharging the waste shall be
liable for payment of all costs arising from the testing of the industrial waste.
Grease, oil and sand traps. Grease, oil, and sand traps shall be provided when, in the opinion of
the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease
in excessive amounts or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients, except that
such traps shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All traps shall be of a
type and capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall be located so as to be readily and
easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Grease and oil traps shall be installed in all new
filling stations, garages, restaurants and other new facilities wherein heavy discharge of grease
and oil is to be expected.
Maintenance of preliminary treatment and flow-equalizing facilities. Where preliminary treatment or
flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any industrial liquid wastes, they shall be maintained
continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
Waste meters; manholes.
When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer
carrying industrial liquid wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such
necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation,
sampling and measurement of the wastes.
Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely loaded, constructed in such a
manner so as to prevent infiltration of groundwater and surface waters and constructed in
accordance with plans approved by the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the
owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all
times.
Methods of testing; location of test site. All measurements, tests and analysis of the characteristics
of water and wastes shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard
Methods and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable samples taken
at such manhole. The control manhole shall be located so that sampling of the industrial waste will
be performed before discharge into the public sewer system.
Sampling and analysis methods. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods
to reflect the effect of constituents upon the wastewater treatment works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine
whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab
sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, COD, BOD, and settleable solids
analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples.
Access for sampling. The Superintendent shall be allowed access to the properties of all sewer
users as necessary to sample, test, and measure all wastewater discharges. Failure to allow such
access may, at the City's discretion, be the basis for discontinuance of sewer and/or water service
to the property to which access is denied.

§ 195-12. User fees.
Establishment of equitable user fees. The governing body of the City shall take the necessary
steps to establish an equitable system of user fees. The purpose hereof is that each individual
user shall pay an equitable portion of the City's cost of owning the wastewater facilities plus an
equitable portion of the total operation and maintenance costs. The cost recovery system shall
satisfy the following conditions:
The apportionment of costs must take into consideration the individual user's contribution as
related to the total waste load, taking into account the volume and strength of all discharges.
The costs to be considered should include, but are not limited to:
Amortization of the applicant's indebtedness for the cost of the treatment facilities and
sewers.
Operation and maintenance of the treatment and collection facilities.
Any additional costs which are necessary to assure adequate treatment on a continuous
basis.
Substantial prepayment of the capital investment or other financial commitments will be
required from each industry that contributes 30% or more of the total volume or strength of
the waste load to be treated by the facilities.
Fee computation for residential units. For residential units, the user fees shall be computed as
follows in accordance with the Sewer Rate Ordinance of the City of Socorro:
UC = A + (K)(V)
Where:
UC = monthly user charge fee in dollars per month.
A = minimum monthly charge in dollars per month for being connected to the sewer
system, whether or not any wastewater is discharged to the system.
K = basic user charge in dollars per month made per unit of 100 gallons of water used
per month.
V = volume of water used per month in hundreds of gallons (units); based on the
average water consumption for the months of December through February (winter
water average), inclusive, and becoming effective for each user for a nine-month
period beginning with the City's billing for the month of April.
If actual water use measurements are not available, the volume basis shall be established by
the Superintendent on the basis of expected water use for the building being served.
Billing for the months of December through February, inclusive, will be based on actual water
consumption during those months.
Fee computation for other users. For all other users, the user fees shall be computed as follows:
UC = A + (K)(V)
Where:
UC and K = as previously defined in Subsection B above.
V = actual volume of water used per month in hundreds of gallons (units);
unless a winter water average has been established and accepted by the

Superintendent for the particular user.
Industrial surcharge. A surcharge may be assessed against persons discharging industrial liquid
wastes which are of a greater strength than normal, untreated domestic wastewater. Normal,
untreated domestic wastewater is defined as having a maximum yearly average chemical oxygen
demand not in excess of 400 milligrams per liter and a settleable solids level not in excess of 5.0
milliliters per liter. The monthly industrial surcharge shall be computed from the following
formulation:
SR = (Vi)
Kss(SS-5)
5
+
KCOD (COD-400)
400
Where:
SR = surcharge in dollars per month; such surcharge being in addition to the
monthly user charge.
Vi = volume of water used per month in units of 100 gallons.
Kss = charge in dollars per month made per unit of 100 gallons of water used for
wastes of normal settleable solids concentration.
KCOD = charge in dollars per month made per unit of 100 gallons of water used for
wastes of normal COD concentration.
SS = settleable solids concentration of the industrial waste in milliliters per liter;
shall not be less than 5 for computation of the surcharge.
COD = COD concentration of the industrial waste in milligrams per liter; shall not be
less than 400 for computation of the surcharge.
Kss and KCOD shall be computed by the City to reflect the City's estimation of the respective
costs of treating the settleable solids and COD components of normal wastewater. To compute
Kss and KCOD, the following formula shall be utilized:
K = Kss + KCOD + Kv
Where:
K, Kss, and COD = are as previously defined in Subsection D above.
Kv = the estimated portion of K which may be attributed to the
processing of a unit of 100 gallons of wastewater independent of
treatment or renovation of that wastewater.
Wastewater system expansion fee. A charge (impact fee) will be paid to the City when any
building, structure or premises is connected to the sanitary sewer system operated and
maintained by the City. This charge shall be known as the "wastewater system expansion fee"
(WWSEF).
Charges for extraneous flows. Cost for operation and maintenance for all flow not directly
attributable to users (i.e., infiltration/inflow) shall be distributed among all users in the same
manner as the cost for their actual use.
Access of City to water utility records of user. For the purpose of assessing equitable user fees,
any person discharging to the sanitary sewers shall permit access by the City to water utility
records for that person's property.
Standby charges. Where vacant, uninhabited, or unused land abuts a City sewer within 100 feet
thereof, the owner or lessee shall pay a sewer standby charge to the City as reflected in the
current rate schedule.

Faulty or broken water meter; estimate. In the event of the stoppage of or the failure of any water
meter to register the full amount of water consumed, or inaccessibility of the meter, or failure by
the City to read the meter, the customer will be billed for such a period based on an estimated
normal consumption for corresponding periods in the preceding year or years, or consumption in
preceding months.
Private water system; measurement of water use. Where any person, business or industry is
connected to the public sewer system but utilizes a private water system, such person, business
or industry shall allow the City to install water meters to measure the water usage from the private
water system. The meters shall be provided by the City and installed at the cost of the sewer user.
The water usage from the private water system shall be used as the volume of water consumed
for the purposes of computing the service charge for the person, business, or industry. This is an
alternative method for establishing sewer service fees and the City, in its discretion, may instead
assess sewer fees based on a use of 100 gallons per capita per day. Such person, business, or
industry shall allow employees of the City to come onto the property and read the water meter at
all reasonable times.
Monthly payments required. The sewer charges levied pursuant to this section shall be payable
monthly, in conjunction with the monthly water bill rendered by the City. Properties outside the City
shall pay a surcharge of 50% of and in addition to the monthly charge. If bills are not paid within
10 days after the due date, a late penalty of 10% of the amount past due shall be paid. Sewer
charges shall be stated separately on the combined water and sewer bill.
The City Council shall at a future date, prior to beginning sewer services, establish by ordinance
the specific service fee schedules to be charged.
The City shall review total operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and user rates at a minimum
frequency of every two years and shall revise the fee schedule accordingly, if necessary.

payment of any fee due or unpaid at the time of such conviction, and nothing herein shall prevent
a criminal prosecution of any violation of the provisions of this article.
[Amended 7-7-2014 by Ord. No. 14-05-19]
Remedies cumulative; liens.
All remedies prescribed or liens created hereunder or under the provisions of the law for
collection and enforcement of the fees shall be cumulative, and the use of one or more
remedies by the City shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing
the provisions of this article created by the law. The fees authorized by this article shall be a
lien in favor of the City upon the real property served and the personal property of the person
used in connection with the sewer use which gave rise to the fee, and such lien shall be
imposed, collected, enforced, and paid as provided by the law. No property of any persons
shall be exempt from levy and sale on execution issued for the collection of a judgment for
any fee imposed by this article.
If any bill for sewage charges remains unpaid for 60 days, a lien on the property receiving the
sewage service shall be filed by the City Clerk, as provided by NMSA 1978, § 3-36-1 et seq.,
and shall be released only upon payment of the charges plus interest as provided by the law.

applicants, the extension will be made under the following terms and conditions by the applicant and in
accordance with the City's policies and procedures for the Utility Department:
All line extensions shall be sized to provide adequate service. In the event that the City system
plan requires larger line size than is required to serve the applicant's needs, the applicant will not
be required to absorb the difference in investment between the applicant's required line size and
the line size required by the plan; but in no event shall the extension costs to the applicant be
based on lines smaller than those needed for the applicant's domestic service. The City shall be
the sole judge of proper line sizing in any new construction and shall be the sole judge of the line
size cost to the applicant.
The investment in the line extension required to serve the applicant's domestic requirements as
specified above will be paid in total by the applicant requesting the line extension.
All lines will be constructed in existing public roads, streets, City-owned lands, alleys, or
easements. The applicant shall furnish such rights-of-way in the form of duly executed easements
without charge to the City and shall assist the City in securing other rights-of-way necessary to
provide service over property not owned by the applicant.
Special conditions which affect the furnishing of sewer service to an applicant or group of
applicants such as elevation, terrain, volume required in existing mains, and other conditions
resulting in increased costs to the City in providing sewer service shall be taken into consideration
by the City and the cost thereof shall be added to the tapping fee.

rights assigned to it, the subdivider shall pay a fee of $250 per lot to the City for acquisition of
water rights.
Fees. A fee of $10 per lot up to 10 lots and $2 thereafter shall be charged the subdivider for each
subdivision submitted for final approval to the Planning and Zoning Commission. Said fees shall

All land to be subdivided shall be suited to the purpose for which it is to be used, whether for
residential, business or industrial uses. All subdivisions shall conform to the following requirements for
land use, lot sizes, etc.
Business or industrial blocks shall be of such size and shape as may be suitable for their
prospective use and shall provide sufficient space for off-street parking and loading.
The width of any block shall be sufficient to permit at least two tiers of lots of appropriate depth,
except where double-frontage lots bordering an arterial street are used or where special terrain
problems exist.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).

Double-frontage lots are prohibited except where employed to prevent vehicular access to an
arterial street or where special terrain problems exist.[3]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
Easements for public utilities shall have a minimum width satisfactory to all agencies providing
such utility service. Whenever possible, utility easements shall extend along rear property lines.
(All utilities shall be underground and below surface depth approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. All plats shall reflect that utility service shall be underground.) Alleys must be utilized
in lieu of such easements in all lot lines separating residential from commercial zoning.
Public spaces and open spaces will be required to be dedicated as indicated in the
Comprehensive Plan. The Commission will designate what areas are to be so reserved and
dedicated to such use. In no case may such land dedication exceed 5% of the total area of the
subdivision except as noted elsewhere under this section.
Where either or both water supply and sanitary sewage shall be required, a certificate by the State
Environment Department that the proposed facilities are adequate shall be a prerequisite to final
approval of the plan.[4]

§ 207-15. Community facilities.
In reviewing subdivision plats, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the adequacy
of existing or proposed community facilities to serve the additional dwellings proposed by the
subdivision.
Subdividers, especially when designing for large tracts of land, shall provide areas for community
facilities normally considered desirable for serving residential areas, such as parks, playgrounds,
athletic fields, schools, churches, libraries, shopping and local business centers. The Commission
shall determine the amounts and designate which areas are entirely public and should be
dedicated.
Areas provided or reserved for such community facilities shall be adequate to provide for building
sites, play areas, landscaping and off-street parking as may be necessary for the use(s) proposed.
Subdividers should confer with the Commission prior to preparation of final plats in order to
develop suitable plans for providing community facilities.
Areas for community facilities may be provided through dedication or sale to a private agency,
including a property owners' association. In all cases, suitable arrangements shall be made, fixing
responsibility for sponsoring and continued maintenance of community facilities.

Local 10% 0.25%
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the Commission
may require double-frontage lots in order to protect residential areas from heavy traffic and also to
provide separation between local and through street traffic.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
New half or partial streets will not be permitted; wherever a tract to be subdivided borders an
existing half or partial street, the other part of the street shall be platted within the same tract.[2]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I).
Dead-end streets shall be prohibited except as stubs to permit future street extension into an

Local streets shall be designed so as to discourage through traffic, for which purpose loop streets
and culs-de-sac may be used.
Alleys are intended to provide secondary access to business and industrial properties for
deliveries and may be permitted in residential areas, but in no case shall an alley provide the only
means of access to a lot.
Crosswalks are intended to provide pedestrian circulation through large blocks or in developments
where it is desired to separate pedestrian from vehicular traffic.
Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. No street shall intersect
another at less than 75°.
Intersections of more than two streets (four-way intersections) shall be avoided. Where this proves
impossible, such intersections shall be designed with care for safety, and suitable curbs, barriers,
signs, and other devices may be required. Four-way intersections shall be kept to a minimum in
residential areas.
Clear sight triangles at intersections shall be provided. A line joining two points, each 25 feet from
opposing curblines of an intersection, shall be kept clear of all objects over three feet high or have
a clearance of at least eight feet beneath the object.[3]

Cashiers Office, of the receipts for lodging in the preceding calendar month, and shall submit the

Every vendor is liable for the payment of the proceeds of any occupancy tax and convention
center fee that the vendor failed to remit to the city, whether due to the vendor's failure to collect
the tax or otherwise. Vendors shall be liable for the tax, plus a civil penalty equal to the greater of
10% of the amount not remitted or $100. The City shall give the delinquent vendor written notice of
the delinquency, which notice shall be mailed either to the vendor's local or business address,
informing the lodging facility of the delinquency and penalty due. Failure to receive the notice does
not abate the delinquency and penalty fee.
If payment is not received within 15 days of the date due, interest will accrue at the rate of 1% per
month or prorated for a partial month on the unpaid balance of the tax and penalty.
If payments are not received within 15 days of the mailing of the notice, the City may bring an
action in law or equity in the district court for the collection of any amounts due, including, without
limitation, penalties thereon, interest on the unpaid principal at a rate not exceeding 1% a month. If
the City attempts collection through an attorney or the City Attorney for any purpose with regard to
this article, the vendor shall be liable to the City for all costs, fees paid to the attorney or City
attorney, and all other expenses incurred in connection therewith.
The occupancy tax and convention center fee imposed by the City of Socorro constitutes a lien in
favor of the City upon the personal and real property of the property owner of the lodgings. The
lien may be enforced as provided in NMSA 1978, §§ 3-36-1 through 3-36-7. Priority of the lien
shall be determined from the date of filing.·
The payments due under this article, together with all penalties, fees, interest and other charges
prescribed, shall become a personal liability of the owner of the property. In addition to collection
through foreclosure of the lien, collection may be enforced on such personal liability by resort to
any other legal procedure available for the enforcement of personal liabilities.
Under process or order of court, no person shall sell the property of a vendor without first
ascertaining from the City Treasurer the amount of an occupancy tax or convention center fee due
the City. Any occupancy tax or convention center fee due the City shall be paid from the proceeds
of the sale before payment is made to any judgment creditor or any other person with a claim on
the proceeds of the sale.
§ 213-12. Criminal penalties; other sanctions.
Any person who violates the provisions of the lodgers' tax ordinance for a failure to pay the tax, to
remit proceeds thereof to the City or to properly account for any lodging and tax proceeds
pertaining thereto shall be guilty of a petty misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be fined in an
amount not to exceed $500 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 90 days, or both.
The City may bring an action in the district court for collection of amounts due, including, without
limitation, penalties on the amounts due on the unpaid principal at a rate not exceeding 1% per
month, the costs of collection and reasonable attorney fees incurred in connection with the court
action to collect the unpaid tax.
§ 213-13. Refunds and credits.
If any person believes he has made payment of any lodgers' tax in excess of that for which he was
liable, he may claim a refund thereof by directing to the City Treasurer, no later than 90 days from
the date payment was made, a written claim for refund accompanied by a restated lodgers' tax
reporting form for that period. Every claim for refund shall state the nature of the person's
complaint and the affirmative relief requested. The City Treasurer shall allow the claim in whole or
in part or may deny it.

contributed to the cause of an accident resulting in injury or death to any person.

exceed the penalty assessment established for the particular penalty assessment misdemeanor,
and no probation imposed upon a suspended or deferred sentence shall exceed 90 days.

allergenic significance, or which constitute a fire hazard when wind collected, or which otherwise
present a hazard or nuisance to inhabitants of the City of Socorro. Further, this chapter is intended to
promote the growth of native and other grasses and plants whose root structures tend to aid in
stabilizing the soil and reducing dust. It is also the intent of this chapter that by prohibiting those
methods of plant removal and control which fail to differentiate between harmful and helpful plants and
which tend to create the still greater problem of air pollution, the aforementioned purposes will be
realized and accomplished.

Article VIII. Zoning Districts
§ 250-8.1. Purpose; types of uses.
General districts are residential, commercial, light industrial, historic, and agricultural zoning districts in
the City. This Article VIII outlines the intended purpose of each general district and states the
permitted, special and conditional uses for each district.
Permitted use defined. A permitted use is a use which is listed as permitted by right in a zoning
district. Nonspecified uses which are similar to those specified are also permitted by right, except
as otherwise restricted within this chapter.
Conditional use defined. A conditional use is a use that is considered compatible to a permitted
use and is described as conditional in specific zones. A conditional use permit requires review and
approval by the Commission to determine if the use is desirable or essential to the public welfare,
safety, health, morals or convenience of the residents in that zone. The City may impose
standards for development of conditional uses to ensure the uses will not adversely affect the
public or surrounding property owners. See § 250-5.2 for procedures governing conditional use
permits.
Special use defined. A special use is a use which is of an unusual or unique character and which
may be offensive or incompatible in some cases within a zoning district. A special use requires
review and approval by the City Council, after recommendation by the Commission, to determine
impacts on the surrounding area. The City may impose standards for development of special uses
to ensure the uses will not adversely affect the public or surrounding property owners. See § 250-
5.5 for procedures governing special use permits.
§ 250-8.2. R-1 Single Family, Low Density Residential District.
Purpose. The R-1 District is intended to accommodate detached single-family dwelling units and

§ 250-11.1. Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to present minimum standards for the installation of manufactured
homes and mobile homes in appropriate zones. This article also presents standards for mobile
home parks and subdivisions and RV parks within the City of Socorro.
The City of Socorro encourages the installation of well-constructed, aesthetically pleasing
manufactured or mobile homes in the zones in which they are permitted. The City realizes that
most such installations will be more or less permanent and provide a permanent housing source
for residents of the City. Therefore, this article attempts to create the proper standards for
manufactured and mobile home installation which are pleasing to the eye and lend to the
improvement and safety of the overall community.
§ 250-11.2. Manufactured homes.
Pursuant to NMSA 1978, § 3-21A-3, as amended, manufactured housing which conforms to the
definition included in Article XVI of this chapter shall be permitted in those zones and under those
conditions as permitted for single-family site-built housing. Manufactured housing shall be constructed
according to the Housing and Urban Development Zone Code II or the Uniform Building Code and
shall not be modified or altered subsequent to initial construction but prior to placement in the City of
Socorro. Manufactured housing shall only be allowed within the Historic Zone if it is consistent with the
standards established in this chapter for that zone.
