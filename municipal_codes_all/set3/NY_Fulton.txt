such adjacent property for a public use. A person claiming damages
from such change of grade must present to the Commissioner of Public
Works a verified claim therefor, within sixty (60) days after the change
of grade is completed. The Commissioner may agree with such owner
upon the amount of damages to be allowed to him. If no agreement is
made within thirty (30) days after the presentation of the claim, the
person presenting it may apply to the Supreme Court for the
appointment of three (3) Commissioners to determine the
compensation to which he is entitled. As to all such claims presented
after the first day of June 1911, and such application must be made
within one (1) year from the date when such claim is presented to the
Commissioner of Public Works, and an omission to make such
application within such time shall be a bar to the recovery of any
damages under this section. Notice of application must be served upon
the Commissioner of Public Works at least ten (10) days before the
hearing thereof. All proceedings subsequent to the appointment of the
Commissioners appointed to determine such compensation shall be

The Common Council finds that it is a necessary and proper function of the
municipal government to engage in the collection of refuse as defined in this
section. In order to effectuate this function, the Common Council further
finds that some restrictions and parameters must be placed on the method
of collection and disposal. It is also essential that all, or substantially all,
of the cost of collection and disposal be borne by those persons who are
eligible to participate in the collection and disposal system.
Therefore it shall be the purpose of this chapter to protect and promote
the health, safety and welfare of the people of the City of Fulton and
property values by controlling the storage, collection and disposal of refuse
within said City of Fulton; and to provide for an effective system of revenue
collection to support the municipal services provided.

Collection and Disposal of Garbage, Refuse and Recyclables" and shall be
commonly referred to as the "Collection and Disposal Local Law."

A. It shall be the responsibility of the Department of Public Works, through
its Commissioner, to fulfill the purpose of this chapter. Such
Commissioner shall be authorized and empowered to adopt rules and
regulations pertaining to this chapter, as he may deem advisable, in
order to control the collection and disposal of refuse and other
materials within the City of Fulton, provided that such rules and
regulations are not contrary to said chapter, and further provided that
no rules and regulations shall become effective until a copy of the same
is filed in the office of the Clerk/Chamberlain and published within the
official newspaper of the city. [Amended 12-1-2009 by L.L. No.

PROCUREMENT POLICY
§ 116-1. Determination of type of purchase; competitive bidding.
Council is only required to review and consider the
recommendation of the Planning Commission.
§ 110-4 CHARTER § 116-1
C:139
§ 116-2. Method for securing goods and services.
A. Every purchase to be made must be initially reviewed to determine
whether it is a purchase contract or a public works contract. Once that
determination is made, a good faith effort will be made to determine
whether it is known or can reasonably be expected that the aggregate
amount to be spent on the item of supply or service is not subject to
competitive bidding, taking into account past purchases and the
aggregate amount to be spent in a year. The following items are not
subject to competitive bidding pursuant to § 103 of the General
Municipal Law:
(1) Purchase contracts under $10,000 and public works contracts
under $20,000.
(2) Emergency purchases; goods purchased from agencies for the
blind or severely handicapped.
(3) Goods purchased from correctional institutions.
(4) Purchases under state and county contracts.
(5) Surplus and secondhand purchases from another governmental
entity.
B. The decision that a purchase is not subject to competitive bidding will
be documented in writing by the individual making the purchase. This
documentation may include written or verbal quotes from vendors, a
memo from the purchaser indicating how the decision was arrived at, a
copy of the contract indicating the source which makes the item or
service exempt, a memo from the purchaser detailing the
circumstances which led to an emergency purchase or any other
written documentation that is appropriate.
A. All goods and services will be secured by use of written requests for
proposals, written quotations, verbal quotations or any other method
that assures that goods will be purchased at the lowest price and that
favoritism will be avoided, except in the following circumstances:
purchase contracts over $10,000 and public works contracts over
$20,000; goods purchased from agencies for the blind or severely
handicapped pursuant to § 186 of the Correction Law; purchases under
state contracts pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 3, of the General
Municipal Law; or purchases pursuant to § 116-4 of this policy.
B. The following method of purchase will be used when required by this
policy in order to achieve the highest savings:
(1) Purchase contract:
§ 116-1 FULTON CODE § 116-2
C:140
§ 116-3. Documentation required.
§ 116-4. Exceptions.
Pursuant to General Municipal Law § 104-b, Subdivision 2f,85 the
procurement policy may contain some circumstances when, or types of
procurements for which, in the sole discretion of the governing body, the
solicitation of alternative proposals or quotation will not be in the best
interest of the municipality. In the following circumstances, it may not be in
Estimated Amount Method
$0 to $249 Purchaser uses best judgment to obtain
lowest price
$250 to $2,999 Verbal quotations
$3,000 to $9,999 Written/fax quotations or RFPs (requests
for proposals)
$10,000 and up Bid pursuant to § 103 of the General
Municipal Law
(2) Public works contract:
Estimated Amount Method
$0 to $249 Purchaser uses best judgment to obtain
lowest price
$250 to $2,999 Verbal quotations
$3,000 to $4,999 Written/fax quotations
$5,000 to $19,999 Written/fax or RFPs (requests for
proposals)
$20,000 and up Bid pursuant to § 103 of the General
Municipal Law
C. A good faith effort shall be made to obtain the required number of
proposals or quotations. If the purchaser is unable to obtain the
required number of proposals or quotations, the purchaser will
document the attempt made at obtaining the proposals. In no event
shall the failure to obtain the proposals be a bar to the procurement.
A. Documentation is required of each action taken in connection with each
procurement.
B. Documentation and an explanation is required whenever a contract is
awarded to other than the lowest responsible offeror. This
documentation will include an explanation of how the award will
achieve savings or how the offeror was not responsible. A
determination that the offeror is not responsible shall be made by the
purchaser and may not be challenged under any circumstances.

C:141
the best interests of the City of Fulton to solicit quotations or document the
basis for not accepting the lowest bid:
A. Professional services or services requiring special or technical skill,
training or expertise.
(1) The individual or company must be chosen based on accountability,
reliability, responsibility, skill, education and training, judgment,
integrity and moral worth. These qualifications are not necessarily
found in the individual or company that offers the lowest price, and
the nature of these services are such that they do not readily lend
themselves to competitive procurement procedures. In
determining whether a service fits into this category, the City of
Fulton shall take into consideration the following guidelines:
(a) Whether the services are subject to state licensing or testing
requirements.
(b) Whether substantial formal education or training is a
necessary prerequisite to the performance of the services.
(c) Whether the services require a personal relationship between
the individual and municipal officials.
(2) Professional or technical services shall include but are not limited
to the following: services of an attorney; services of a physician;
technical services of an engineer engaged to prepare plans, maps
and estimates; securing insurance coverage and/or services of an
insurance broker; services of a certified public accountant;
investment management services; printing services involving
extensive writing, editing or art work; management of municipally
owned property; and computer software or programming services
for customized programs or services involved in substantial
modification and customizing of prepackaged software.
B. Emergency purchases pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 4, of the General
Municipal Law. Due to the nature of this exception, these goods or
services must be purchased immediately, and a delay in order to seek
alternate proposals may threaten the life, health, safety or welfare of
the residents. This section does not preclude alternate proposals if time
permits.
C. Purchases of surplus and secondhand goods from any source. If
alternate proposals are required, the City of Fulton is precluded from
purchasing surplus and secondhand goods at auctions or through
specific advertised sources where the best prices are usually obtained.
It is also difficult to try to compare prices of used goods, and a lower
price may indicate an older product.
D. Goods or services under $250. The time and documentation required to
purchase through this policy may be more costly than the item itself
and would, therefore, not be in the best interests of the taxpayer. In
§ 116-4 FULTON CODE § 116-4

§ 116-5. When effective; review.
This policy shall go into effect immediately and will be reviewed after six
months for adjustments. Thereafter, it shall be reviewed annually.

Open Containers
[Adopted 6-23-1944; amended in its entirety 4-29-1986 (Ch. 37, Art.
I, of the 1991 Code)]
§ 210-1. Legislative findings.
The Common Council of the City of Fulton, the legislative body of said City,
makes the following findings:
§ 210-2. Determination.
It has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Common Council of
the City of Fulton that the possession of open, unsealed containers of
alcohol and the actual consumption of alcohol on public streets and in public
places has been proven to be a significant and substantial cause of the
congregation of persons who, in turn, cause and promote unruly, disruptive,
uncontrollable, obnoxious and generally offensive behavior. Therefore, the
Common Council of the City of Fulton considers it to be in the best interest
of the residents of the City of Fulton to enact this article.
A. Consumption of alcoholic beverages in public streets and public places,
except under certain, licensed circumstances, is detrimental to the
health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City of Fulton.
B. Consumption of alcoholic beverages in public streets and public places
causes unsightly and unsanitary conditions, creates a nuisance and
interferes with the peace and good order of said City.
C. Based upon a review of the complaints on file with the Fulton Police
Department and on discussions with the Chief of Police of the City of
Fulton, possession of alcoholic beverages with the intent to consume
the same and the actual consumption of alcoholic beverages on public
streets and in public places is a serious, substantial and significant
cause of persons (especially persons who are under the legal age for
purchasing alcohol) becoming unruly, disruptive, disorderly,
uncontrollable, obnoxious, offensive and of a general character
detrimental to the health, welfare and peaceful orderliness of the
community.
D. This Common Council finds that this article is necessary and proper in
order to promote the health, welfare and safety of the general public
and that the restrictions on conduct created by this article are not

[Adopted 5-19-1992 (Ch. 100, Art. I, of the 1991 Code)]
§ 247-1. Employees.
§ 247-2. Fee structure; issuance of permits.
A. One or two people should man the marina facility during the week.
Employees should be expected to do the following:
(1) Welcome boaters.
(2) Help boaters to tie up.
(3) Answer basic questions about Fulton.
(4) Collect applicable fees.
B. When employees are not busy, they should be responsible for light
maintenance work, such as cleaning bathrooms, weeding lawns and
general housekeeping of the area.
C. Training. Employees should receive a one- or two-day orientation of
what is expected of them on the job, including instructions on how to tie
up a boat, etc.
A. Seasonal. Seasonal fees shall be as follows: $25 per foot for boats
owned by City residents; $30 per foot for boats owned by nonresidents.
There is an additional charge of $0.75 per foot for water and sewer and
electric.
B. Daily. Daily fees shall be as follows: $0.50 per foot without water and
power; $0.75 per foot with water and power.
C. Payment of seasonal fees; permit procedure.
(1) The seasonal fee for residents and nonresidents must be paid in
advance by mail or in person to the Clerk/Chamberlain's office.
[Amended 12-1-2009 by L.L. No. 6-2009]
(2) The suggested format for accepting seasonal permits is as follows:
(a) An ad shall be published in the local newspaper(s) as follows:
"Seasonal permits available for the Fulton Marina on the
Oswego River. For application, write to or apply in person at
the Clerk/Chamberlain's office, City of Fulton, 141 South First
Street, Fulton, New York. $25 per foot for residents; and $30
per foot for nonresidents." [Amended 12-1-2009 by L.L. No.
6-2009]
§ 247-1 CHARTER § 247-2
C:185
(b) Permit applications will be sent to applicants and accepted on a
first-come-first-served basis. A sample permit application is
attached.97
(c) Applicants must bring in their proof of boater registration
(registration has boat size on it) with their seasonal check.
D. Payment of daily fees; issuance of permits.
(1) Permits should be distributed upon arrival. Boaters should be
advised that fees are payable at 6:00 p.m. each evening. This is the
most effective way to ensure that only boaters who stay overnight
are assessed the fee.
(2) Fees can be collected by the staff, using carbon, numbered receipts
so that there is a checks-and-balance system, or be made payable at
the Lock III Restaurant.
(3) Enforcement can be done by having the staff check which boaters
have permits the first thing each morning.
(4) If the Lock III Restaurant is going to issue permits, appropriate
signage should be posted, as follows: "Overnight permits (6:00 p.m.
to 8:00 a.m.) available in the Lock III Restaurant."
(5) Signage. There is a sign notifying boaters that there is a fee
charged; however, it should be clearer than the current signage.
The sign in place states "MARINA: BY PERMIT ONLY (arrow)
598-4504 for permit." This sign is misleading because this gives the
impression that people must have a presold permit. The new
signage could state: "WELCOME TO FULTON: Overnight Docking
$_____."
97.Editor's Note: Samples of the marina seasonal application and the marina permits are
included as attachments to this chapter.

§ 277-2. Findings.
The Common Council of the City of Fulton, in conjunction with the Bureau
Chief of the Bureau of Code Enforcement, the Plumbing Board, the
Electrical Board, the Fire Department and other interested persons and
entities, finds that the public health, safety and welfare are promoted

administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying floodplain
development permits in accordance with its provisions.
§ 341-11. Floodplain development permit; fees.
§ 341-12. Application for permit.
The applicant shall provide the following information as appropriate.
Additional information may be required on the permit application form.
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of protecting its
citizens from increased flood hazards and insuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 341-6, without a valid floodplain development permit.
Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the local
administrator and may include but not be limited to plans, in duplicate,
drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions, and
elevations of the area in question, existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the
foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee of $100. In addition, the applicant
shall be responsible for reimbursing the City of Fulton for any
additional costs necessary for review, inspection and approval of this
project. The local administrator may require a deposit of no more than
$500 to cover these additional costs.
A. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially improved
structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH, or Zone A if base
flood elevation data are available. Upon completion of the lowest floor,
the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
elevation, certified by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor.
B. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any new
or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be floodproofed.
Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the structure, the

utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 341-17C, Utilities.
D. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing
criteria in § 341-19, Nonresidential structures.
E. A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by a
licensed professional engineer must be submitted that demonstrate
that the altered or relocated segment will provide equal or greater
conveyance than the original stream segment. The applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the
documents enumerated in § 341-6, when notified by the local
administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the
conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be
maintained.
F. A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required by
the local administrator, which shows whether proposed development to
be located in an area of special flood hazard may result in physical
damage to any other property.
G. In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from other
sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit
applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home and recreational vehicle
parks and subdivisions) that are greater than either 50 lots or five
acres.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 341-12, Application for permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of Article V, Construction Standards, and, in
particular, § 341-15, Subdivision proposals.
§ 341-12 FULTON CODE § 341-13

flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
Article V, Construction Standards, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.

Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 341-12G, as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meets the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
(1) Notify adjacent communities and the New York State Department
of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of such
notification to the Regional Administrator, Region II, Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage. The local administrator shall, in Zones A1-A30, AE
and AH, and also Zone A if base flood elevation data are available, upon
placement of the lowest floor or completion of floodproofing of a new or
substantially improved structure, obtain from the permit holder a
certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed
§ 341-13 CHARTER § 341-13
C:273
elevation, in relation to mean sea level. The certificate shall be
prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor
or professional engineer and certified by same. For manufactured
homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation upon
placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of elevation must
also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a site for
180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed and ready
for highway use). Any further work undertaken prior to submission
and approval of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk.
The local administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies
detected shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 341-8 of this chapter.
(2) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found noncompliant
with the provisions of this chapter and/or the conditions of the

consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search and rescue operations during periods of
flooding;
§ 341-21 CHARTER § 341-21
C:283
§ 341-22. Conditions for variances.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations,
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D and the purposes of
this chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes
of this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing the items in
§ 341-21D(1) to (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure; and
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:

increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
§ 341-21 FULTON CODE § 341-22
C:284
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
G. Notification.
(1) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
(a) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage; and
(b) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property.
(2) Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance
actions as required in § 341-13H of this chapter.

§ 356-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as "A Local Law to Regulate Outdoor Furnaces
and Boilers in the City of Fulton."
§ 341-22 FULTON CODE § 356-2
C:286
§ 356-2. Findings; legislative intent.
The Common Council of the City of Fulton finds that although outdoor
furnaces or boilers may provide an economical alternative to conventional
heating systems, concerns have been raised regarding the safety and
environmental impacts of these heating devices, particularly the production
of offensive odors and potential health effects of uncontrolled emissions.
It is generally recognized that the types of fuel used and the scale and
duration of burning by outdoor furnaces or boilers create noxious and
hazardous smoke, soot, fumes, odors and air pollution, can be detrimental
to citizens' health, and can deprive neighboring residents of the enjoyment
of their property or premises. Therefore, with the adoption of this chapter, it
is the intention of the Common Council to establish and impose restrictions
upon the construction or installation and operation of outdoor furnaces and
boilers within the City of Fulton for the purpose of securing and promoting
the public health, comfort, convenience, safety, welfare and prosperity of
the City and its residents.
§ 356-3. Applicability.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the installation of all outdoor
furnaces and boilers within the City of Fulton. The provisions of this chapter

§ 392-1 CHARTER § 435-1
C:291
§ 435-2. Public nuisance defined.
For the purposes of this chapter, a public nuisance is declared to exist
where:
A. The Common Council finds that public nuisances exist in the City of
Fulton in the operation of certain establishments and the use of
property in flagrant violation of the penal laws of this state and related
statutes, all of which substantially and seriously interfere with the
interests of the public in the quality of life and total community
environment, commerce in the City, property values and the public
health, safety and welfare.
B. The Common Council further finds that many landlords do not
adequately screen their tenants and some in fact feel that a bad tenant
is better than no tenant.
C. The Common Council further finds that while existing laws may be
adequate to punish offensive conduct and bring violators into
compliance, said laws are not adequate to abate the nuisances created
by multiple offenders.
D. The Common Council further finds that the continued occurrence of
such activities, violations and attitudes is detrimental to the health,
safety and welfare of the City of Fulton and of the business thereof and
the visitors thereto. It is the purpose of this chapter to authorize and
empower the Chief of Police to impose sanctions and penalties for such
public nuisances, and such powers may be exercised either in
conjunction with, or apart from, the powers contained in other laws
without prejudice to the use of procedures and remedies available
under such other laws. The Council further finds that the sanctions and
penalties imposed by the Chief pursuant to this chapter constitute an
additional and appropriate method of law enforcement in response to
the proliferation of the above-described public nuisances. The sanctions
and penalties are reasonable and necessary in order to protect the
health and safety of the people of the City and to promote the general
welfare.
A. Controlled substances and marijuana offenses:

predicated on events, circumstances or activities occurring on
the premises; or
(b) Discovery by any law enforcement agency or duly authorized
agent thereof of a quantity and quality of drug or substance on

the top conforms to the adjacent road grade, slope and pitch.
A. All sanitary sewers or extensions to sanitary sewers shall satisfy
requirements of a final exfiltration test before they will be approved and
wastewater flow permitted by the City. The exfiltration test required
herein shall be performed by the property owner, builder or developer
under the supervision of the City Engineer or enforcement officer, or
persons designated by either of them, who shall have the responsibility
for making the proper and accurate measurements required. This test
consists of filling the pipe with water to provide a head of at least five
feet above the top of the pipe or five feet above groundwater, whichever
is higher, at the highest point of the pipeline under test and then
measuring the loss of water from the line by the amount which must be
added to maintain the original level. In this test, the line must remain
filled with water for at least 24 hours prior to the taking of
measurement. Exfiltration shall be measured by the drop of water level
in a standpipe with closed bottom end or in one of the sewer manholes
available for convenient measuring.
B. When a standpipe and plug arrangement is used in the upper manhole
of a line under test, there must be some positive method of releasing
entrapped air in the sewer prior to taking measurements. The test
length intervals for either type of test shall be as ordered or approved,
but in no event shall they exceed 1,000 feet. In the case of sewers laid
on steep grades, the length of line to be tested by exfiltration at any one
time may be limited by the maximum allowable internal pressure on the
pipe and joints at the lower end of the line. The test period wherein the
measurements are taken shall not be less than two hours in either type
of test.
C. The total leakage of any section tested shall not exceed the rate of 100
gallons per mile of pipe in 24 hours per inch of manufacturer's
designation of internal pipe diameter. For purposes of determining the
maximum allowable leakage, manholes shall be considered as sections
of forty-eight-inch-diameter pipe five feet long. The equivalent leakage
allowance shall be 4.5 gallons per manhole per 24 hours for the fortyeight-
inch-diameter manholes. If leakage exceeds the specified amount,
the necessary repairs or replacements required shall be made to
permanently reduce the leakage to within the specified limit, and the
tests shall be repeated until the exfiltration test is met.

C:442
§ 514-15. Building permit issuance restricted.
No property owner, builder or developer shall be issued a building permit
for a new dwelling or structure requiring sanitary facilities within the
City unless a suitable and approved method of disposal of wastewater
conforming to the provisions of this chapter is proposed. All housing
construction or building development which takes place after these
regulations are enacted shall provide for an approved system of sanitary
sewers.
§ 514-16. Certificate of insurance.
Any person constructing or causing to be constructed wastewater facilities
or any part thereof or private wastewater disposal facilities must present a
certificate of insurance showing a minimum liability insurance of $100,000
before a permit will be issued for construction of the same.
A. All sanitary sewers and extensions to sanitary sewers constructed at the
property owner's, builder's or developer's expense, after final approval
and acceptance by the City Engineer, shall become the property of the
City and shall thereafter be maintained by the City.
B. Said sewers, after their acceptance by the City, shall be guaranteed
against defects in materials or workmanship for one year by the builder
or developer. The guaranty shall be in such form and contain such
provisions as is required by the Common Council, secured by a surety
bond or such other security as the Common Council may approve.

licensed plumber at the owner's expense. The street lateral shall be
installed with a cleanout to grade located at the property line. The cost
of constructing the street lateral from the existing main sewer to the
property line will be at the owner's expense; all subsequent costs and
expense incidental to the installation and connection of the building
lateral shall also be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the
City from any loss or damage that may, directly or indirectly, be
occasioned by the installation of the building lateral. It shall be the
responsibility of the homeowner to maintain, repair or replace the
building lateral. The method of connection of the building lateral to the
street lateral will be dependent upon the type of sewer material used
and, in all cases, shall be approved by the enforcement officer. After the
installation of the street lateral has been approved by the enforcement
officer, the new street lateral shall become the property of the City of
Fulton. Any repairs to new street laterals shall be made by the City at
the City's expense.
B. If, in the judgment of the enforcement officer, it is determined that a
building lateral without a property-line cleanout needs repair or
replacement, the City can install, at the owner's expense, a cleanout at
the property line such that the street lateral can be maintained
independent of the building lateral.
C. Any existing street lateral which, upon examination by the enforcement
officer, is determined to be in need of replacement will be replaced with
a new street lateral with a property-line cleanout. The replacement
street lateral shall be constructed by a licensed plumber. The cost of
constructing the replacement street lateral and cleanout will be at the
owner's expense. Once the replacement street lateral and cleanout
have been constructed and approved by the enforcement officer, the
new street lateral shall become the property of the City of Fulton. Any
repairs to new street laterals shall be made by the City at the City's
expense.
A. The applicant for the building lateral permit shall notify the
enforcement officer when the building lateral is ready for inspection
and connection to the street lateral. The connection shall be made
under the supervision of the enforcement officer or his representative.
When street laterals are installed pursuant to § 514-11, the property
owner, builder or developer shall notify the enforcement officer when
the street lateral is ready for inspection and connection to the main
sewer, and such connection shall be made under the supervision of the
enforcement officer or his representative.

C:466
A. When requested, the enforcement officer shall make available to the
public for inspection and/or copying information and data on industrial
users obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications,
permit and monitoring programs and from inspections, unless the
industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the enforcement officer that such information, if made
public, would divulge processes or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets of the user or that such information is
maintained for the regulation of commercial enterprise and, if made
public, would cause substantial injury to the competitive position of the
user. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be
recognized as confidential.
B. Confidential information shall not be made available for inspection and/
or copying by the public but shall be disclosed upon written request to
governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit or the State
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) permit, provided that

Sewer Service Charges108
[Amended 12-8-1987 by L.L. No. 2-1987]
§ 514-53. Basis of charges. [Amended 11-7-1996 by L.L. No.
15-1996]
A. The source of the revenues for retiring debt services, capital
expenditures and operation and maintenance of the POTW shall be a
sewer service charge assigned to owners of property located within or
outside the corporate limits of the City whose residence or place of
business is connected to the public sewer system.
B. Sewer service charge rates shall be determined by the City of Fulton
Common Council on an annual (quarterly) basis. The sewer service
charge will be computed quarterly and made a part of the City water
bill. Charges will be calculated on a fair-user basis, with separate
methods used for calculating user charges, based on operation and
maintenance expenses, and capital recovery charges, based on local
share debt recovery. Separate methods will be used to determine fairuser
charges for domestic/ commercial/nonsignificant industrial users
and significant industrial users, as defined in Subsections C and D
below.
C. Revenues for defraying the operation and maintenance costs shall be
raised by assigning a user charge to all users of the City's POTW.
Separate user charges shall be levied for significant industrial users
and domestic/commercial/nonsignificant industrial users. Annual user
charges shall be levied over quarterly billing periods.
(1) User charges for significant industrial users shall be based on all
factors which significantly influence the operation and
maintenance costs of the treatment facilities. These factors shall
include volume, BOD, suspended solids and total phosphorus. The
amount of the significant industrial user charge required shall be
calculated by the City utilizing the User Charge Formula for
Significant Industrial Users (as appended to this chapter).109 If a
significant industrial user discharges domestic wastes to the POTW
independently of industrial wastes (i.e., through a separate
building lateral), then the user charges for the domestic wastes
shall be calculated as defined in Subsection C(2) below or as
otherwise consistent with the sewer service charges assessed
domestic/commercial/nonsignificant industrial users, and the User
Charge Formula for Significant Industrial Users shall apply only to
the industrial wastes discharged independently of the domestic
wastes.
108. Editor's Note: The formulas for determining charges are included as attachments to this
chapter.
109. Editor's Note: The User Charge Formula for Significant Industrial Users is included as an
attachment to this chapter.
§ 514-53 CHARTER § 514-53
C:469
(2) User charges for domestic/commercial/nonsignificant industrial
users shall be based on volume only since wastewater
characteristics of sanitary wastes are similar. The amount of
domestic/commercial/nonsignificant industrial user charge shall be
calculated by the City utilizing the User Charge Formula for
Domestic/Commercial/Nonsignificant Industrial Users (as
appended to this chapter110). Volume of wastewater produced shall
be determined by metered water consumption, or, for significant
industrial users which discharge domestic wastes independently of
industrial wastes [as per Subsection C(1)], upon a City-determined
unit flow in gallons per workday per employee multiplied by the
number of significant industrial user's employees. The base unit
flow for domestic wastes discharged from significant industrial
users shall be 15 gallons per day per employee, adjusted as deemed
appropriate by the City based upon the actual facilities and sources
of domestic waste being discharged from the significant industrial
user to the POTW. These facilities and sources may include, but are
not limited to, sanitary facilities, laundries, wastewater-generating
cafeterias and shower facilities. Alternatively, the significant
industrial user may, at its own expense and subject to review by the
City, install flow metering equipment to measure actual volumes of
separate domestic waste discharges to the POTW. Data acquired in
this manner will be considered by the City in determining the
wastewater volume for the separate domestic waste discharges
from the significant industrial user.
D. Revenues for defraying the local share debt service costs shall be raised
by assigning a capital recovery charge to all users of the City's POTW.
Separate capital recovery charges shall be levied for significant
industrial users and domestic/ commercial/nonsignificant industrial
users. Annual capital recovery charges shall be levied over quarterly
billing periods.
(1) Annual capital recovery charges for significant industrial users
shall be based on the proportion of local share project costs
attributable to the allocated capacity of the industrial user.
Allocated capacity shall be based on the factors of volume, BOD,
suspended solids and total phosphorus. The amount of the annual
significant industrial capital recovery charge required shall be
calculated by the City utilizing the Capital Recovery Charge
Formula for Significant Industrial Users (as appended to this
chapter111). If a significant industrial user discharges domestic
wastes to the POTW independently of industrial wastes (i.e.,
through a separate building lateral), then the capital recovery
charges for the domestic wastes shall be calculated as defined in
Subsection D(2) below or as otherwise consistent with the sewer
110. Editor's Note: Said formula is included as an attachment to this chapter.

service charges assessed domestic/commercial/nonsignificant
industrial users, and the Capital Recovery Charge Formula for
Significant Industrial Users shall apply only to the industrial wastes
discharged independently of the domestic wastes.
(2) Capital recovery charges for domestic/commercial/nonsignificant
industrial users shall be based on the proportion of local share
project costs attributable to the allocated capacity of the domestic/
commercial/nonsignificant industrial user. The amount of the
annual domestic/commercial/nonsignificant industrial capital
recovery charge shall be calculated by the City utilizing the Capital
Recovery Charge Formula for Domestic/Commercial/
Nonsignificant Industrial Users (as appended to this chapter112).
Volume of wastewater produced shall be determined by metered
water consumption, or, for significant industrial users which
discharge domestic wastes independently of industrial wastes [as
per Subsection D(1)], upon a City-determined unit flow in gallons
per workday per employee multiplied by the number of significant
industrial user's employees. The base unit flow for domestic wastes
discharged from significant industrial users shall be 15 gallons per
day per employee, adjusted as deemed appropriate by the City
based upon the actual facilities and sources of domestic water
being discharged from the significant industrial user to the POTW.
These facilities and sources may include, but are not limited to,
sanitary facilities, laundries, wastewater-generating cafeterias and
shower facilities. Alternatively, the significant industrial user may,
at its own expense and subject to review by the City, install flow
metering equipment to measure actual volumes of separate
domestic waste discharges to the POTW. Data acquired in this
manner will be considered by the City in determining the
wastewater volume for the separate domestic waste discharges
from the significant industrial user.
E. The Common Council reserves the right, from time to time, to change
sewer service charges originally or previously assigned to any property
owner.
F. Fee.
(1) The City shall defray the costs of its industrial pretreatment
program (IPP), as required by 40 CFR Part 403, by assessing a fee
to industrial users included in the City's IPP. The fee assessed shall
be based upon the actual costs incurred by the City in the
implementation of its IPP, which may include:
(a) Reimbursement of costs for setting up and operating the
pretreatment program;
(b) Issuing permits;

Part 403; and
(i) Other reasonable expenses to carry out the program to satisfy
the requirements of this chapter, the NYSDEC and the federal
government.
(2) The fee assessed to the significant and nonsignificant industrial
users for industrial pretreatment program costs incurred by the
City shall be determined in accordance with the Industrial
Pretreatment Program Charge Formula (as appended to this
chapter113).
A. The City of Fulton may enter into special agreements with users to
accept wastes of unusual volume, strength or characteristic, provided
that such wastes would not result in the violation of applicable POTW
treatment standards or requirements. Special sewer charges may be
assigned to such discharges if accepted by the Common Council, after
appropriate study and engineering and legal consultation. [Amended
10-5-1999 by L.L. No. 11-1999]
B. The sewer service charge assigned to any property owner who is not
connected to the public water supply shall be established by the
Common Council. Such sewer service charges shall be based on the
estimated or measured volume of sewage contributed to the public
sewers by such property owner and computed as stated in Subsection D
below.
C. The sewer service charge assigned to any property owner with both a
public and private water supply, whose contribution of sewage to the
public sewers exceeds the volume of public water consumed by that
owner as evidenced by this water bill, shall be established by the
Common Council. Such sewer service charge shall be based on the
estimated or measured volume of sewage entering the public sewers
and computed as stated in Subsection D below.
D. A sewer service charge assigned to any property owner who is not
connected to the public water supply or any property owner with both a
public and private water supply may be based on the measured volume

of sewage entering the public sewers upon prior written approval of
the City if requested by the property owner. If the volume of discharge
shall be used to determine the sewer service charge, the sewer service
charge to the user shall be computed by multiplying the measured
volume of sewage discharged into the sewer system by the applicable
sewer service charge rate(s) set forth in § 514-53. In the event of a
malfunction of the measuring device, the sewer service charge shall
be computed on the basis of a reasonable estimate of the volume of
sewage discharged into the sewer system during the quarter, taking
into account the volume of sewage discharged in a comparable prior
period.
E. All property owners who are outside the City limits and who, by their
own request, are served by sanitary sewers must pay sewer service
charges on a fair-user basis, equivalent to those paid by property
owners within City limits. All users, whether within or outside the City
limits, who connect to the City sewer system shall be required to pay a
connection fee, as determined by the City. [Amended 11-7-1996 by
L.L. No. 15-1996]
A. Users with wastewater discharges which do not categorize the user as a
significant industrial user as per the definition contained in Chapter
514, Article I, § 514-2, of this chapter are considered to be domestic/
commercial/nonsignificant industrial users for purposes of sewer
service charges. A minimum flat-rate sewer service charge of $21 per
three months shall be levied for domestic/commercial/nonsignificant
industrial users with less than 5,000 gallons per three months, as long
as service remains connected to the City sewers. [Amended
10-18-2016114]
B. Users with wastewater discharges which categorize the user as a
"significant industrial user" as per the definition contained in Chapter
514, Article I, § 514-2, of this chapter are considered to be significant
industrial users for purposes of sewer service charges.
C. Measurement of volume of significant industrial waters or wastes
contributed to the City POTW shall be accomplished on a continuous
basis. Volume data collected by or transmitted to the enforcement
officer by the significant industrial users shall be used to determine
average daily flow rate. Sampling of significant industrial waters or
wastes and subsequent analysis shall be accomplished a minimum of
once every month by the enforcement officer or his duly authorized
representative. Sampling data thus collected by the enforcement officer
and sampling data submitted to the City by significant industrial users
114. Editor’s Note: This resolution provided an effective date of 3-31-2017.
§ 514-54 CHARTER § 514-55
C:473
(in accordance with industrial wastewater permits) shall be used, along
with the average flow rate measurement corresponding to the period of
the sampling to compute the average daily BOD5 loading, the average
daily suspended solid loading and the average daily total phosphorus
loading of a significant industrial discharge to the POTW for use in
the user charge formula for significant industrial wastes for any given
billing period. The enforcement officer shall provide copies of industrial
sampling results to the SIU from which samples are collected upon
receipt of this information. If a particular user requests that the
enforcement officer conduct more frequent sampling, such sampling
will be done and the cost thereof, as determined by the enforcement
officer, shall be borne by said user. Split samples may be requested by
an industrial user, as specified in § 514-41.

§ 514-59. Penalties for offenses.
A. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter or who
fails to perform any duty imposed by this chapter or any other order of
determination of the enforcement officer promulgated under this
chapter or the terms of any permit issued thereunder shall be liable to
the City for a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000. Each violation shall be
a separate and distinct violation and, in the case of a continuing
violation, each day's continuance thereof shall be deemed a separate
and distinct violation. Such penalty may be recovered in an action
brought by the City Attorney at the request of the enforcement officer in
the name of the City in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such civil
penalty may be released or compromised by the enforcement officer
before the matter has been referred to the City Attorney, and, where
such matter has been referred to the City Attorney, any such penalty
may be released or compromised and any action commenced to recover
the same may be settled and discontinued by the City Attorney with the
consent of the enforcement officer. [Amended 10-5-1999 by L.L. No.

notice, in writing wherever practicable or in such other form as
practices are intended to be prescribed, to discontinue, abate or

exists, shall be indemnified against any personal liability that may arise
in the performance of his duties to protect the public health, safety or
welfare or preserve the public sewer system.

unsatisfactory to the Clerk/Chamberlain and if a corrected or sufficient
return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice from
the Clerk/Chamberlain or if no return is made for any period, the Clerk/
Chamberlain shall determine the amount of tax due from such information
he is able to obtain and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of
external indices or otherwise. The Clerk/Chamberlain shall give notice of
such determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination

decision shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be
reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited
with the Clerk/Chamberlain and an undertaking filed with him, in such
amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall
approve, to the effect that if such proceeding (order) be dismissed or the
tax confirmed, the applicant (for the order) will pay all costs and charges
which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding, or at the option
of the applicant, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the
tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which event the
applicant shall not be required to pay such tax, interest and penalties as a
condition precedent to the granting of such order.

§ 556-7. Notification.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this article, or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 556-8. Penalties for offenses. [Amended 12-1-2009 by L.L. No.

month of delay or fraction thereof, except the first month, after such return
was required to be filed or such tax became due, but the Clerk/Chamberlain
of the City of Fulton, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all
or any portion of such penalty.
§ 556-9. Refunds. [Amended 10-30-1991 by L.L. No. 4-1991;
12-1-2009 by L.L. No. 6-2009]
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof
shall make application for a refund thereof and the Clerk/Chamberlain or
the court shall determine such tax or penalty or any portion thereof was
erroneously or illegally collected, the Clerk/Chamberlain shall refund the
amount so determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund
may be so made on the initiative of the Clerk/Chamberlain. However, no
refund may be so made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination
of the Clerk/Chamberlain as hereinbefore provided unless the Clerk/
Chamberlain, after hearing as hereinbefore provided, or of his own motion,
shall have reduced the tax penalty or it shall have been established in
a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of
the State of New York that such determination was erroneous or illegal.
All refunds shall be made out of moneys collected under this article. An
application for a refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed
an application for the revision of any tax or penalty complained of and the
Clerk/Chamberlain may receive additional evidence with respect thereto.
After making his determination, the Clerk/Chamberlain shall give notice
thereof to the person interested, and he shall be entitled to an order to
review such determination under said Article 78, subject to the provision
hereinbefore contained relating to the granting of such order.

of the City of Fulton, bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The
proceeds of any judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the
Clerk/Chamberlain of the City of Fulton. Each such tax and penalty shall be
a lien upon the property of the person liable to pay the same, in the same
manner and to the same extent that the tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a
of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 556-12. Administration. [Amended 12-1-2009 by L.L. No. 6-2009]

was paid by the applicant for the credit or refund directly to the
State Tax Commission, to qualify for such refund or credit, such
tangible personal property must be incorporated into real property
as required in Subsection A(1)(a) above, reshipped as required in
Subsection A(1)(b) above or used in the manner described in
Subsection A(1)(c) or (d) above within three years after the date
such tax was payable to the State Tax Commission by such

(5) With respect to a sale or use described in Subsection A(1)(c) above,
the purchaser or user shall be entitled to a refund or credit of the
amount of the taxes imposed by this article if enacted later than the
date of such contract or bid, or of the amount reflecting an increase
in the rate of tax enacted later than said date, as the case may be,
but only to the extent that all such sales and use taxes paid on such
sale or use under the aggregate statewide and local taxes imposed
under Article 28 and by authority of Article 29 exceeded an amount
computed by applying against such sale or use the aggregate of the
rates of statewide and local sales and use taxes that were in effect
at the time such contract was entered into or such bid was
submitted. [Added 2-18-1969]

imposed by Article 28 of the Tax Law and under this article, and paid on

§ 556-33. Enforcement of collection procedures.
§ 556-34. Payment of delinquent taxes in installments. [Added

A. Pursuant to § 1104, Subdivision 1, of the Real Property Tax Law, from
January 1, 1995, and thereafter, the City of Fulton elects to adopt Title 3
of Article 11 of the Real Property Tax Law for the purpose of enforcing
the collection of delinquent taxes in the said City of Fulton.
B. Pursuant to § 1104, Subdivision 1, of the Real Property Tax Law, the
City of Fulton specifically elects not to implement or adopt Title 2 of
Article 11 of the Real Property Tax Law.
C. Pursuant to § 1120, Subdivision 2, of Title 3 of the Real Property Tax
Law, the tax lien period in the City of Fulton shall be two years, except
that, for the year 1995, a tax lien owned by the said City of Fulton may
be foreclosed as provided in Title 3 of Article 11 only if said lien has
been due and unpaid for a period of at least three years from the date
on which the tax or other legal charges represented thereby became a
lien.
D. It is the goal of this Common Council to adopt and implement the
procedures outlined by the State Division of Equalization and
Assessment, while maintaining the effective present system of real
property tax collection and causing the least disruption to the property
owner(s).
E. Article 11 of the Real Property Tax Law, as amended by Chapter 602 of
the Laws of 1993, by Chapter 532 of the Laws of 1994 and by Chapter
579 of the Laws of 1995, establishes new procedures for the
enforcement of delinquent real property taxes, beginning with taxes
becoming liens on and after January 1, 1995. New § 1110 of the Real
Property Tax Law prescribes a standard redemption period of two years
after the lien date, which the City adopts, and the City specifically
declines to adopt the time periods delineated in new § 1111. [Added

and such delinquent tax lien is not eligible to be made part of the
agreement pursuant to this section;
(2) Such person is the owner of another parcel within the tax district
on which there is a delinquent tax lien, unless such delinquent tax
lien is eligible to be and is made part of the agreement pursuant to
this section;
(3) Such person was the owner of property on which there existed a
delinquent tax lien and which lien was foreclosed within three
years of the date on which an application is made to execute an

E. A property owner shall be eligible to enter into an agreement pursuant
to this section no earlier than 30 days after the delivery of the return of
unpaid taxes to the enforcing officer.
F. The amount due under an installment agreement shall be the eligible
delinquent taxes plus the interest that is to accrue on each installment
payment up to and including the date on which each payment is to be
made. The agreement shall provide that the amount due shall be paid,
as nearly as possible, in equal amounts on each payment due date. Each
installment payment shall be due on the last day of the month in which
it is to be paid.
G. Interest and penalties. Interest on the total amount of eligible
delinquent taxes, less the amount of the down payment made by the

pursuant to § 924-a of the New York Real Property Tax Law, or such
other law as may be applicable. The rate of interest in effect on the date
the agreement is signed shall remain constant during the period of the
agreement. If an installment is not paid on or before the date it is due,
interest shall be added at the applicable rate for each month, or portion
thereof, until paid. In addition, if an installment is not paid by the end of
the 15th calendar day after the payment due date, a late charge of 5%
of the overdue payment shall be added.

agreement upon:

executed pursuant to this section.
(2) In the event of a default, the tax district shall have the right to
require the entire unpaid balance, with interest and late charges,
to be paid in full. The tax district shall also have the right to enforce
the collection of the delinquent tax lien pursuant to the applicable
sections of law, special tax act, charter or local law.
§ 556-34 CHARTER § 556-34
C:533
(3) Where an eligible owner is in default and the tax district does not
either require the eligible owner to pay in full the balance of the
delinquent taxes or elect to institute foreclosure proceedings, the
tax district shall not be deemed to have waived the right to do so.
I. Notification of potential eligible owners.
(1) Within 45 days after receiving the return of unpaid taxes from the
collecting officer, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, the
enforcing officer shall notify, by first-class mail, all potential eligible
owners of their possible eligibility to make installment payments on
such tax delinquencies. The enforcing officer shall add $1 to the
amount of the tax lien for such mailing.
(2) The failure to mail any such notice or the failure of the addressee to
receive the same shall not in any way affect the validity of taxes or
interest prescribed by law with respect thereto.
(3) The enforcing officer shall not be required to notify the eligible
owner when an installment is due.
J. Where an installment agreement so provides, the lien or liens to which
the agreement relates may be sold to the State of New York Municipal
Bond Bank Agency, or a tax lien entity created thereby, pursuant to Title
5 of Article 11 of the New York Real Property Tax Law. In case of such a
sale, the rights and duties of the tax district under the agreement shall
be assumed by the tax lien purchaser. The tax lien purchaser shall
continue to allow the owner or owners to make installment payments in
the amounts and at the times called for by the agreement, as they did
prior to the sale to the tax lien purchaser. However, such payments shall
be made to the tax lien purchaser or its tax collection agent, rather than
to the tax district, unless the tax district and the tax lien purchaser have
agreed otherwise.
K. The provisions of this section shall not affect the tax lien against the
property except that the lien shall be reduced by the payments made
under an installment agreement, and that the lien shall not be
foreclosed during the period of installment payments, provided that
such installment payments are not in default.

receive an exemption pursuant to § 458. The Assessor shall recompute
all exemptions granted pursuant to this section by multiplying the
amount of each such exemption by the cumulative change in level of

roll immediately preceding the assessment roll on which exemptions
were first granted pursuant to § 458-a; provided, however, that if an

later assessment roll, the cumulative change in level factor to be used
in recomputing the exemption shall be measured from the assessment

§ 601-1. Findings.
The outdoor storage of abandoned, junked, and discarded motor vehicles
upon public and private property within the City of Fulton, except in a
permitted and orderly manner, constitutes a blight upon the City of Fulton
and presents a peril to the safety in that they are replete with dangerous
materials, including broken glass, sharp and torn metals, gasoline and
other hazardous materials, are an attractive nuisance to children, and tend
to depreciate not only the property on which they reside, but also other
properties in the neighborhood and within the City of Fulton generally. The

deficiency or failure in the supply of water or in the pressure, for any
cause whatsoever. However, the City shall try to give notice of the
shutting off of water supplies when time and conditions permit.
G. The City water system furnishes water and not pressure and does not

or four feet as above designated, in the sound discretion of the Water
Department; then and in that event the right to effect greater sanitary

has been given by the Water Department to do so, or in the event that
the customer has failed to install a meter in connection with the premises
being served through the waste system by the date fixed as the final date
for making connections, unless said date is extended by public action and
notice, the Water Department shall have the right to remedy the violation
at the expense of the customer and charge therefor in addition to a service
charge and shall be a lien prior to and superior to every other lien or claim
except the lien of an existing tax or local assessment upon real property of
said owners so served with water from the date said work is done until it is
paid. The bill shall be submitted for the same immediately after the work is
completed, and if it is not paid within 10 days, such amount shall be added

§ 624-17. Meters.
(5) Inform the person to whom it is directed of his or her right to apply
for an administrative hearing before the Commissioner of Public
Works or his designated representative, within the shortest period
of time given to correct any violation in said notice. When a request
for such administrative hearing is requested, the Commissioner

provision of this article.
D. It shall be sufficient service to a notice and order of the Commissioner if

A. Purpose and legislative determination. The City of Fulton finds that the
protection of the public health, safety and welfare requires the
establishment of the City of Fulton Water Conservation Program. Such
program is designed to accomplish the following goals:
(1) Conserve existing water resources.
(2) Provide sound fiscal management of the City of Fulton water supply
by controlling pumping, treatment and delivery costs.
(3) Control growth in the amount of sewage requiring treatment and
disposal, given existing treatment and disposal capabilities.
(4) Control growth in sewage treatment and disposal costs and provide
for reasonable limitations on increased environmental impacts
resulting from such sewage flow increases.
A. All water used on any premises or for any purpose whatever shall be
metered. No bypass or connection, including but not limited to
bleeders, shall be made or maintained unless covered by a meter. Only
meters which have been furnished or approved by the City shall be
installed. The City Water Department shall determine the type and size
of meter in each instance.
B. The meter(s) shall be installed within the building to be served as close
as practical to the point where the service pipe enters the building by
an outside wall and shall be set with the inlet and outlet in a horizontal
line, with the register on top, and shall be located so as to be readily
accessible at all times for reading, inspection and repair. Stop valves
shall be provided on both inlet and outlet sides of the meter.
§ 624-15 FULTON CODE § 624-17
C:658
C. In the event of a discrepancy between the water consumption as
indicated by the remote reading device and the water consumption as
measured by the water meter, the water consumption as measured by
the water meter shall be controlling.
D. Outside meter pits may be installed in special cases, on written
approval of the City Water Department. Such meter pits must be
installed in accordance with City specifications and at the expense of
the property owner.
E. No T-fitting or other fitting through which water may be drawn shall be
used or placed between the main and the meter. The Commissioner or
agent may, at any reasonable time, enter upon the premises for the
purpose of inspecting pipes, take meter readings or check the operation
of the water meter and shall discontinue the supply of water when the
customer has failed to comply with Water Department rules and
regulations or for nonpayment of water bills.
F. All meters will be tested before being set. Meters furnished by other
parties will not be recognized unless they have been first tested by the
Water Department and a special permit has been given.
G. If the meter is not placed in an accessible place, the water supply will
be turned off by the Water Department and will be turned on at the
owner's expense when the meter is reset in an accessible position.

A. Department.
§ 624-26 FULTON CODE § 624-28
C:664
(1) On new installations, the Department will provide on-site
evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type
of backflow preventer, if any, that will be required, will issue
permits and perform inspection and testing. In any case, a
minimum of a dual check valve will be required in any new
residential construction. Testing must be performed annually by a
certified tester at the expense of the owner of the facility.
(2) For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the
Department will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/
or premises and inform the owner by letter of any corrective action
deemed necessary, the method of achieving the correction and the
time allowed for the correction to be made. Ninety days will be
allowed for the correction; however, this time period may be
shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved and the
history of the device(s) in question.
(3) The Department will not allow any cross-connection to remain
unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer for which
a permit has been issued and which will be regularly tested to
ensure satisfactory operation.
(4) The Department shall inform the owner, by letter, of any failure to
comply by the time of the first reinspection. The Department will
allow an additional 15 days for the correction. In the event that the
owner fails to comply with the necessary correction by the time of
the second reinspection, the Department will inform the owner, by
letter, that the water service to the owner's premises will be
terminated within a period not to exceed five days. In the event that
the owner informs the Department of extenuating circumstances as
to why the correction has not been made, a time extension may be
granted by the Department by means of an administrative
agreement, but in no case will exceed an additional 30 days.
(5) If the Department determines at any time that a serious threat to
the public health exists, the water service will be terminated
immediately.
(6) The Department shall have on file a list of New York State certified
backflow preventer device testers, who are qualified to conduct
such testing. All charges for these tests will be paid by the owner of
the building or property.
(7) The Department will begin initial premises inspections to
determine the nature of existing or potential hazards, following the
approval of this program by the Commission and Common Council,
during the calendar year 2001. Initial focus will be on high-hazard
industries and commercial premises.
(8) The Department will maintain a test result database and will notify
owners of the need to retest installed devices.
§ 624-28 CHARTER § 624-28
C:665
(9) The Department will disseminate information about the crossconnection
program to interested customers and water consumers.
(10) The Department will have the authorization to charge a permit fee
for the installation and renewal of permits for devices. The
Department is also authorized to charge based on a fee schedule
that will be evaluated on a yearly basis.
B. Owner.
(1) The owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of
all cross-connections on the premises.
(2) The owner, after having been informed by a letter from the
Department, shall, at his expense, install, maintain and test, or
have tested, any and all backflow preventers on his premises.
Testing shall be performed annually at the cost of the owner, and
the testing reports shall be mailed to the Department within 30
days of the test.
(3) The owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow preventer
which is revealed by periodic testing.
(4) The owner shall inform the Department of any proposed or
modified cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections
of which the owner is aware but have not been found by the
Department.
(5) The owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow preventer
unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the
bypass. Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the
device(s) must supply additional devices necessary to allow testing
to take place. All such devices shall be approved by the Department
prior to testing.
(6) The owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved
by the Department.
(7) The owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by the
Department or the Commissioner.
(8) Any owner having a private well or other private water source must
have a permit if the well or source is cross-connected to the
Department's system. Permission to cross-connect may be denied
by the Department. The owner may be required to install a
backflow preventer at the service entrance if a private water
source is maintained, even if it is not cross-connected to the
Department's system.
(9) In the event that the owner installs plumbing to provide potable
water for domestic purposes, which is on the Department's side of
the backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow
preventer installed.
§ 624-28 FULTON CODE § 624-28
C:666
§ 624-29. Degree of hazard.
The Department recognizes the threat to the public water system arising
from cross-connections. All threats will be classified by degree of hazard
and will require the installation of approved reduced-pressure-principle
backflow prevention devices or double-check valves.
§ 624-30. Permits.
The Department shall not permit a cross-connection within the public water
supply system unless it is considered necessary and it cannot be eliminated.
§ 624-31. Existing backflow prevention devices.
Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the Department to
continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the
effectiveness of the present backflow preventer or result in an unreasonable
risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in
the case of residential installation converting to a business establishment,
any existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to a reduced-pressureprinciple
device, or a reduced-pressure-principle device must be installed in
the event that no backflow device was present.
§ 624-32. Periodic testing.
(10) The owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
permits, annual or semiannual device testing and retesting in the
case that the device fails to operate correctly.
A. Cross-connection permits that are required for each backflow
prevention device are obtained from the Department. A fee of $50 will
be charged for the initial permit and $25 for the renewal of each permit.
B. Permits shall be renewed every five years and are nontransferable.
Permits are subject to revocation and become immediately revoked if
the owner should so change the type of cross-connection or degree of
hazard associated with the service.
A. Reduced-pressure-principle backflow devices for high-hazard crossconnections
shall be tested and inspected at least semiannually. All lowhazard
backflow prevention devices shall be inspected and tested
annually.
B. Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be
repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of
the repair the device will be retested at the owner's expense to ensure
correct operation. High-hazard situations will not be allowed to
continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot
be repaired immediately. In other situations, a compliance date of not
more than 30 days after the test date will be established. The owner is
responsible for spare parts, repair tools or a replacement device.
§ 624-28 CHARTER § 624-32
C:667
§ 624-33. Penalties for offenses.
Any person, association, partnership, firm or corporation violating any of
the provisions of this article shall be deemed guilty of a violation and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be fined in an amount not exceeding $250 or shall
be imprisoned in the Oswego County Jail for a period not exceeding 15 days,
or shall be both fined and imprisoned.
Parallel installation of two devices is an effective means of the owner
ensuring that uninterrupted water service during testing or repair of
devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such
continuity.
C. Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than
specified in Subsection A above in cases where there is a history of test
failures and the Department feels that, due to the degree of hazard
involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests
will be borne by the owner.

person is solely and exclusively responsible for determination of his/her
property line(s).

(2) Where the side or rear yard of a lot abuts a side or rear yard of a lot
in a more restricted district, there shall be provided along such
abutting line or lines a side or rear yard equal in depth to that

skylights, water tanks and necessary mechanical appurtenances usually
carried above the roof level, not to flagpoles, monuments, transmission

ARTICLE XII
Special Use Permits
[Added 4-1-2008 by L.L. No. 3-2008]
§ 640-71. Application of provisions.
When required by this chapter, special uses are considered to be uses
which may be appropriate in the zoning district in which they are located
but which possess special characteristics which may pose land use or
nuisance concerns or difficulties if controlled only by the district regulation
applicable to permitted uses.
§ 640-72. Authorization to grant or deny special uses.
Uses designated in this chapter as permitted special uses shall be
permitted, enlarged or altered upon approval of the Fulton Common Council
in accordance with the standards and procedures specified in this article.
In permitting a special use, the Council may impose, in addition to the
regulations and standards expressly specified by this article, other
conditions found necessary to protect the health and welfare of the
surrounding property or neighborhood or the City as a whole. Change in
use, expansion or contraction of the site area or alteration of structures or
uses classified as special uses, existing prior to the effective date of this
article, shall conform to the regulations pertaining to special uses. If the site
is found inappropriate for the use requested, the Council may deny approval
of the special use.
§ 640-73. Special uses subject to special permit.
Uses requiring a special permit are identified as special uses in each zoning
district. Special uses are those that are allowed but are required to meet
specific standards to ensure that the proposed development is compatible
with surrounding uses. In granting such a permit, the Council may specify
appropriate conditions, modifications and requirements to ensure
compatibility. The written decision of the Council, listing the conditions and
votes of each Council member, forms the special permit.
§ 640-74. Application contents and fee.
A request for a special use permit shall be submitted on an application form
available at the City Code Enforcement Office. Each application shall be
accompanied by a site plan, floor plan, and a fee established by resolution
of the Common Council to help defray the cost of handling the application,
no part of which is refundable. Applications shall be submitted to the Code
Enforcement Officer, who shall then transmit them to the Council.
§ 640-75. Public hearing; notice.
Upon the filing of an application for a special use, the Council shall set a
reasonable time and place for a public hearing to consider the application.
§ 640-71 CHARTER § 640-75
C:743
Said hearing, in accordance with New York State General City Law § 27-b,
shall be held within 62 days from the day the application is filed. The
Council shall cause notice to be published at last five days prior to the
hearing in at least one newspaper of general circulation within the City.
Each notice shall include the time, date, place, purpose of the hearing and
location of the subject proposal.
§ 640-76. Mailing of notice to applicant and County Planning
Board.
At least 10 days before such hearing, the Council shall mail notices thereof
to the applicant and to the County Planning Board, as required by § 239-m
of the New York State General Municipal Law, which notice shall be
accompanied by a full statement of such proposed action.
§ 640-77. Compliance with SEQRA.
The Council shall comply with the provisions of the State Environmental
Quality Review Act under Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law
and its implementing regulations.153
§ 640-78. Recess of hearing by Common Council.
The Council may recess or table an application in order to obtain additional
information which it deems to be in the best interests of the public health,
safety and welfare or necessary to assist in its decisionmaking. Upon
recessing for this purpose, the Council shall announce a time and date when
the hearing shall be resumed.
§ 640-79. Special use review criteria and findings.
The Council shall review all special use requests on the basis of both
architectural review and site plan review criteria and shall also review and
determine that the use as proposed on the specific lot location will generally
satisfy the following criteria:
A. The physical conditions and characteristics, topography and other
features of the lot and the scale and physical design and other features
of any new or existing buildings to be occupied by the use are suitable
and adaptable for the proposed use without any modifications which
would change the established character of the street or neighborhood
setting. The property lines, easements, parking areas and other paved
surfaces, loading areas, sidewalks, driveways, grading, trees, utility
poles, streetlights, traffic signals and pavement markings should be
illustrated on a survey.
B. The nature and intensity of operation of the use will not be more
objectionable to surrounding properties than those of a permitted use.
Examples of measures of potential impacts due to the nature and
153. Editor's Note: See New York State Environmental Conservation Law § 8-0101 et seq.
§ 640-75 FULTON CODE § 640-79
C:744
§ 640-80. Authority to impose additional conditions and
requirements.
intensity of development include, but are not limited to, traffic
generation, hours of operation, size and scale, noise, odor, dust,
vibration, glare, smoke and environmental hazards.
C. The use is not in such proximity to a religious facility, school,
community center, recreation place, or other prominent place of
community activity and public assembly so as to regularly conflict with
such other activity and thereby constitute a danger to health, safety and
general welfare.
D. The use will not unreasonably increase or introduce traffic congestion
or safety hazards or impose traffic volumes on streets and street
patterns which are deficient in width, design, sight distance,
intersection configuration, or other typical standards necessary to
accommodate such traffic changes.
E. The use makes adequate provision for off-street parking in accordance
with this chapter.
F. The use and the proposed design of the building and other structures
and site facilities for the use are appropriate in the proposed location
and have incorporated reasonable efforts to harmonize with
surrounding uses and mitigate any adverse impacts on surrounding
uses, including but not limited to traffic congestion and hazards,
untimely scheduling of activities, removal of trees and other established
natural features, excessive stormwater runoff, noise, nuisance, odors,
glare or vibration.
G. The cumulative impacts of the use in the proposed location will not
unreasonably interfere with or diminish the continued use,
preservation, stability, value, enjoyment, prosperity or growth of the
neighborhood or community. In evaluating cumulative impacts, the
Council will consider the proximity of other special uses, particularly
those similar to the use proposed.
H. Information shall be provided to evaluate the existing and proposed
grading shown with two-foot contour intervals and spot elevations at
critical points. A stormwater pollution control plan is required for sites
that disturb one acre or more. An erosion and sediment control plan will
also be required, if deemed necessary.
I. The use will not conflict in any way with the City of Fulton
Comprehensive Plan.
J. Outdoor storage of equipment and materials is prohibited.
K. Temporary storage buildings, trailers, PODS®, and mobile homes are
prohibited.
§ 640-79 CHARTER § 640-80
C:745
§ 640-81. Decision and notification.
Within 62 days from the date of any public hearing, the Council shall
render a decision. For purposes of this section, a decision shall be deemed
rendered upon the written permit being signed by the Council. No later than
five days following the rendering of the decision of the Council granting
or denying the application, the applicant and parties of record shall be
notified of the decision in writing. Such written notification shall include
the findings of fact for denial or approval, whichever is applicable. The
Council shall file the decision in the City Clerk/Chamberlain's office within
five business days after the day it is rendered. The Council will also retain in
its files a copy of each decision, which files shall be available for inspection
by the public.
§ 640-82. Specific property restriction.
Any special use permit, if granted, shall pertain only to the specific property
for which the application was made. Such granted permit does not apply to
any other property the applicant may control.
A. The Council may impose conditions on a special use in its issuance of a
special permit which, in its opinion, are reasonable and necessary to
promote the safety, health and general welfare of the community,
including preservation of the general character of the neighborhood in
which the use is located. By way of illustration and not limitation, such a
condition could restrict the hours of operation of any special use.
B. If the Council determines that proposed change or modification to an
existing special use is substantial, the Council shall hold a public
hearing as if for a new special use. A change or modification shall be
deemed substantial if the proposal significantly changes the use,
design, character or potential impacts of the existing lot or structure.
C. The Council reserves the right to review any special use permit and may
require an annual report for any special use to ensure that the use is in
compliance with all applicable requirements of this chapter and
conditions of approval.
D. Upon determination by the Council that there are sufficient grounds to
warrant a review, the Council may initiate a review of the operation of
any previously approved special use and may call for a public hearing to
determine that the use is in compliance with applicable standards and
conditions. Findings of noncompliance will result in the property
owners being required to submit a compliance schedule and to fully
comply within 45 days, or a shorter period of time if the Council
determines there is cause for emergency action. Any further violations
will result in revocation of the special use permit.
§ 640-80 FULTON CODE § 640-83
C:746
§ 640-83. Expiration of permit.
In the event that a special use has not been implemented within one year
from the date of the meeting wherein the special use was approved by the
Council, then such permit shall automatically lapse and be null and void.
§ 640-84. Application resubmittal.
An application which has been denied by the Council shall not be
resubmitted to the Council within six months of the date of denial. In order
for a resubmitted application to be considered by the Council, the applicant
must show, to the satisfaction of the Council, that the events, facts or
circumstances of the previously heard application have changed, thereby
warranting submission or reconsideration of a subsequent application.

B. Two lab technicians/samplers. The lab technicians/samplers sample
industries assigned by the Pretreatment Coordinator, analyze samples
for pollutant levels, send samples to an independent laboratory for
analysis whenever necessary, maintain sampling equipment and help
the Pretreatment Coordinator with industrial inspections.
C. Water and Sewer Commissioner. The Water and Sewer Commissioner
transmits severe violations to the City Attorney when legal advice or
intervention becomes necessary.
D. City Attorney. The City Attorney handles legal enforcement when phone
calls, NOVs, administrative orders, compliance schedules and fines fail.
A. All reports required of the permittee are immediately reviewed upon
receipt by the Pretreatment Coordinator. The Pretreatment Coordinator
is the first person to open and review a report. In his absence, a
pretreatment lab technician will be assigned these duties.
B. Self-monitoring reports are due by the 25th day of the month following
the month sampled. This is a provision of the wastewater discharge
permit, and a late report is considered a violation. Progress and
compliance reports which have deadlines are also covered in the
permit. In order to ensure timely receipt of these reports, the
Escalating Enforcement Response Guide calls for a phone call to the
160. Editor's Note: See Ch. 514, Sewers.
§ A701-18 CHARTER § A702-2
C:769
§ A702-3. Enforcement procedures.
permittee on the day following the deadline. If the report is late due to
circumstances beyond the control of the permittee, they will be given
more time, but a new deadline will be scheduled during the phone
conversation. In this case, if it is possible for the contracted lab to
fax the monitoring results to the Pretreatment Coordinator, this will
be done. If there is no reasonable excuse for the late report or if the
permittee fails to meet the new deadline given them, then an NOV
will be issued by the Pretreatment Coordinator within two days of the
deadline.
C. Failure by the permittee to respond to the NOV in writing within 15
days will result in a notice of significant noncompliance (NSNC) being
issued by the Pretreatment Coordinator within two days of the fifteenday
deadline. Along with the NSNC, the permittee shall be assessed a
fine of $300 per day from the original due date of the report until the
date the report is received by the Pretreatment Coordinator.
D. If a self-monitoring report shows a violation of the discharge permit, the
Pretreatment Coordinator or his replacement will document and
respond to the violation within two days. Within two days, the violator
will be contacted by phone or in person to notify them of the violation
and demand a resample or the pretreatment lab tech will resample in
their place.
E. Follow-up responses for continuing or recurring violations will be taken
within 60 days of the initial enforcement response.
F. Violations which may threaten health, property or the environment are
immediately responded to by the Pretreatment Coordinator, a lab
technician and in some instances the Water and Sewer Commissioner.
The discharge will be immediately halted and other appropriate
enforcement responses shall be taken within 30 days.
A. Under Article X of the City of Fulton Sewer Use Ordinance (SUO),161 the
enforcement officer (Pretreatment Coordinator), after discovering that
there has been a violation of the SUO or, in the case of permitted
industries, the industrial wastewater discharge permit, shall give notice
to the violator outlining the violation and ordering remedial action to be
taken. This notice and order to remedy can be in any of the following
forms.
B. The purpose of these enforcement procedures is to help the City of
Fulton pretreatment personnel in enforcement of industrial wastewater
discharge limits which are either issued in the industrial wastewater
discharge permits, set by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency for categorical industries or listed in the City of Fulton Sewer
Use Ordinance.

§ A702-2 FULTON CODE § A702-3
C:770
§ A702-4. Levels of response.
§ A702-5. Use of Enforcement Response Guide.
The use of the Enforcement Response Guide shall be to:
§ A702-6. Definitions of enforcement responses.
C. For any violations found by either the pretreatment program's
industrial monitoring program or by the industry's self-monitoring, the
Pretreatment Coordinator shall review the violation and determine the
appropriate response to be taken.
D. The enforcement action will depend on the violation's severity, duration
and effect on the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) and
environment as well as the industry's compliance history. The
Enforcement Response Plan includes a range of informal and formal
responses to violations.
A. The informal enforcement response may be a telephone call, inspection,
informal meeting or a notice of violation to the industrial user.
B. A formal response may be an administrative order, civil suit, criminal
suit or termination of service, depending on the severity of the
violation, its duration and effect on the POTW and environment and the
industrial user's compliance history.
C. If the violation is infrequent, isolated and causes no harm to the POTW
or the environment, the violation may be considered insignificant. An
insignificant violation would justify an informal response. A recurring
insignificant violation would require a formal response. If the violation
is significant, the pretreatment program personnel will determine the
most appropriate formal enforcement response.
D. A violation which is recurring, frequent and causes harm to the POTW
or the environment will be considered a significant violation. A
significant violation will merit a formal enforcement response. This
response will be proportionate to the violation's severity, promote
compliance in a timely manner and adhere to the City's Sewer Use
Ordinance.162
A. Locate the type of violation by the heading.
B. Identify the most accurate description of the violation.
C. Assess the appropriateness of the recommended enforcement response.
D. If the industrial user's response is not received or the violations
continue, follow up with escalated enforcement action.
162. Editor's Note: See Ch. 514, Sewers.
§ A702-3 CHARTER § A702-6
C:771
A. Informal response. An informal response can be an inspection, a phone
call, an informal meeting or a notice of violation to the industry in
violation. Normally, an informal response will require the industry to
resample and test for the violated parameter, or the pretreatment
program may resample and test. This response will be taken within two
days of detection of the violation.
B. Notice of violation (NOV). The NOV can be a letter or documented
phone call within two days after the violation is noted. The NOV will be
sent by certified mail or hand delivered to the industry contact person.
A response from the industry will be required within 15 days. The
industry will be required to explain the violation and provide a schedule
for correcting the violation within 15 days. If the Pretreatment
Coordinator receives no written response within 15 days of the delivery
of the NOV to the industry or the Pretreatment Coordinator considers
the response to be inadequate for the nature of the violation, then a
notice of significant noncompliance (NSNC) will be issued.
C. Notice of significant noncompliance (NSNC). A notice of significant
noncompliance will be sent by certified mail or hand delivered within
five days of determination of its need. A written response will be
required within 10 days. The industry will be required to explain in full
a previous response that was found to be inadequate or why no
response at all was sent to the NOV. If it is deemed feasible by the
Pretreatment Coordinator that compliance can be achieved within 30
days or less, then the NSNC will require that a thirty-day schedule of
compliance be sent with the industry's response. If the industry
indicates that attaining compliance with its permit limits will take
longer than 30 days, a consent order could be negotiated. If the
Pretreatment Coordinator does not receive a response to the NSNC
within 10 days, the industry will then be issued a second NSNC.
D. Notice to show cause. If an industry fails to respond to an NOV or
NSNC, the Pretreatment Coordinator may issue a notice to show cause,
which is an administrative order requiring the industry to appear at a
designated time and place to explain why compliance has not been
achieved and show cause why more severe enforcement procedures
should not be taken.
E. Second notice of significant noncompliance. A second notice of
significant noncompliance will be sent by certified mail or delivered by
the Pretreatment Coordinator within five days after the required
response date of the first notice of significant noncompliance. The
second NSNC will carry an administrative fine of $1,000 per day per
violation. The only acceptable response from an industry at this point
shall be payment of the fine and a request for a consent order. Response
to the second NSNC will be required within 10 days.
F. Compliance schedule. A compliance schedule is an administrative
order, issued by the Pretreatment Coordinator, by which the violator
agrees to be bound. The violator may request a compliance schedule or
§ A702-6 FULTON CODE § A702-6
C:772
§ A702-7. Escalating Enforcement Response Guide.
the Pretreatment Coordinator may determine that one is necessary.
Once the decision is made to use a compliance schedule, the
Pretreatment Coordinator will schedule a compliance meeting between
the violator and the pretreatment personnel to negotiate an enforceable
compliance schedule.
G. Compliance meeting.
(1) A compliance meeting is a meeting between the industry
representatives and pretreatment personnel to explain the
violation to the industry and draft a remedial plan to bring the
industry into compliance with its discharge permit. A letter is used
to explain the problem and arrange the compliance meeting with
the industry. The meeting will cover the following:
(a) The nature of the violation.
(b) Permit regulations.
(c) Previous violations.
(d) Effects of the violation.
(e) Causes of the violation.
(f) Steps to be taken to prevent recurrence of the violation.
(g) Schedule for remedial steps.
(2) The schedule for remedial steps will be drafted at this meeting. It
may be finalized at a later date and signed by both parties.
Necessary tasks, specific time schedules and reporting
responsibilities should be determined at the meeting. Finalization
of the consent order should be completed as soon as possible, but
not more than 10 days after the meeting.
H. Termination of service. The Pretreatment Coordinator has the option to
advise the Sewer and Water Commissioner of continued noncompliance
or discharge that may be harmful to the POTW or environment, and a
decision may be made by both to terminate either water or sewer
service, or both, to the violating industry.
I. Judicial actions. Civil actions can be taken when an industry is unlikely
to successfully execute the steps that are necessary to achieve
compliance, when the violation is severe enough to warrant such action
or when there is an immediate danger presented by an industry's
noncompliance. A civil action may be used to recover costs of damages
and labor associated with the violation, including any penalties paid for
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) violations by
the POTW.
