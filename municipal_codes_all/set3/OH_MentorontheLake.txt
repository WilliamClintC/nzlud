207.01   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Credit cards are purchasing tools, which offer an alternative to the
existing City of Mentor on the Lake purchasing process. They provide an
extremely efficient and effective method of purchasing and paying for goods and
services.
   (b)   This policy describes the procedures for the appropriate use of City
credit cards. By signing the credit card agreement form (attached to Ordinance
2019-O-04 as Appendix 1), the employee promises to comply with program
policies, rules and regulations. A credit card will be issued to an employee
upon approval by the City's Administrative Director ("Administrative Director")
and after the employee executes a signed credit card agreement form. The
employee executing the credit card agreement shall be known as the "cardholder"
as defined herein.
   (c)   All City credit cards shall be issued in the name of the "City of
Mentor on the Lake" and may also include the name of an employee. A City credit
card that also bears an employee's name on the face of it is to be utilized
only by that employee cardholder. The authorized cardholder of a City credit
card is the person that is responsible for tracking and reporting monthly
purchases to the Administrative Department. The authorized cardholder that
handles a credit card is responsible for the appropriate use of City funds. The
credit card is the property of the City of Mentor on the Lake and may be
rescinded at any time. The credit card is only to be used for the types of
purchase outlined in this policy.
   (d)   Each "custodian" (as defined herein) shall keep a current record of
transactions and receipts to protect himself/herself and the City. These
records are important internal controls elements of the electronic purchasing
process and essential to the success of the credit card program.
   (e)   Authorized cardholders under this policy are the Mayor and
Administrative Director. The credit card issued to the Administrative Director
shall be for the use of all City departments for which individual cards have
not been issued and shall be kept by the Administrative Director who shall
serve as the custodian of that credit card.
(Ord. 2019-O-04.  Passed 3-12-19.)
207.02   PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Credit cards simplify the purchasing and disbursement process by
facilitating point-of-demand procurement. Purchasing authority is delegated to
the authorized cardholder enabling him or her to place an order directly with
the supplier.
   (b)   When the supplier requests a purchase authorization, the Master Card
system validates the transaction against pre-set limits established by the
City.
   (c)   All transactions are approved or declined (instantaneously) based on
the following credit card authorization criteria:
      (1)   Number of transactions allowed per day;
      (2)   Number of transactions allowed per month;
      (3)   Single purchase limit;
      (4)   Spending limit per month; and
      (5)   Approved merchant commodity code.
   (d)   The authorization process occurs through an electronic system that
supports the credit card processing services under the City of Mentor on the
Lake agreement with the card provider. In addition, the Administrative
Department will have the capability to view transactions daily and create
reports to effectively monitor the use of the credit cards.
(Ord. 2019-O-04.  Passed 3-12-19.)
207.03   PURCHASING GUIDELINES.
   (a)   The credit card program will not circumvent the City's purchasing
rules and procedures. The credit cards will not be used in place of a purchase
order. As such, regular purchase order policy and procedures must be followed
for all credit card purchases.
   (b)   Each cardholder and card custodian is responsible for the security of
the card he/she is issued and for the purchases made with it. Consequences for
card misuse are severe and penalties may include loss of job.
   (c)   The regulations for the usage of credit cards are as follows:
      (1)   It is the responsibility of each custodian to have control over all
purchases made by his/her department or division using the credit card.
      (2)   The custodian will provide access to the credit card for approved
purchases upon receipt of a completed purchase requisition.
      (3)   The custodian must submit all requests for credit card deletions,
additions, or changes in writing to the Administrative Director.
      (4)   The authorized cardholder of the credit card is the person that is
responsible for tracking and reporting monthly purchases to the Department of
Administration.
      (5)   The card custodian shall maintain a list of authorized users. The
card custodian is responsible for ensuring that purchases made with credit
cards are within budgeted appropriations.
      (6)   The President of Council will serve as the card custodian for
credit cards issued in the name of Council members.
(Ord. 2019-O-04.  Passed 3-12-19.)
207.04   RESTRICTIONS ON CREDIT CARD USE.
   (a)   Credit cards cannot be used for the following: cash advances,
traveler's checks, personal services, capital equipment (equipment purchases
exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000)), purchases of alcoholic beverages,
tobacco purchases, and any other purchase that is not for a public purpose of
the City of Mentor on the Lake.
   (b)   Credit cards cannot be used for the following transaction types listed
below unless the Administrative Director has specifically approved the
inclusion as an approved merchant commodity code on a specific credit card:
airline tickets, automobiles and vehicle rentals, registration fees for
educational programs (conferences, seminars, forums, and continuing education),
and hotels.
   (c)   If you have any questions regarding a restricted commodity, please
contact the Administrative Director.
   (d)   Each credit card has been assigned an individual credit limit based on
the custodian's and the Administrative Director's approval. (See Appendix 2
attached to Ordinance 2019-O-04.) No single credit card purchase shall exceed
the credit limit without prior written authorization of the Administrative
Director. If that limit becomes too low to accommodate monthly requirements,
the cardholder may request an increase through the custodian to the
Administrative Director. The department or division should allow two days to
process any limit changes to a credit card.
   (e)   Certain merchants are blocked from the program and purchases through
them will be declined. If the cardholder feels that his/her purchase has been
mistakenly declined, the cardholder should contact the Administrative Director
to address the issue.
(Ord. 2019-O-04.  Passed 3-12-19.)
207.05   PLACING AN ORDER.
   When placing an order, the cardholder should be able to provide the vendor
the following credit card information:
   (a)   Identify himself/herself as a City of Mentor on the Lake cardholder
employee;
   (b)   Indicate that the purchase will be made using a credit card;
   (c)   Supply the provider card name;
   (d)   Provide the individual card number;
   (e)   Give the expiration date of the card;
   (f)   Provide the complete delivery address;
   (g)   Any other information necessary to make the purchase; and
   (h)   Never allow a vendor to maintain the credit card information for its
files.
(Ord. 2019-O-04.  Passed 3-12-19.)
207.06   ORDER VERIFICATION PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Upon receipt of an order, the documentation received from the vendor
(typically a sales receipt or packing slip) shall be kept for later
reconciliation. Each month the card custodian will receive a statement from the
card provider showing all purchases made. It is the responsibility of the card
custodian to verify each purchase.
   (b)   The card custodian is responsible for ensuring receipt of goods and
services. Items should be returned directly to the vendor by whichever means
the vendor requires. The card custodian is responsible for seeing that the
proper credit is posted for any returned items.
(Ord. 2019-O-04.  Passed 3-12-19.)
207.07   PROOF OF PURCHASE DOCUMENTATION AND RECONCILIATION.
   (a)   With the authority to purchase specific goods and services comes the
responsibility to maintain adequate documentation at the source of the
transaction. Whenever a packing slip or sales receipt is received by the
cardholder making the purchase, the sales receipt should be forwarded to the
custodian of the card as proof that the transaction occurred. The custodian
should retain this documentation until the monthly statement from the card
provider is received. Any transaction without a properly substantiated receipt
is subject to reimbursement of the City by the cardholder that made the
purchase.
   (b)   After receiving the statement from the card provider, the card
custodian will need to verify all purchases made and create a purchasing log
allocating the account(s) that will be used in order to pay for the items
purchased. The original documentation along with the correlating purchasing log
will then be sent to the Administrative Department for approval and processing.
   (c)   All documentation must support the legitimate business purpose of all
transactions made with the credit card. In addition to sales receipts and
packing slips, the following are examples of supporting documentation: copies
of order forms or applications, services reports when service is provided by a
vendor, and cash register receipts.
(Ord. 2019-O-04.  Passed 3-12-19.)
207.08   DISCREPANCIES AND DISPUTE PROCEDURES.
   (a)   The cardholder that makes the purchase is responsible for following up
with a vendor for any erroneous charges, disputed items, or returns. Disputed
charges can result from failure to receive goods or services, fraud or misuse,
altered charges, defective merchandise, incorrect amounts, duplicate charges,
credits not processed, etc. The cardholder who made the purchase should contact
the vendor first to resolve any outstanding issues.
   (b)   In the event that the cardholder who made the purchase is unsuccessful
with resolving disputes with the vendor, he/she will need to notify the card
custodian to obtain help in resolving the issue. The card custodian will then
need to contact the card provider to report the dispute. The card provider will
decide what form the card custodian will need to file in order to resolve the
dispute. Any contact made with a vendor, as well as its response, should be
attached to the form, especially noting the date that the exchange of
information occurred. The card provider also requires a date when merchandise
is returned and/or services are cancelled. Once the form is completed it shall
be returned to the card provider.
   (c)   Please note: By law, vendors are not permitted to bill a credit card
for purchases until the items have been shipped.
(Ord. 2019-O-04.  Passed 3-12-19.)
207.09   PAYMENT.
   The City of Mentor on the Lake is responsible for payment of authorized and
appropriate credit card transactions. The credit card will not affect the
cardholder's personal credit in any way.
(Ord. 2019-O-04.  Passed 3-12-19.)
207.10   LOST OR STOLEN CARDS.
   (a)   In the event that the credit card is lost or stolen, it is the
responsibility of the cardholder to report the event to the card custodian. It
is then the responsibility of the card custodian to report the card lost or
stolen by phone directly to the card issuer and also to the Administrative
Director by phone or e-mail at the time of the occurrence. It is important to
report all lost or stolen cards immediately since the City of Mentor on the
Lake will be responsible for all transactions made until the card is reported
lost or stolen.
   (b)   A cardholder's quick response will reduce the risk of fraud. A
replacement card may be issued to the card custodian within ten business days.
(Ord. 2019-O-04.  Passed 3-12-19.)
207.11   SALES TAX.
   The City of Mentor on the Lake is tax exempt. Cardholders must tell in-state
suppliers the City is exempt from Ohio sales tax. A copy of the City's Tax
Exempt Certificate is available if the supplier needs to see it. When traveling
outside of the State of Ohio, hotel charges, food charges and fuel charges will
most likely be taxed since tax exemption applies only to sales within the State
of Ohio.
(Ord. 2019-O-04.  Passed 3-12-19.)
207.12   CANCELING CREDIT CARDS.
   (a)   In order to cancel a credit card, the custodian must cut the card in
half and submit a written request to cancel the card to the Administrative
Department. The cut card is to be forwarded to the Administrative Director.
   (b)   To ensure the continued success of the credit card program, periodic
audits will be performed. The purpose of the audits will be to ensure that the
cardholders utilizing the program are adhering to authorized policies and
procedures.
   (c)   Additionally, the Assistant Administrative Director shall be the
City's compliance officer for purposes of this policy and, in such capacity,
shall report to Council on a quarterly basis, the number of cards and accounts
issued, the number of active cards and accounts issued, the cards' and
accounts' expiration dates, and the cards' and accounts' credit limits.
(Ord. 2019-O-04.  Passed 3-12-19.)
207.13   CONCLUSION.
   City credit cards must be used responsibly. Each employee should be aware
that improper use might result in disciplinary action, up to and including
termination and criminal prosecution. Even though the department or division
maintains purchasing logs, the original receipts must be forwarded to the
Administrative Department. The card may be randomly audited to track purchasing
and record keeping activity.
(Ord. 2019-O-04.  Passed 3-12-19.)

the flexibility necessary to effectively manage the investment portfolio.
   (b)   The purposes of this investment policy, in order of priority, are to
provide for the complete safety of the portfolio's principal value, to assure
adequate liquidity and to earn a market rate of return. Investments will be
made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons
of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their
own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable
safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
   (c)   The investment officer, acting in accordance with this investment
policy and exercising due diligence, shall be relieved of personal
responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price
changes. All investment activities will be undertaken by the Administrative
Director.
   (d)   The Administrative Director shall be permitted to invest only in a
security authorized by Ohio R.C.135.14 or other relevant sections of the Ohio
Revised Code, as amended. All investment procedures will be conducted as
specified in the Ohio Revised Code, including, but not limited to, the
collateralization of deposits and repurchase agreements.
   (e)   The maximum final maturity of any investment will be two years from
the date of purchase. No derivative securities of investment "pools," with the
exception of STAR Ohio, will be permitted.
   (f)   The Administrative Director will only invest inactive funds with those
financial institutions that have been approved by City Council. Investments may
be held in safekeeping by the approved financial institution.
   (g)    All transactions will be done on a competitive basis, whenever
possible. In the event that two or more dealers are tied with the lowest price,
the transactions will be awarded at the discretion of the Administrative
Director. A current portfolio report providing details of each investment will
be maintained by the Administrative Director.

   248.01   ADOPTION OF PROGRAM.
   The affirmative action program, as provided in this chapter, is hereby
adopted.
(Ord.85-0-29. Passed 11-12-85.)
   248.02   OBJECTIVE.
   The objective of this chapter is to reaffirm a policy of affirmative action
in the employment, transfer and promotion of minority and of female candidates,
so as to meet both the obligations of the laws pertaining thereto, as well as
to meet the City's obligation and desire to be a good citizen.
(Ord.85-0-29. Passed 11-12-85.)
   248.03   POLICY.
   This statement reaffirms the policy of the City to hire employees without
discrimination as to race, creed, color, sex, age or national background, or
physical handicaps not detrimental to performance or general health. All
personnel actions, including, but not necessarily restricted to, recruiting,
employment, transfer and promotional procedures, reductions in force, City-
sponsored training, benefit programs, social programs and recreational
programs, shall be administered without regard to race, creed, color, national
background, sex or age, except where sex or age is a bona fide occupational
qualification, and to correct the effects of past discrimination and to prevent
present and future discrimination.
(Ord.85-0-29. Passed 11-12-85.)
   248.04   IMPLEMENTATION.
   Successful implementation of this policy requires placement of
responsibility, communication and auditing.
   (a)   The Mayor has the responsibility of coordinating the administration of
this program throughout the City. Each department head has the responsibility
of counseling and assisting all levels of management within their respective
departments on matters relating to minority groups. Each department head shall
assist the department with its communications, with community minority groups
and with problems relating to minority employees.
   (b)   It is the responsibility of each director to prepare and submit to the
Mayor, as requested by the Mayor, a program of affirmative action for each
appropriate organization unit under the supervision of such director.
   In "Affirmative Action Guidelines, " issued as Order #4 by the Office of
Federal Contract Compliance on January 30, 1970, an "affirmative action
program" is defined as a set of specific and result-oriented procedures to
which a contractor commits himself or herself to apply every good faith effort.
The objective of those procedures, plus such efforts, is equal employment
opportunity. Procedures without effort to make them work are meaningless, and
effort, undirected by specific and meaningful procedures, is inadequate. An
acceptable affirmative action program shall include an analysis of areas within
which the contractor is deficient in the utilization of minority groups and,
further, goals and timetables to which the contractor's good faith efforts
shall be directed to correct the deficiencies, thus to increase materially the
utilization of minorities at all levels and in all segments of his or her work
force, where deficiencies exist. Hence, to fully comply with Title VII of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1964, these statements, for which each
director is responsible, shall include, but not necessarily be limited to:
      (1)    An in-depth analysis of the work force in his or her organization
unit, to include:
         A.   Ratio of minority employees to total employees in each job
category; B. Identification of each area in which minorities are
"underutilized. "
         B.   "Underutilization" is defined as having fewer minorities in a
particular job category than would reasonably be expected by their
availability.
         C.    Percentage of minority work force as compared with the total
work force in the immediate labor area;
         D.   The general availability of minorities having requisite skills in
the immediate labor area;
         E.   The availability of minorities having requisite skills in an area
in which the employer can reasonably recruit;
         F.   The availability of promotable minority employees within the
organizational unit;
         G.   Anticipated expansion, contraction and turnover of and in the
work force; and
         H.   Availability of training, both internally and externally, which
can be reasonably used to make all job classes available to minority employees.
      (2)   Goals, timetables and affirmative action commitments shall be
detailed in writing to correct deficiencies shown by the above analysis. Goals
shall be established which meet the criteria of attainability with the
expenditure of every good faith effort. Confirming data, such as seniority
rosters, applicant flow data and application rejection ratios indicating
minority status, shall be maintained. Special attention shall be directed to
the underutilization of minorities in the following six categories: officials
and managers, professionals, technicians, sales workers, office clerical and
skilled craftsmen.
      (3)   Records of all special recruiting efforts, sources utilized and
activities with local community action groups shall be maintained and resumes
of these actions submitted with each semiannual report. Plans for continued and
in creased activities of this nature shall also be Included.
   (c)   It is the responsibility of each director, superintendent and
department head to communicate this policy to all employees, especially to
those who make employment and personnel decisions. Every department shall
continue to distribute information on this policy to all new employees during
the indoctrination program.
(Ord.85-0-29. Passed 11-12-85.)

department head as soon as is practicable. The department head shall complete
the City injury report and forward a copy to the Mayor and to Payroll.
   (b)   Payment of Wages. Where an employee has been injured on duty and it
has been determined by a licensed physician that the employee will be unable to
return to his or her job assignment, the City will pay the difference between
applicable State benefits and his or her regular salary for the period
beginning on the fourth scheduled work day and ending on the seventy-fifth
calendar day from the date of injury. The first three scheduled work days shall
be charged to sick leave, unless waived by the Mayor, thereby authorizing the
three days to be charged to injury leave.
   (c)   Physicians' Reports. An injured employee shall request the attending
physician to certify to the City the employee's physical condition, his or her
anticipated date of return to a full job assignment and the date he or she may
be assigned to light duty, if practical.
   The Mayor may, at regular intervals, require written proof of continuing
disability from the employee's physician and, in some instances, may require an
examination of the employee by a physician of the Mayor's choice to determine
the extent and probable duration of the disability. Such examination will be at
City expense. If it is determined by such examination that the employee is
physically able to return to active full-time employment, the Mayor shall
promptly direct the employee to return to work on the next Monday following the
conclusion of the examination. Failure by the employee to return to work as
directed will be considered as voluntary termination, unless an appeal is filed
with the Mayor not later than the third regular business day after the notice
to return to work is received. If an appeal is filed, the employee has seven
calendar days to file a third physician's report with the Mayor. The cost of
such third opinion shall be paid by the employee. The Mayor's decision will be
final and not appealable.
   (d)   Type of Duty. When the attending physician certifies the employee's
physical condition, as specified in subsection (c) hereof, such physician shall
designate the employee's duty status as one of the following:
      (1)    Unable to perform work of any nature;
      (2)   Able to perform very-light-duty work, i. e. work which requires
minimum physical exertion and can be adapted to the particular physical
disability of the employee, including, but not limited to, answering
telephones, relaying messages, reviewing calculations, posting data, taking
inventories of equipment or supplies and filing;
      (3)   Able to perform light-duty work, i. e. work which requires
restricted physical exertion and can be adapted to the particular physical
disability of the employee, including, but not limited to, all of the
activities referred to in paragraph (d) (2) hereof, dusting furniture, light
maintenance work, cleaning equipment, sweeping floors and groundskeeping; or
      (4)   Able to work full duty, i. e. perform the regular work assignment.
   (e)   Light-Duty Assignment.
      (1)   An employee shall return to his or her respective department for
light-duty assignment.
      (2)   If no light-duty assignment is available within the employee's own
department, he or she shall report to the Mayor or Administrative Director for
assignment to another department where a light-duty assignment is available.
      (3)   If no light-duty assignment is available in any department, the
employee shall continue on injury leave.
   (f)   Injury-On-Duty Leave. Injury-on-duty leave, as specified in subsection
(b) hereof, will not be charged against sick leave. Any light-duty assignment
will be paid at the employee's normal wage rate, provided that one-third of the
light-duty time and two-thirds of the very-light-duty time worked by the
employee shall be charged against injury-on-duty leave.
   (g)   Continued Disability. If an employee's disability continues beyond
seventy-five calendar days, such employee shall apply for leave of absence as
specified in Section 250.09. Health and other related benefits shall continue
while on medical leave of absence. The Mayor shall have the authority to extend
the injury-on-duty leave for an additional seventy-five calendar days or any
part thereof, or allow such employee to charge his or her sick leave.
   (h)   Veteran Employees. For those employees who have been injured on duty
and have completed twenty-five years of service and/or become eligible for a
pension, the compensation defined in subsection (b) hereof shall cease and such
covered employee shall make application to the appropriate pension fund.

   250.23   PICK-UP OF POLICE AND FIREMEN'S DISABILITY AND PENSION FUND.
   (a)   Effective January 23, 2000, 100 percent of the statutorily required
contributions to the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund shall be
withheld from the gross pay of each person within any of the classes
established in subsection (c) hereof and shall be picked up (assumed and paid
to the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund) by the City. This
pick-up by the City is, and shall be designated as, public employee
contributions and shall be in lieu of contributions to the Police and Firemen's
Disability and Pension Fund by each person within any of the classes
established in subsection (c) hereof. No person subject to this pick-up shall
have the option of choosing to receive the statutorily required contribution to
the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund directly instead of having
it picked up by the City, or of being excluded from the pick-up.
   (b)   The City shall, in reporting and making remittance to the Police and
Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund, report that the public employee's
contribution for each person subject to this pick-up has been made as provided
by the statute.
   (c)   The pick-up by the City provided by this section shall apply to all
persons who are employees of the City and who are or become contributing
members of the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund.
   (d)   The City's method of payment of salary to employees who are
participants in the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund is hereby
modified as follows, in order to provide for a salary reduction method of pick-
up of employee contributions to the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension
Fund:
   The total salary for each employee shall be the salary otherwise payable
under the City's policies. Such total salary of each employee shall be payable
by the City in two parts: (1) deferred salary; and (2) cash salary. An
employee's deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage of that employee's
total salary which is required from time to time by the Police and Firemen's
Disability and Pension Fund to be paid as an employee contribution by that
employee, and shall be paid by the City to the Police and Firemen's Disability
and Pension Fund on behalf of that employee as a pick-up and in lieu of the
Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund employee contribution
otherwise payable by that employee.
   An employee's cash salary shall be equal to that employee's total salary
less the amount of the pick-up for that employee, and shall be payable, subject
to applicable payroll deductions, to that employee. The City shall compute and
remit its employer contributions to the Police and Firemen's Disability and
Pension Fund based upon an employee's total salary. The total combined
expenditures of the City for such employees' total salaries, payable under
applicable City policies and the pick-up provisions of this section, shall not
be greater than the amounts it would have paid for those items had this
provision not been in effect.
   (e)   The Administrative Director is hereby authorized and directed to
implement the provisions of this section to institute the pick-up of the
statutorily required contributions to the Police and Firemen's Disability and
Pension Fund for those persons referred to in subsection (c) hereof so as to
enable them to obtain the result in Federal and State tax deferments and other
benefits.

PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY
   282.10   PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY.
   (a)   Public Records.
      (1)   In accordance with the Ohio Revised Code and applicable judicial
decisions, "records" are defined as any item that: (i) contains information
stored on a fixed medium (such as paper, electronic, including but not limited
to e-mail,  and other formats); (ii) is created or received by, or sent under
the jurisdiction of a public office; and (iii) documents the organization,
functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations or other activities of
the office.
      (2)   Public records are to be open to the public at all reasonable times
with exceptions only as provided for in the law.
      (3)   As required by Ohio law, records will be organized and maintained
so that they are readily available for inspection and copying within a
reasonable period of time during regular business hours. Record retention
schedules are to be updated regularly.
   (b)   Record Requests.  Each request for public records should be evaluated
for a response using the following guidelines:
      (1)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian may contact
the requester for clarification, and should let the requestor revise the
request by informing the requester of the manner in which the office keeps its
records.
      (2)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing,
and does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is this office's general policy that if this
information is requested upon disclosure that the requester may decline to give
the information.
      (3)   Public records that are requested are to be available for
inspection during regular business hours, with the exception of published
holidays. Public records must be made available for inspection promptly. Copies
of public records must be made available within a reasonable period of time.
"Prompt" and "reasonable" take into account the volume of records requested,
the proximity of the location where the records are stored, and the necessity
for any legal review of the records requested.
      (4)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records.
      (5)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority.
   (c)   Costs for Public Records.  Those seeking public records will be
charged only the actual cost of making copies.
      (1)   There will be a charge for copies.
      (2)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is one
dollar ($1.00) per disc.
      (3)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
      (4)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
   (d)   E-mail.
      (1)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business
are subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of this office
are instructed to retain their e-mails that relate to public business (see
division (a) of this section) and to copy them to their business e-mail
accounts and/or to the office's records custodian.
      (2)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from private accounts
as records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining
them per established schedules and making them available for inspection and
copying in accordance with the Public Records Act.

   414.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.  Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence
districts, the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. 
Where two or more through highways designated under this division intersect and
no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic- control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
   414.03   TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
   414.04   SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow.  A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow.  A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
   414.05   PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one- way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic-control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the
right-hand lane to continue on the driver's intended route.
      (2)   Nothing in division (b)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver's safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic-control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under division (a)(2) of this section. This division shall
not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of the center line in making a

distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken.  In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for the

   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician- intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic” have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.  If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense.  The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. this section, "National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration" means the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration established as an administration of the United States Department
of Transportation under 96 Stat.2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma,  breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person.  The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section.  The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.

      (1)   Definitions.  As used in this section:
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device” means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section.  The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness.  Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who  otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person
if convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)
(c), (d), or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a)
or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. 
The person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request
of the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
         "You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
State law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
         "If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of
O.V.I., O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a
listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
under State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under
arrest for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will
face increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
         (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense."
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.

driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person.  Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance.  If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of
a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of

evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (4)   A.   Whoever violates division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section is

from the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar
shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration
of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into

responsibility is maintained with respect to that vehicle.
   (b)   No person shall operate any motor vehicle upon a highway or any public
or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel or
parking in this municipality if the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or temporary instruction permit or nonresident operating privilege has
been suspended pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4509.37 or 4509.40 for nonpayment of a
judgment.
   (c)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section may be admitted into evidence
as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under either a
financial responsibility law suspension at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a) of this section or a nonpayment of judgment suspension at the time
of the alleged violation of division (b) of this section. The person charged
with a violation of division (a) or (b) of this section may offer evidence to
rebut this prima facie evidence.
   (d)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of driving
under financial responsibility law suspension or cancellation and shall be
punished as provided in this division (d). Whoever violates division (b) of
this section is guilty of driving under a nonpayment of judgment suspension and
shall be punished as provided in this division (d).
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (d)(2) of this
section, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Section

698.03 or Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Section
698.02(d) or Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding Section
698.02(f)(1)B.1. and Ohio R.C. 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up
to one thousand dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding Section

pursuant to Section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up

an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss arising from an accident
or collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offender’s
operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing the offense for
which the offender is sentenced under this section.
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the order of suspension resulted from the failure of the alleged
offender to respond to a financial responsibility random verification request
under Ohio R.C. 4509.101(A)(3)(c) and that, at the time of the initial
financial responsibility random verification request, the alleged offender was
in compliance with Ohio R.C. 4509.101(A)(1) as shown by proof of financial
responsibility that was in effect at the time of that request.

admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the
motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
   (h)   This section does not apply when an emergency exists that threatens
the life of any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle that is being
used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section. This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in
this State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who
otherwise would be required to be restrained under this section has a physical
impairment that makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat or an
occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   (1)   Whoever violates division (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section
shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a
motor vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system,
booster seat or occupant restraining device as required by this section that
occurred at the same time, on the same day and at the same location is deemed
to be a single violation of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (j)(1)B. of this
section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy- five dollars
($75.00).
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of division (a), (b),(c) or (d) of this section or of a
State law or municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent any of those
divisions, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
      (2)   All fines imposed pursuant to division (j)(1) of this section shall
be forwarded to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Child Highway Safety
Fund created by Ohio R.C. 4511.81(I).

   440.01   LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The Municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
Ohio R.C. 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the State highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality.  No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the State highway
system.  The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the Municipality.  Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued.  The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee.  However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section.  If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure.  In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit.  No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Streets.  No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five
tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than state routes and County
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
state route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating such weight limits.
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating "no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons" or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit.  Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections 408.01 and 408.02.
   440.02   MAXIMUM WIDTH, HEIGHT AND LENGTH.
   (a)   No vehicle shall be operated upon the public highways, streets,

designed and used exclusively to transport a boat between a place of storage
and a marina, or in and around a marina, when drawn or towed on a street or
highway for a distance of no more than ten miles and at a speed of 25 miles per
hour or less, shall have a drawbar or other connection, including the hitch
mounted on the towing vehicle, which shall be of sufficient strength to pull
all the weight towed thereby.  Only one such vehicle used to transport
agricultural produce or agricultural production materials as provided in this
section may be towed or drawn at one time except as follows:
         A.   An agricultural tractor may tow or draw more than one such
vehicle;
         B.   A pickup truck or straight truck designed by the manufacturer to
carry a load of not less than one-half ton and not more than two tons may tow

of this section shall fail to properly mark the special parking locations in
accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of the special

   452.05   WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   Impounding Abandoned Motor Vehicle on Public Property; Notice;
Disposition.  The County Sheriff or Chief of Police, within the Sheriff’s or
Chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a State Highway Patrol trooper,
upon notification to the Sheriff or Chief of Police of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or
State Highway Patrol trooper as a result of the performance of the Sheriff’s,
Chief’s, or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Sheriff
or Chief of Police of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
However, when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may
be ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or State Highway Patrol
trooper shall allow the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to
arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified
by the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or State Highway Patrol trooper. If the
Sheriff, Chief of Police, or State Highway Patrol trooper determines that the
vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the Sheriff,
Chief of Police, or State Highway Patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered
removed.
   (b)   If the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or a State Highway Patrol trooper
issues an order under division (a) of this section and arranges for the removal
of a motor vehicle by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the
motor vehicle to the location designated by the Sheriff or Chief of Police not
more than two hours after the time it is removed.
   (c)   (1)   The Sheriff or Chief of Police shall cause a search to be made
of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the identity of the
owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the Sheriff
or Chief of Police, or by a State Highway Patrol trooper within five business
days of the removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Sheriff
or Chief of Police shall send or cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at
the owner’s or lienholder’s last known address by certified mail with return
receipt requested, notice that informs the owner or lienholder that the motor
vehicle will be declared a nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten
days of the date of mailing of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Sheriff, Chief of Police, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to
be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles has been conducted and
after notice has been sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this
section, and the search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice
was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or
lienholder shall pay to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of mailing of the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police,
without charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county
in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with
the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the
Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Sheriff or Chief of Police. If the
vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other
facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police shall execute in triplicate
an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and that all
requirements of this section have been complied with. The Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or
other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor
vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(ORC 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
Municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing
of such abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
Municipality from such disposal.

oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules

   606.02   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.

due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused departed this
Municipality or conceals the accused’s identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section apply to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015,

16, 2015, if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section

   606.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.”  Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.”  Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.”  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.”  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
   606.08   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
   606.09   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
   606.10   FALSIFICATION.

another person empowered to administer oaths.
      (7)   The statement is in writing on or in connection with a report or

offender, or to extend to or bestow upon the offender any other valuable
benefit or distinction, when the person to whom the statement is directed
relies upon it to his or her detriment.

commission of a theft offense.
      (10)   The statement is knowingly made to a probate court in connection

sheriff pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2923.125 in order to obtain or renew a concealed
handgun license or is made in an affidavit submitted to a county sheriff to
obtain a concealed handgun license on a temporary emergency basis under Ohio
R.C. 2923.1213.

with the person’s purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery

   (c)   No person, in an attempt to obtain a concealed handgun license under

of treatment or services for drug dependent persons or persons in danger of
drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a hospital,
clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider whose alcohol
and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.36.

services” include services provided in an informal setting by a person who, by

   (h)   No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to
any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.

regardless of whether the person or child aided ultimately is apprehended for,

      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of

determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
618.18 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and
“vicious dog” have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

county humane society at the owner’s expense.
         B.   If the court does not order the vicious dog to be destroyed under
division (l)(5)A.2. of this section, the court shall issue an order that

purpose of providing scientific service to law enforcement agencies, and signed
by the person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the
basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,

from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer's regular duties, and giving an outline of

report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,

analyst appointed by the court.  Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused's analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances.  The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial.  If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused's analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused's attorney.  In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused's privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

of the alleged violation.  Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:

(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, 
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series.  Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section.  While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section 642.06:
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2913.61.
   (c)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Ohio
R.C. 2913.61(D), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to
this section.

that involves alleged tampering with a gas, electric, steam or water meter,
conduit or attachment of a utility that has been disconnected by the utility,
proof that a meter, conduit or attachment of a utility has been tampered with
is prima facie evidence that the person who is obligated to pay for the service

has caused the tampering with intent to commit a theft offense.
   (b)   In a prosecution for a theft offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2913.01,

state while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination
of them, or of a municipal ordinance relating to operating or being in physical
control of any vessel underway or to manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or
similar device on the waters of this state with a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement
officer has administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person found
to be in physical control of the vessel underway involved in the violation or
the person manipulating the water skis, aquaplane, or similar device involved
in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety tests
for vehicles that were in effect at the time the tests were administered,
including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that have
been set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, that by their
nature are not clearly inapplicable regarding the operation or physical control
of vessels underway or the manipulation of water skis, aquaplanes, or similar
devices, all of the following apply:
         A.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.

   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree and shall be punished as provided in division (j)(1), (j)(2), or (j)(3)
of this section.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (j)(2) or (j)(3) of this
section, the court shall sentence the offender to a jail term of three
consecutive days and may sentence the offender pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.24 to
a longer jail term. In addition, the court shall impose upon the offender a
fine of not less than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00)  nor more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00).  The court may suspend the execution of the
mandatory jail term of three consecutive days that it is required to impose by
this division (j)(1) if the court, in lieu of the suspended jail term, places
the offender under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25
and requires the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers'
intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3793.10. The court
also may suspend the execution of any part of the mandatory jail term of three
consecutive days that it is required to impose by this division (j)(1) if the
court places the offender under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three consecutive days; requires the offender to
attend, for that part of the three consecutive days, a drivers' intervention
program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3793.10; and sentences the
offender to a jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days
that the offender does not spend attending the drivers' intervention program.
The court may require the offender, as a condition of community control, to
attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or education programs, in
addition to the required attendance at a drivers' intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers' intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender's
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
      (2)   If, within six years of the offense, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this section, Ohio R.C.
1547.11 or one other equivalent offense, the court shall sentence the offender
to a jail term of 10 consecutive days and may sentence the offender pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.24 to a longer jail term. In addition, the court shall impose
upon the offender a fine of not less than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00)
nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). In addition to any other
sentence that it imposes upon the offender, the court may require the offender
to attend a drivers' intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio

it imposes upon the offender, the court may require the offender to attend a
drivers' intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3793.10.
      (4)   Upon a showing that serving a jail term would seriously affect the
ability of an offender sentenced pursuant to division (j)(1), (j)(2), or (j)(3)
of this section to continue the offender's employment, the court may authorize
that the offender be granted work release after the offender has served the
mandatory jail term of 3, 10, or 30 consecutive days that the court is required
by division (j)(1), (j)(2), or (j)(3) of this section to impose. No court shall
authorize work release during the mandatory jail term of 3, 10, or 30
consecutive days that the court is required by division (j)(1), (j)(2), or (j)
(3) of this section to impose. The duration of the work release shall not
exceed the time necessary each day for the offender to commute to and from the
place of employment and the place in which the jail term is served and the time
actually spent under employment.
      (5)   Notwithstanding any section of the Ohio Revised Code that
authorizes the suspension of the imposition or execution of a sentence or the
placement of an offender in any treatment program in lieu of being imprisoned
or serving a jail term, no court shall suspend the mandatory jail term of 10 or
30 consecutive days required to be imposed by division (j)(2) or (j)(3) of this
section or place an offender who is sentenced pursuant to division (j)(2) or
(j)(3) of this section in any treatment program in lieu being imprisoned or
serving a jail term until after the offender has served the mandatory jail term
of 10 or 30 consecutive days required to be imposed pursuant to division (j)(2)
or (j)(3) of this section. Notwithstanding any section of the Ohio Revised Code
that authorizes the suspension of the imposition or execution of a sentence or
the placement of an offender in any treatment program in lieu of being
imprisoned or serving a jail term, no court, except as specifically authorized
by division (j)(1) of this section, shall suspend the mandatory jail term of 3
consecutive days required to be imposed by division (j)(1)  of this section or
place an offender who is sentenced pursuant to division (j)(1) of this section
in any treatment program in lieu of being imprisoned or serving a jail term

   670.125   IMPLIED CONSENT.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Any person who operates or is in physical control of a
vessel or manipulates any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device upon any
waters in this municipality shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical
test or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for operating
or being in physical control of a vessel or manipulating  any water skis,
aquaplane, or similar device in violation of Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
         B.   The test or tests under division (a)(1) of this section shall be
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having reasonable
grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control of a vessel
or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device in violation of
Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.  The law
enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate which test
or tests shall be administered.
      (2)   Any person who is dead or unconscious or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (a)(1) of this section, and the test or tests
may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C. 313.12 to 313.16.
   (b)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for operating or
being in physical control of a vessel or manipulating any water skis,
aquaplane, or similar device in violation of Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance and if the person previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.
1547.11 or other equivalent offenses, the law enforcement officer shall request
the person to submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests
of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the
purpose of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer
who makes a request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a
chemical test or tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences
of refusing to submit to the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (c) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. The advice shall be in written form
prescribed by the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft and shall be
read to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was shown
to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting officer. The
reading of the form shall be witnessed by one or more persons, and the
witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. Divisions (a)(1)B.
and (a)(2) of this section apply to the administration of a chemical test or
tests pursuant to this division.
      (2)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (b)(1) of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
   (c)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, any person under
arrest for violating Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance shall be advised of the consequences of refusing to submit to a
chemical test or tests designated as provided in division (a) of this section.
The advice shall be in a written form prescribed by the Chief of the Division
of Parks and Watercraft and shall be read to the person. The form shall contain
a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest and read to the
person by the arresting officer. The reading of the form shall be witnessed by
one or more persons, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing
the form.  The person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to
the request of the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the
alleged violation, and if the person does not submit to the test or tests
within that two-hour time limit, the failure to submit automatically
constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (d)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, if a law
enforcement officer asks a person under arrest for violating Ohio R.C. 1547.11
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to submit to a chemical test
or tests as provided in division (a) of this section, if the arresting officer
advises the person of the consequences of the person’s refusal as provided in
division (c) of this section, and the person refuses to submit, no chemical
test shall be given.  Upon receipt of a sworn statement of the officer that the
arresting law enforcement officer had reasonable grounds to believe the
arrested person violated Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance and that the person refused to submit to the chemical test
upon the request of the officer, and upon receipt of the form as provided in
division (d) of this section certifying that the arrested person was advised of
the consequences of the refusal, the Chief of the Division of Parks and
Watercraft shall inform the person by written notice that the person is
prohibited from operating or being in physical control of a vessel, from
manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device, and from registering
any watercraft in accordance with Ohio R.C. 1547.54, for one year following the
date of the alleged violation. The suspension of these operation, physical
control, manipulation, and registration privileges shall continue for the
entire one-year period, subject to review as provided in this section.
      (2)   If the person under arrest is the owner of the vessel involved in
the alleged violation, the law enforcement officer who arrested the person
shall seize the watercraft registration certificate and tags from the vessel
involved in the violation and forward them to the Chief of the Division of
Parks and Watercraft. The Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft shall
retain the impounded registration certificate and tags and shall impound all
other registration certificates and tags issued to the person in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 1547.54 and 1547.57, for a period of one year following the date
of the alleged violation, subject to review as provided in this section.
      (3)   If the arrested person fails to surrender the registration
certificate because it is not on the person of the arrested person or in the
watercraft, the law enforcement officer who made the arrest shall order the
person to surrender it within 24 hours to the law enforcement officer or the
law enforcement agency that employs the law enforcement officer. If the person
fails to do so, the law enforcement officer shall notify the Chief of the
Division of Parks and Watercraft of that fact in the statement the officer
submits to the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft under this
division.
   (e)   Upon suspending a person’s operation, physical control, manipulation,
and registration privileges in accordance with division (d) of this section,
the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft shall notify the person in
writing, at the person’s last known address, and inform the person that the
person may petition for a hearing in accordance with division (f) of this
section. If a person whose operation, physical control, manipulation, and
registration privileges have been suspended petitions for a hearing or appeals
any adverse decision, the suspension shall begin at the termination of any
hearing or appeal unless the hearing or appeal results in a decision favorable
to the person.
   (f)   (1)   Any person who has been notified by the Chief of the Division of
Parks and Watercraft that the person is prohibited from operating or being in
physical control of a vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or
similar device and from registering any watercraft in accordance with Ohio R.C.
1547.54, or who has had the registration certificate and tags of the person’s
watercraft impounded pursuant to division (d) of this section, within 20 days
of the notification or impoundment, may file a petition in the municipal court
or the county court, or if the person is a minor in juvenile court, with
jurisdiction over the place at which the arrest occurred, agreeing to pay the
cost of the proceedings and alleging error in the action taken by the Chief of
the Division of Parks and Watercraft under division (d) of this section or
alleging one or more of the matters within the scope of the hearing as provided
in this section, or both. The petitioner shall notify the Chief of the Division
of Parks and Watercraft of the filing of the petition and send the Chief of the
Division of Parks and Watercraft a copy of the petition.
      (2)   The scope of the hearing is limited to the issues of whether the
law enforcement officer had reasonable grounds to believe the petitioner was
operating or in physical control of a vessel or manipulating any water skis,
aquaplane, or similar device in violation of Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, whether the petitioner was placed
under arrest, whether the petitioner refused to submit to the chemical test
upon request of the officer, and whether the petitioner was advised of the
consequences of the petitioner’s refusal.
   (g)   (1)   The Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft shall furnish
the court a copy of the affidavit as provided in division (c) of this section
and any other relevant information requested by the court.
      (2)   In hearing the matter and in determining whether the person has
shown error in the decision taken by the Chief of the Division of Parks and
Watercraft as provided in division (d) of this section, the court shall decide
the issue upon the relevant, competent, and material evidence submitted by the
Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft or the person whose operation,
physical control, manipulation, and registration privileges have been
suspended. In the proceedings, the Chief of the Division of Parks and
Watercraft shall be represented by the prosecuting attorney of the county in
which the petition is filed if the petition is filed in a county court or
juvenile court, except that if the arrest occurred within a city or village
within the jurisdiction of the county court in which the petition is filed, the
city director of law or village solicitor of that city or village shall
represent the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft. If the petition is
filed in the municipal court, the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft
shall be represented as provided in Ohio R.C. 1901.34.
      (3)   If the court finds from the evidence submitted that the person has
failed to show error in the action taken by the Chief of the Division of Parks
and Watercraft under division (d) of this section or in one or more of the
matters within the scope of the hearing as provided in division (f) of this
section, or both, the court shall assess the cost of the proceeding against the
person and shall uphold the suspension of the operation, physical control, use,
and registration privileges provided in division (d) of this section. If the
court finds that the person has shown error in the action taken by the Chief of
the Division of Parks and Watercraft under division (d) of this section or in
one or more of the matters within the scope of the hearing as provided in
division (f) of this section, or both, the cost of the proceedings shall be
paid out of the county treasury of the county in which the proceedings were
held, Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft shall reinstate the
operation, physical control, manipulation, and registration privileges of the
person without charge, and the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft
shall return the registration certificate and tags, if impounded, without
charge.
      (4)   The court shall give information in writing of any action taken
under this section to the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft.
   (h)   At the end of any period of suspension or impoundment imposed under
this section, and upon request of the person whose operation, physical control,
use, and registration privileges were suspended or whose registration
certificate and tags were impounded, the Chief of the Division of Parks and
Watercraft shall reinstate the person’s operation, physical control,
manipulation, and registration privileges by written notice and return the
certificate and tags.
   (i)   No person who has received written notice from the Chief of the
Division of Parks and Watercraft that the person is prohibited from operating
or being in control of a vessel, from manipulating any water skis, aquaplane,
or similar device, and from registering a watercraft, or who has had the

and if the officer does not charge the person with a violation of this section
or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise prohibited by
law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is not contraband, the officer
shall return the firearm to the person at the termination of the stop. If a

(ORC 2935.36(E))
   698.02   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
666.99 or
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) or (b)
(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant
to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section.  The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the

prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on

definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent

division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five- year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated
the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.

other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:

the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious

vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory

the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a

combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim's economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. The court may base the
amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the
offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating
the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other information, provided
that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the court holds an
evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from
the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:

immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund

division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender

confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.

division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
seventy dollars ($70.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), which
shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be credited to the address
confidentiality program fund created by Ohio R.C. 111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. 
A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(ORC 2929.28)
   698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section 698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections 666.99 or 698.02 of this
Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a sentence upon an
offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any sanction or
combination of sanctions under Section 698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not
impose a sentence that imposes an unnecessary burden on local government
resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section 698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section 698.02(c), (d), (e),
and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
   698.04   ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
   698.05   MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States.  Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131.  When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a
prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(ORC 2929.41)
   698.06   MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Section 698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating
and revision of these Codified Ordinances because substantially identical State
law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
   698.07   SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially similar.

   870.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Taxicab operator" means and Includes every corporation, company,
association, joint stock association, person, firm or copartnership, its
licensees, lessees, receivers or trustees appointed by any court whatsoever,
owning, controlling, operating, maintaining or managing one or more taxicabs
within the City.
   (b)   "Taxicab" means and includes any motor-driven vehicle engaged in the
business of carrying passengers for hire or fare or offered for hire or fare to
the public for transportation, operating within the City, except motor buses
operated on regular schedules and over regularly established routes.
   (c)   "Taxicab driver" means any person who drives or operates a taxicab.
   (d)   "Street" means and includes any public street, alley and public way
within the corporate limits of the City.
(Ord.72-93. Passed 2-13-73.)
   870.02   COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   No taxicab operator shall operate any taxicab for the transportation of
persons, for hire, on any street within the City, except in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord.72-93. Passed 2-13-73.)
   870.03   TAXICAB OPERATOR'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   No taxicab operator shall operate any taxicab business for the
transportation of persons within the City without first having obtained a
taxicab operator's license from the Mayor or other duly authorized issuing
authority, declaring that the public convenience and necessity require such
operation, as provided in this chapter.
   870.04   POWERS OF MAYOR RE TAXICAB OPERATORS.
   The Mayor is hereby authorized to:
   (a)   Require the filing of annual reports, schedules or rates of fare and
other data by all taxicab operators operating within the City, and that the
provisions of this chapter are carefully observed and fully carried out; and
   (b)   Prescribe rules and regulations and issue orders in conformity with
the provisions hereof applicable to any and all taxicab operators. No person
shall violate any such rule, regulation or order.
   870.05   TAXICAB OPERATORS' LICENSE APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   In addition to the requirements of Section 804.03, the taxicab
operator's license shall contain a description of the equipment to be used, the
number of taxicabs to be operated, a statement that the applicant, if granted a
license, will so operate its taxicab business as to be available for service to
the public at all hours, and such other facts as may be necessary.
   (b)   Such applications shall be signed and sworn to by the applicant and
filed as a permanent record in the office of the Chief of Police.
   870.06   HEARING BEFORE MAYOR.
   Whenever any applicant for a taxicab operator's license has complied with
all the conditions and regulations relating to the filing of his application,
the Mayor shall fix a date for the hearing of such application, which shall not
be less than thirty days from the date of filing, and forward a notice thereof
to Council at its next regular meeting. Notice of such hearing shall be given
to all persons interested, including the operators of all other taxicabs in the
City, at least five days before the date set for such hearing.
(Ord.72-93. Passed 2-13-73.)
   870.07   MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED.
   In determining whether the public convenience and necessity require the
operation of any taxicab business, the Mayor shall consider the number of
taxicabs operating in the City at the date of such application for the license
required in Section 870.03 and shall, in the issuance of such license, consider
whether the demands of the public require the additional taxicab service, the
financial responsibility of the applicant, the number, kind and type of
equipment to be used, and whether the additional taxicab service will result in
such congestion of traffic in the streets and at the taxicab stands in the City
as will constitute a demoralization of the taxicab business and be conducive to
a greater public hazard. The judgment of the Mayor on the operation of
convenience and necessity, as well as the qualifications of the applicant,
shall be final and conclusive.
(Ord.72-93. Passed 2-13-73.)
   870.08   TRANSFERABILITY OF TAXICAB OPERATOR'S LICENSE.
   No taxicab operator's license issued hereunder shall be permitted to be
transferred from one owner to another by the Mayor, except after a finding of
public convenience and necessity by him. Such finding shall be arrived at in
the same manner as in the case of an original application. The applicant for
the transfer of a license shall file with his application the consent in
writing of the former owner of such license and shall comply with all the
provisions and conditions of this chapter covering taxicabs.
(Ord.72-93. Passed 2-13-73.)
   870.09   INCREASE IN NUMBER OF CABS.
   No taxicab operator shall increase the number of taxicabs operated by it
without first having obtained the approval of the Mayor or other duly
authorized issuing authority, upon a showing of public necessity and
convenience therefor in similar manner and with like procedure as for the
issuance of an original taxicab operator's license, as provided in this
chapter.
   870.10   ANNUAL REVIEW.
   At the time of the issuance of the taxicab operator's license and annually
thereafter, on or before January 1 of each calendar year, no taxicab operator
operating in the City shall fail to pay to the Mayor or other duly authorized
issuing authority the fees as provided hereinafter for each original and
additional taxicab to be operated by it on the following basis:
   (a)   If put into operation between January 1 and June 30 of any year, for
the balance of the calendar year, the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) per year; and
   (b)   If put into operation between July 1 and December 1 of any year, for
the balance of the calendar year, the sum of seven dollars and fifty cents
($7.50).
   Nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that there shall be a
refund of any part or portion of any license fee so paid in case any taxicab is
taken off the streets and not thereafter operated by such operator during the
time for which a license has been issued.
   870.11   INFORMATION TO BE FILED.
   No taxicab operator's license shall be issued, nor shall any taxicab be
operated upon the streets of the City until the taxicab operator has filed with
the Mayor or other duly authorized issuing authority a statement showing:
   (a)   The make of motor car to be used;
   (b)   The State license number of each car;
   (c)   The factory number of the same;
   (d)   The name of the owner of the car;
   (e)   The seating capacity as provided for by the manufacturer; and
   (f)   The name of the drivers to be in charge of the operation of the cars
and their places of residence.
   870.12   INSURANCE REQUIRED.
   The statement referred to in Section 870.11 shall be accompanied by a policy
of liability insurance for each taxicab. Such policy shall be acceptable to and
approved by the Mayor, and shall be written by an insurance company authorized
to carry on business and write such policies in the State. Such policy shall
indemnify such taxicab operator in the sum of at least one hundred thousand
dollars ($100, 000) for injury to one person, three hundred thousand dollars
($300, 000) for injury to more than one person and ten thousand dollars ($10,
000) property damage in any one accident from the operation of the taxicab of
such operator. The policy shall further contain a clause obligating the insurer
to give ten days' written notice to the Mayor before cancellation of or
expiration of such policy. Such license shall expire upon the lapse or
termination of the policy. Such policy shall also contain a provision for the
continuing liability thereunder for the full amount, notwithstanding any
recovery thereon. If at any time in the judgment of the Mayor, such policy is
not sufficient for any cause, the Mayor may require the operator of such
taxicab to replace the policy of insurance with another approved by the Mayor.
(Ord.72-93. Passed 2-13-73.)
   870.13   IDENTIFICATION.
   (a)   Every person owning and operating a taxicab under license from the

lettering such taxicab that is approved by the Mayor. Such trade name, design,
color scheme or method of painting or lettering shall include the following
matter:
      (1)   A serial body number, assigned by the Mayor to such taxicab, and
painted on each side and on the rear of the taxicab; and

business, painted on each side and on the rear of the taxicab. Whenever the

"taxicab," "taxi" or "cab," then the word "taxicab" shall be painted on each
side of the taxicab immediately beneath such name or trade name.
   (b)   All mandatory lettering and wording, whether in a particular trade
name, design color scheme, method of painting or lettering, or otherwise, shall
be of such color as in the opinion of the Mayor will contrast distinctly with
the color of the body of the taxicab. The serial body numbers on sides and rear

(Ord.86-O-27. Passed 11-19-86; Ord.2004-0-01. Passed 1-27-04.)
   890.04   DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX.
   (a)   Method of Determination. In the taxation of income which is subject to
the tax levied in Section
890.03 , if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or
profession both within and without the boundaries of the City disclose with
reasonable accuracy what portion of his net profits is attributable to that
part of the business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the City,
then only such portion shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for the purposes of Municipal income taxation. The portion of the entire
net profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been derived from within
the City, in the absence of actual records thereof, shall be determined by
multiplying the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight, as follows:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
City during the taxable period, to the average net book value of all the real
and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated; as used in this
paragraph, "real property" includes property rented or leased by the taxpayer
and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual
rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the City, to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed; and
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City, to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result.
   (b)   sales Made in the City. As used in paragraph (a)(3) hereof, "sales
made in the City" mean:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City, regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the City;
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City, regardless of where title passes, even though transported from a
point outside the City if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion; and
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the City to purchasers outside of the City, regardless of where
title passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
   (c)   Total Allocation.Add together the percentages determined in accordance
with paragraphs (a)(1), (2) and (3) hereof or those of such percentages as are
applicable to the particular taxpayer, and divide the total so obtained by the
number of percentages used in deriving such total in order to obtain the
business allocation percentage referred to in subsection (a) hereof. A factor
is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or outside the City.
   (d)   Rentals.
      (1)   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under Section
890.03(a) (3) through (7) only if and to the extent that the rental ownership,
management or operation of the real estate from which such rentals are derived
(whether so rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through
agents or other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the
taxpayer in whole or in part.
      (2)   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of one hundred twenty-five
dollars ($125.00) per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of such properties is a business activity of
such taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to
tax, provided that in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed
or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds one hundred twenty-five dollars
($125.00) per month. In the case of farm property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in crops or when the
rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from the
farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds such one hundred twenty-five
dollars ($125.00) per month. The person who operates a licensed rooming house
shall be considered in business whether or not the gross income exceeds such
one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per month.
   (e)   Operating Loss Carry-Forward.
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
allocable to the City may be applied against the portion of the profit of
succeeding tax years allocable to the City until exhausted, but in no event for
more than five taxable years immediately following the year in which the loss
occurred. No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against net
profits of any prior year.
      (2)   The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the City in the same manner as provided in this chapter for allocating net
profits to the City.
      (3)   The Administrator shall provide by rules and regulations the manner
in which such net operating loss carry forward shall be determined.

         B.   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Municipality for

the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.

   891.05   COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Collection at Source; Withholding from Qualifying Wages.
      (1)   A.   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality’s income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
891.05(b) of this chapter or division (a)(4) or (a)(6) of this section. An
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the
tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer
directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or
credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
         B.   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division
(a)(1)A. of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may
also deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the
municipal corporation in which the employee is a resident.
      (2)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         A.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (a)(2)B. or (a)(2)C. of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end
of each calendar quarter.
         B.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399.00), or if the total amount
of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on
behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded two hundred dollars ($200.00). Payment under division (a)(2)B. of this
section shall be made so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator
not later than 15 days after the last day of each month.
         C.   Intentionally left blank.
         D.   Intentionally left blank.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee’s employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section 891.09(a) of this chapter,
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual’s disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation’s
successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer’s, agent’s, or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing the names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all employees from
whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee’s qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for Federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer’s employees and
constituting qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities
are under the employer’s control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or
gratuity is under the employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the
customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the
customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other
electronic means.
      (11)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

         G.   “Principal place of work” means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a

or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee’s “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            2.   For the purposes of this division (b)(1)G., the location at
which an employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with
division (b)(2)B. of this section, except that “location” shall be substituted

               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee’s qualifying wages
as provided in Section 891.05(a) of this chapter.
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee’s capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
         B.   For the purposes of division (b)(2)A. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a
municipal corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any
other municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the
amount of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent
performing one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have
been spent at the employee’s principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

            4.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (b)
(2)B.3. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee’s employer;
            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee’s final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee’s
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)
(2)A. of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee’s
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee’s principal place of work is located.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (b)(2)A. of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (b)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax
for that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
         C.   If an employer makes the election described in division (b)(4)B.
of this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee’s principal
place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
      (5)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee’s qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer’s fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section 891.03 of this chapter. To determine
whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable year, a Tax
Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax Administrator with
the employer’s Federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (b)(2)A. and (b)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section 891.05(a) of this chapter.
      (7)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on 12 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this State that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a “petroleum refinery” is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
            Notwithstanding division (b)(4) of this section, if, during a
calendar year, the number of days an individual performs personal services at a
petroleum refinery exceeds 12, the employer shall withhold tax for the
municipal corporation for the first 12 days for which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar
year on which the individual performed services at the refinery.

lottery terminal sales on behalf of the State to withhold and remit municipal
income tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as provided in
this division (c).
      (2)   If a person’s winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the Internal Revenue Service of the amount is required by section
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct
and withhold municipal income tax from the person’s winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
      (3)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in
trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
         A.   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator
shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, providing the name, address, and Social Security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
         B.   Annually, on or before January 31, a casino operator shall file
an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the municipal
corporation in which the casino facility is located, indicating the total
amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year. The casino
operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any amount that was
deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If the name,
address, or Social Security number of a person or the amount deducted and
withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for that
reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual return.
         C.   Annually, on or before January 31, a casino operator shall issue
an information return to each person with respect to whom an amount has been
deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year. The information
return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax deducted from the
person’s winnings during the preceding year. The casino operator shall provide
to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information return issued under this
division. The administrator may require that such copies be transmitted
electronically.
         D.   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the fate filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
         E.   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
            1.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
            2.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
            If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
         F.   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person’s winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
      (4)   If a person’s prize award from a video lottery terminal is an
amount for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by
section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales
agent shall deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person’s prize
award at the rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the
video lottery terminal facility is located.
      (5)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are
held in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is
owed.
         A.   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person’s name, address, and Social Security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
         B.   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
         C.   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (c)(5) of this section and shall make those
records available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with Ohio R.C. 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
         D.   Annually, on or before January 31, each video lottery terminal
sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax
Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is located
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with the annual
return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously
remitted. If the name, address, or Social Security number of a person or the
amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a
monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall be indicated
on the annual return.
         E.   Annually, on or before January 31, a video lottery sales agent
shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom an amount
has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year. The
information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax deducted
and withheld from the person’s prize award by the video lottery sales agent
during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent shall provide to the Tax
Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of each information return
issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may require that such copies
be transmitted electronically.
         F.   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (6)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
         A.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         B.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
         If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (7)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold
the required amount from a person’s prize award does not relieve that person
from liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
      (8)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
         A.   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to 50% of the tax deducted and
withheld;
         B.   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each return not
filed or filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and
withheld at the rate prescribed in Ohio R.C. 5703.47.
      (9)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section 891.07 of this chapter. This division applies only to the person for
whom the amount is deducted and withheld.
      (10)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts
and returns required under this section.

   891.06   INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
   (a)   Determining Municipal Taxable Income for Taxpayers Who Are Not
Individuals.  “Municipal taxable income” for a taxpayer who is not an
individual for the Municipality is calculated as follows:
   “Income” reduced by “exempt income” to the extent otherwise included in
income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any “pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward” equals “municipal taxable income”.
      (1)   “Income” for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the “net
profit” of the taxpayer.
         A.   “Net profit” for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
891.03(c)(23).
         B.   “Adjusted Federal taxable income” is defined in Section
891.03(c)(1) of this chapter.
      (2)   “Exempt income” is defined in Section
891.03(c)(11) of this chapter.
      (3)   “Apportionment” means the apportionment as determined by Section
891.06(b) of this chapter.
      (4)   “Pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward” is defined in Section
891.03(c)(32) of this chapter.
   (b)   Net Profit; Income Subject to Net Profit Tax; Alternative
Apportionment.  This division (b) applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business
or profession in the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who
resides in the Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined
company, or telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 5745.
      (1)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         A.   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual’s services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section 891.05(b) of this
chapter;
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   A.   If the apportionment factors described in division (b)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section 891.19(a) of this
chapter.
         C.   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(2)A. of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
891.19(a) of this chapter.
         D.   Nothing in division (b)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (b)(1)B. of this section, “wages, salaries, and
other compensation” includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         A.   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            1.   The employer;
            2.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described
in division (b)(3)A.2. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
         B.   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (b)(3)A. or B. of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (b)(1)C. of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
            2.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation
from a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
            3.   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
         B.   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
         C.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
         D.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
         E.   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal
corporation in which the property generating the net profit is located and the
municipal corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net
profit resides.
         A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(6)B. of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual’s net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual’s annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section 891.08(a) of this chapter.
      (7)   If, in computing a taxpayer’s adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee’s
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Sections 891.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4. of this chapter, by a
municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its
net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to
the taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation.
In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other than the amount upon
which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the
stock option not exempted from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
      (8)   When calculating the ratios described in division (b)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (b)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner’s ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (c)   Consolidated Federal Income Tax Return.
      (1)   As used in this division (c):
         A.   “Affiliated group of corporations” means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
State, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
         B.   “Consolidated Federal income tax return” means a consolidated
return filed for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
         C.   “Consolidated Federal taxable income” means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated Federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. “Consolidated
Federal taxable income” does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (c)
(1)A. of this section.
         D.   “Incumbent local exchange carrier” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 4927.01.
         E.   “Local exchange telephone service” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 5727.01.
      (2)   A.   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
            1.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under Federal law.
            2.   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (c)(2)B. of this section; or
            3.   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
         B.   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (c)(2)A. of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
         C.   An election made under division (c)(2)A. or B. of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm’s length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
      (4)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (c)(5)B., C., and D.
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
891.03(c)(1) of this chapter, by substituting “consolidated Federal taxable
income” for “Federal taxable income” wherever “Federal taxable income” appears
in that division and by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation’s” for
“a C corporation’s” wherever “a C corporation’s” appears in that division.
         B.   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section 891.03(c)(1) of this
chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to
the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated Federal taxable income.
         C.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
            1.   Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section 891.06(b) of this
chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
            2.   Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section 891.06(b) of this
chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity’s net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         D.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section 891.06(b) of this
chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make the computations required under Section 891.06(b) of this chapter by
substituting “consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to” for “net
profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in that section and by
substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for “taxpayer” wherever
“taxpayer” appears in that section.
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with
this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation
is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of
such an affiliated group.
      (8)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
   (d)   Tax Credit for Businesses That Foster New Jobs in Ohio.  The
Municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit
against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this division (d), it shall be
measured as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives
from new employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding 15
years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the
Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the
conditions of the credit.
   (e)   Tax Credits to Foster Job Retention.  The Municipality, by ordinance,
may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit against its tax on income to a
taxpayer for the purpose of fostering job retention in the Municipality. If a
credit is granted under this division (e), it shall be measured as a percentage
of the income tax revenue the Municipality derives from the retained employees
of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years. Before the
Municipality passes an ordinance allowing such a credit, the Municipality and
the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of the
credit.

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.

which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, “date of

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the

month of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for
the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 67.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the

      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid

through D. of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
891.09(a) of this chapter.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and
are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due
on the same date as the filing of the Federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G).
         B.   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and

      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer’s

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
891.10 of this chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that

payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under Section 891.09(a) of this chapter for that year.

was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that

   891.08   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   (a)   Tax Paid to Another Municipality.
      (1)   If a City resident has paid a municipal income tax on the same
income to another municipality, such resident may claim a credit of the amount
of income tax paid to such other municipality, but not in excess of the tax
assessed by this chapter.
      (2)   If a City resident is entitled to a credit for taxes paid another
municipality, such resident is required to file a return or form in such manner
as the Administrator may prescribe. If such resident fails, neglects or refuses
to file such return or form, he or she shall not be entitled to such credit and
shall be considered in violation of this chapter for failure to file a return
and make payment of taxes due under the provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Any claim for credit for income taxes paid another municipality on
the same income taxable under the provisions of this chapter shall be filed
with the Administrator on or before December 31 of the year following that for
which such credits claimed. Failure to file such claim within such time shall
render such credit null and void.
   (b)   Refundable Credit for Qualifying Loss.
      (1)   As used in this division (b):
         A.   “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   1.   Except as provided in division (b)(1)B.2. of this section,
“qualifying loss” means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer’s receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
            2.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid
to one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount
of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (b)(1)B.1. of this
section computed without regard to division (b)(1)B.2. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            3.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the
“qualifying tax rate” is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
         B.   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
         C.   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation’s proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         D.   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   A.   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         B.   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:
         A.   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         B.   The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (c)   Credit for Person Working in Joint Economic Development District or
Zone.  A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district
created under Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section 891.08(a) of this chapter.
   (d)   Credit for Tax Beyond Statute for Obtaining Refund.
      (1)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section 891.09(f) of this chapter.
      (2)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section 891.09(f), the Municipality will allow a non-refundable
credit equal to the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality against
the income tax the Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality’s tax rate
is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the tax rates is also
subject to collection by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest
accruing during the period of nonpayment.
      (3)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
891.09(f) of this chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section 891.08(a) of this
chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

      (1)   A.   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on

         B.   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under Section 891.05(a)(3) of this
chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer sole income subject to the tax

other payer, and no additional tax is due to the Municipality.
      (2)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent’s executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
      (3)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual’s duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
      (4)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary

      (5)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
      (6)   A.   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer’s Social Security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
         B.   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer’s Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, “Wage and Tax Statements,” including all information
reported on the taxpayer’s Federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service
form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
         C.   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the

         D.   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The Department of Taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The Department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
         E.   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer’s
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (a)(6)
of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic
form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         F.   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
      (7)   A.   1.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of State individual income tax returns under Ohio
R.C. 5747.08(G). The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on
forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax Administrator.
            2.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net

that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer’s taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
            3.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed
by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         B.   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and
make payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers
not otherwise required to file annual returns.
         C.   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section 891.09(b) of this
chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in Section 891.09(b) of this chapter, the provision in
Section 891.09(b) of this chapter prevails.
      (8)   A.   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         B.   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (a)(8)A. of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (a)(6)C. and (a)(6)D.
of this section.
      (9)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
Section 891.05(a)(2)B. of this chapter.
         A.   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
“The date of postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         B.   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, “submitted the payment” means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
      (10)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer as described in Section 891.05(a) of this
chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
      (11)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer’s refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
      (12)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing
a generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality’s ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
      (13)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
      (14)   A.   As used in this division, “worksite location” has the same
meaning as in Section 891.05(b) of this chapter.
         B.   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the
municipal corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the
person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal
corporation, and the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and
remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this
chapter. The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a
taxpayer who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation’s
income tax for the taxable year.
            The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation’s resolutions, ordinances, or rules.” The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
            3.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (a)
(14)B. of this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to
file any tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (a)(14) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from
performing an audit of the person.
   (b)   Return and Payment of Tax; Individuals Serving in Combat Zone.
      (1)   Each member of the National Guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member’s or civilian’s
duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the one hundred eightieth day after the member’s or civilian’s duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this division (b), the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant’s active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(b)(2)C. of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract
terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
         B.   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this division (b), the applicant shall neither
be required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required
to pay any tax otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-
first day after the applicant’s active duty or service terminates.
         C.   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (b)
(2)A. of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not
require any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes
for the extension period.
      (3)   A.   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in
this division the application of divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
         B.   1.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (b)
(3)B.1. of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding
extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used
in this section, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the National Guard or
a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces.
            2.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (b)(3)B.1. of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (b)(3)B.1. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
      (4)   For each taxable year to which division (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (b)(2)B. and C. or
(b)(3) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if
the filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for
that year.
   (c)   Use of Ohio Business Gateway; Types of Filings Authorized.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer’s net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return, or estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
      (4)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
      (5)   Nothing in this division (c) shall be construed as limiting or
removing the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and
enforce the provisions of its municipal income tax.
   (d)   Extension of Time to File.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s Federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic Federal extension for
a period other than six months for filing the taxpayer’s Federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended Federal income tax return.
      (3)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer’s Federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer’s municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer’s requested extension.
      (4)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
      (5)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing State income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer
shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income
tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be
the same as the extended due date of the State income tax return.
   (e)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   A.   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
         B.   Within 60 days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         C.   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
      (2)   A.   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (e)(2)B. of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section 891.19 of this chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
         B.   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
      (3)   A.   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by Section 891.19(e) of
this chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less,
no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth
in division (e)(3)B. of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s Federal or State income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section 891.09(f) of this chapter. Except as set forth
in division (e)(3)B. of this section, the request shall not reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s Federal or State income tax
return.
         B.   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (f)   Refunds.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of
the Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
         A.   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
         B.   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
      (2)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer’s claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
         B.   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (f)
(2)C. of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
         C.   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
891.18 of this chapter.
      (3)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for
filing specified in division (f)(2) of this section shall be considered to have
been filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
         A.   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
         B.   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
         C.   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
      (4)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section 891.10
(a)(4) of this chapter.
      (5)   As used in this division (f), “withholding tax” has the same
meaning as in Section 891.10 of this chapter.

      (1)   Exercise all powers whatsoever of an inquisitorial nature as
provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,

bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax

pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator’s own
motion, review, redetermine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,
determination, computation, assessment or order which the Tax Administrator has
made for which an appeal has been filed with the Local Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section 891.05(a) of this chapter.
   (b)   Authority of Tax Administrator; Compromise of Claim and Payment over
Time.
      (1)   As used in this division (b), “claim” means a claim for an amount
payable to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax
imposed in accordance with this chapter.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
         A.   Compromise a claim;
         B.   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator’s rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
      (4)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
      (5)   A.   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
         B.   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
      (6)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide
detailed financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether
or not a payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer’s failure
to provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator
shall preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
   (c)   Authority of Tax Administrator; Right to Examine.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator’s
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person’s
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal and State income tax returns under this division (c) shall
fail to comply.
   (d)   Authority of Tax Administrator; Requiring Identifying Information.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person’s Social Security number, Federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section 891.10 of this chapter, in
addition to any applicable penalty described in Section 891.99 of this chapter.
         B.   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (d)(1) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to Section 891.10 of this chapter.
         C.   The penalties provided for under divisions (d)(2)A. and B. of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section 891.99 of this
chapter for a violation of Section
891.15 of this chapter
            and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.

   891.16   OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   An “opinion of the Tax Administrator” means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an “opinion of the Tax Administrator” and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer’s request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator’s response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an “opinion of the Tax Administrator.”
   (c)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator’s opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer’s date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified State law, or the Municipality’s
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
State law, or the Municipality’s income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of Federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
Federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to Federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer’s material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
891.15 of this chapter.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) may not be appealed.

   891.17   ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person’s agent or the person’s affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee’s business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.

   891.18   LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
         A.   Members may be domiciled, but appointing authority may decide.
            The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled
in the Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality.
         B.   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member’s predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member’s
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review may be appointed to or
serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer’s right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator’s
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within 90 days after the board’s final hearing on
the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all
of the parties to the appeal within 15 days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board’s
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.

   891.19   ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to

            the extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period
of time the time limit described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section 891.18
of this chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision,
finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of
Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have
jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that
assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section 891.09(f) of this chapter.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section 891.18 of this chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any
court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed,
so that the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment
is less than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant’s assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section 891.09(f) of this chapter, with interest on
that amount as provided by division (d) of this section.

CHAPTER.
   (a)   A taxpayer may elect to be subject to Sections
891.57 to

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon the taxpayer's
election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The State Tax Commissioner as defined in R.C. § 718.01 shall serve
as the sole administrator of the municipal net profit tax levied pursuant to
this chapter for which the taxpayer as defined in Section
891.58(c) is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)   The Tax Commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to R.C. §

891.57 to
891.72, and any applicable provision of R.C. Chapter 5703.
   (b)   (1)   A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the Tax Commissioner and the City, on a form prescribed by the Tax

taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the Tax Commissioner and the City of its
termination of the election.
         B.   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form prescribed
by the Tax Commissioner, on or before the first day of the third month of any
taxable year.
         C.   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the taxpayer

   (c)   The Tax Commissioner shall enforce and administer Sections

      (2)   Adopt such rules as the Tax Commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the
duties imposed upon the Tax Commissioner by those sections.
   (d)   The Tax Commissioner shall not be considered a Tax Administrator, as
that term is defined in R.C. §
718.01 and Section
891.03.

H.B. 49 municipal income tax provisions is found unconstitutional, or the
effectiveness of any provision of H.B. 49 is stayed or enjoined, that the
provisions adopted in Section 891.57 shall likewise be stayed or ineffective."
(Ord. 2018-O-39.  Passed 11-13-18.)
   891.58   DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
891.57 to
891.72 that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in R.C. Title LVII and the use is not consistent, then the use of the term
in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall have
control over the use of the term in R.C. Title LVII, unless the term is defined
in R.C. Chapter 5703, in which case the definition in that chapter shall
control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes
other laws of the United States related to federal income taxes. If a term is
defined in both this section and Section 891.03, the definition in this section
shall control for all uses of that term in Sections
891.58 to
891.72.  As used in Sections
891.58 to
891.72 only:
   (a)   "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
891.59, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward
available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (b)   "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of R.C. § 718.01 and Section
891.06, means a C corporation's federal taxable income before net operating
losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal Revenue Code,
adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five percent of intangible income deducted
under division (b)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4)B. of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   Division (b)(4)A. of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under R.C. § 4313.02.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with Section
891.63(e)(3)B.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with Section
891.63(e)(3)B.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in Section
891.03(c)(47)B., and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the
election described in Section 891.03(c)(23)D., the taxpayer shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
Treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   Nothing in division (b) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (c)   "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
891.03(c)(47), except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or
entities subject to the tax imposed under R.C. Chapter 5745. "Taxpayer" may
include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are
required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (d)   "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
891.57 to
891.72 for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and includes
declarations of estimated tax.
   (e)   "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
891.57 to
891.72 is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation of more than
one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The Tax Commissioner may
prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year for a taxpayer that
has had a change of its taxable year for federal income tax purposes, for a
taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for federal income tax
purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new taxpayer that
would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (f)   "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax

(Ord. 2018-O-39.  Passed 11-13-18.)
   891.59   APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City and that has made the election under Section 891.57.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner may require, that
the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
891.67(a).
      (3)   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
891.67(a).
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         A.   The employer;
         B.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         C.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City as
follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the City only if, regardless of where title passes, the property
meets either of the following criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from a
stock of goods located within the City.
         B.   The property is delivered within the City from a location outside
the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees
in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the sales result
from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties, from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
   (e)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City in which
the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or
broker shall be allocated to the City based upon the ratio of the commissions
the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
located in the City to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under the Codified Ordinances by the City, the taxpayer shall add the
amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to the City. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its
net profit that was apportioned to the City any amount other than the amount
upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to
the stock option not exempted from taxation.
   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City under this
section.
   (g)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
Note: Pursuant to Section 5 of Ord. No. 2018-    , "if any provision of the
H.B. 49 municipal income tax provisions is found unconstitutional, or the
effectiveness of any provision of H.B. 49 is stayed or enjoined, that the
provisions adopted in Section 891.57 shall likewise be stayed or ineffective."

performance of its administration of the municipal net profits tax for
taxpayers making the election provided in Section
891.57. The Tax Administrator shall review these returns and information, as
well as the information received pursuant to divisions (b) and (c) of this

return. Such return, along with the amount of tax shown to be due on the return
less the amount paid for the taxable year under Section
891.65, shall be submitted to the Tax Commissioner, on a form and in the manner
prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, on or before the fifteenth day of the
fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year.
      (2)   If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one calendar

filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the Tax Commissioner
receives the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is
due, the Tax Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         C.   An extension of time to file under division (d)(1) of this

the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
Tax Commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact
the Tax Commissioner for information about the examination or other review of
the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond
to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the

return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax levied pursuant to this chapter in that taxable year and

return with respect to that taxable year. The election is binding for a five
year period beginning with the first taxable year of the initial election
unless a change in the reporting method is required under federal law. The
election continues to be binding for each subsequent five year period unless
the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under

Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause
shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under

the year following the last year of a five year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section

891.15(b)(1) or (b)(2) is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder
of the five year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section
891.57 is terminated, a valid election made under this section is binding upon
the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five year period.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the Tax Commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions

municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax

subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Tax Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer
has experienced a change in circumstances.

taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under Section 891.58(b) to the extent that the
item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been
eliminated or consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable
income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
891.59, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section

the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in Section
891.59, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
891.57 to
891.72 on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section 891.59 by substituting "consolidated
federal taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net
profit from" appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of
corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Sections
891.57 to
891.72 or R.C. Chapter 5703 to the corporation, an affiliated group of which
the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or
more members of such an affiliated group.

payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in the same manner as
the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the

each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         B.   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the Tax Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the Treasurer of
State. The Treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of R.C. § 718.85.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
R.C. § 5703.47 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,
unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e)
of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date, prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
891.57 to
891.72 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in
accordance with R.C. § 718.83.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal income
tax return for that year.
Note: Pursuant to Section 5 of Ord. No. 2018-     "if any provision of the H.B.
49 municipal income tax provisions is found unconstitutional, or the
effectiveness of any provision of H.B. 49 is stayed or enjoined, that the
provisions adopted in Section 891.57 shall likewise be stayed or ineffective."
(Ord. 2018-O-39.  Passed 11-13-18.)
   891.66   ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
891.57 to
891.72 or R.C. Chapter 5703, the following penalties shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
891.57 to
891.72 fails to make and file the return within the time prescribed, including
any extensions of time granted by the Tax Commissioner, the Tax Commissioner
may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per month or
fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the
due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on which the
return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division shall
not exceed one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
891.57 to
891.72 fails to do so, the Tax Commissioner may impose a penalty not to exceed
the following:
         A.   For each of the first two failures, five percent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         B.   For the third and any subsequent failure, ten percent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
891.57 fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid under this
chapter, the Tax Commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen percent of
the amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
891.57 to
891.72 that does not contain information upon which the substantial correctness
of the return may be judged or contains information that on its face indicates
that the return is substantially incorrect, and the filing of the return in
that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent
from the return to delay or impede the administration of Sections
891.57 to
891.72, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
891.57 to
891.72, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or 100 percent of the tax required to be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
891.68, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or 100 percent of the claim. Any penalty imposed under this
division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from the
date of the refund, may be assessed under Section
891.67 without regard to any time limitation for the assessment imposed by
division (a) of that section.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (c)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner
may adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (d)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
891.57 to
891.72 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in the
same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required to be distributed
to such municipal corporations under R.C. § 718.83.
Note: Pursuant to Section 5 of Ord. No. 2018-    , "if any provision of the
H.B. 49 municipal income tax provisions is found unconstitutional, or the
effectiveness of any provision of H.B. 49 is stayed or enjoined, that the
provisions adopted in Section 891.57 shall likewise be stayed or ineffective."
(Ord. 2018-O-39.  Passed 11-13-18.)
   891.67   ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under Sections
891.57 to
891.72 fails to file the return within the time prescribed, files an incorrect
return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for the period covered
by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an assessment against the taxpayer
for any deficiency for the period for which the return or tax is due, based
upon any information in the Tax Commissioner's possession.
   The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Tax Commissioner
consent in writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three
year time limit in Section 891.68 for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by Sections 891.57 to 891.72, or that files a
fraudulent return. The Tax Commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed
written notice of the assessment as provided in R.C. § 5703.37. With the
notice, the Tax Commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for
reassessment and request a hearing on the petition.
   (b)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the Treasurer of State. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Tax Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Tax Commissioner shall proceed under R.C.
§ 5703.60.
   (c)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax
Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin County.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from
the day the Tax Commissioner issues the assessment until the assessment is paid
or until it is certified to the Attorney General for collection under R.C. §
131.02, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is
certified to the Attorney General for collection, the entire unpaid portion of
the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (d)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (e)   If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Tax Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Tax Commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of
the court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (c) of this
section. Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer
assessed or the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in R.C.
§ 5703.37 within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk. The total
amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed
files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of this
section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the Tax Commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the Tax
Commissioner's consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (f)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the Treasurer of State does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the Board of Tax Appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
891.68, with interest on that amount as provided by that section.
Note: Pursuant to Section 5 of Ord. No. 2018-    , "if any provision of the
H.B. 49 municipal income tax provisions is found unconstitutional, or the
effectiveness of any provision of H.B. 49 is stayed or enjoined, that the
provisions adopted in Section 891.57 shall likewise be stayed or ineffective."
(Ord. 2018-O-39.  Passed 11-13-18.)
   891.68   REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
891.57 to
891.72, including assessments, shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner within
three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of
the tax, or within any additional period allowed by Section
891.67(a).  The application shall be filed in the form prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner.
   (b)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars ($10.00) and not less
than that claimed, the Tax Commissioner shall certify that amount to the
Director of Budget and Management and the Treasurer of State for payment from
the Tax Refund Fund created in R.C. § 5703.052. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars ($10.00) but less than that claimed, the Tax Commissioner shall
proceed in accordance with R.C. § 5703.70.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Tax Commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under R.C. § 718.83.
   (c)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (b) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the ninety-
first day after such determination until the day the refund is paid or
credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid at that
rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the
day the refund is paid or credited.
Note: Pursuant to Section 5 of Ord. No. 2018-    , "if any provision of the
H.B. 49 municipal income tax provisions is found unconstitutional, or the
effectiveness of any provision of H.B. 49 is stayed or enjoined, that the
provisions adopted in Section 891.57 shall likewise be stayed or ineffective."
(Ord. 2018-O-39.  Passed 11-13-18.)
   891.69   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
Section
891.57 and used to determine the tax due under Sections
891.57 to
891.72 must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the Internal Revenue
Service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax liability under those
sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax Commissioner
in such form as the Tax Commissioner requires. The amended return shall be
filed not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed upon or finally
determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal income tax
deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting therefrom, has been
assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer intends to file an
amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of
return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's
consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax
Commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (b)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
891.67 for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section,
together with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return no longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (c)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
891.68, if the application otherwise conforms to the requirements of that
section. An application filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time prescribed in
Section 891.68. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return.
Note: Pursuant to Section 5 of Ord. No. 2018-     "if any provision of the H.B.
49 municipal income tax provisions is found unconstitutional, or the
effectiveness of any provision of H.B. 49 is stayed or enjoined, that the
provisions adopted in Section 891.57 shall likewise be stayed or ineffective."
(Ord. 2018-O-39.  Passed 11-13-18.)
   891.70   EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (a)   The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
891.57 to
891.72 for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under those sections.
Upon written request by the Tax Commissioner or a duly authorized agent or
employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Commissioner, authorized agent,
or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
891.57 to
891.72 shall be open to the Tax Commissioner's inspection during business hours
and shall be preserved for a period of six years following the end of the
taxable year to which the records or documents relate, unless the Tax
Commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or
by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax Commissioner may require
any person, by notice served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax
Commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not that person is liable,
and the extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by a municipal
corporation.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person
to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records,
and federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The
person may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division
does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
Note: Pursuant to Section 5 of Ord. No. 2018-    , "if any provision of the
H.B. 49 municipal income tax provisions is found unconstitutional, or the
effectiveness of any provision of H.B. 49 is stayed or enjoined, that the
provisions adopted in Section 891.57 shall likewise be stayed or ineffective."

is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
Tax Commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Tax
Commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the City and taxpayer under Section
891.64 or
891.65, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing agreement.
Note: Pursuant to Section 5 of Ord. No. 2018-    , "if any provision of the
H.B. 49 municipal income tax provisions is found unconstitutional, or the
effectiveness of any provision of H.B. 49 is stayed or enjoined, that the

Note: Pursuant to Section 5 of Ord. No. 2018-    , "if any provision of the
H.B. 49 municipal income tax provisions is found unconstitutional, or the
effectiveness of any provision of H.B. 49 is stayed or enjoined, that the

(Ord. 2018-O-39.  Passed 11-13-18.)
891.99   VIOLATIONS; PENALTY.

   (a)   Special care shall be taken to reference all City, Federal, State,
County or private property monuments encountered in the line of the work so
that such monuments, if disturbed, shall be correctly replaced upon completion
of construction.
   (b)   No work shall be performed by the permit holder or his agents, nor
shall any excavation be backfilled, covered or filled, except in the presence
of an authorized City inspector. The cost of such inspection shall be borne by
the permit holder.

with that document known as "Standard Details," codified herein immediately
following this chapter and made a part hereof by reference.
   (d)   Privately owned facilities encountered in the work shall be protected,

backfilled with the material excavated, except that where such material is
shale or rock, sand or other suitable material shall be used. The backfill
material shall be rounded over the trench and sufficiently higher than the
adjoining ground surface, except as hereinafter noted, to allow for settlement.
   (f)   Where a trench passes through a regularly maintained lawn, the
backfill material shall be thoroughly compacted to minimize settlement and the
top portion brought to the grade of the existing lawn, after not less than
three inches of topsoil have been applied, raked, rolled and seeded so that the
finished area will be equal to the original lawn removed. In lieu of the
foregoing, the original sod may be carefully removed and stockpiled and after
the trench backfill is compacted, the sod may be replaced, seed added as
necessary, and rolled so that the lawn, as disturbed, shall be equal to the
original.
   (g)   Where the trench lies within driveway, parking or other areas subject
to traffic, the backfill material shall be sand, mechanically tamped, in not
more than eight inch layers, for the full depth of the trench. The material

application for consent to occupy or use the public right-of-way within sixty
days of the date on which the person filed the application with the City.
         A.   The City may withhold, deny or delay its consent to a person's
application to occupy or use the public right-of-way based on the person's
failure to possess the financial, technical and/or managerial resources
necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare, or for other
reasons based on the health, safety and welfare of the City and in accordance
with Ohio law.
         B.   If the City denies a person's application to occupy or use the
public right-of-way, the City shall provide in writing its reasons for denying
the application, and shall provide any information that the person may
reasonably request as necessary for the person to obtain the City's consent to
occupy or use the public right-of-way.
      (4)   The City's grant of consent for a person to occupy or use the
public right- of-way shall be in the form of a right-of-way occupancy
certificate which shall set forth the specific terms of the City's consent for
such person to occupy or use the public right-of-way.
      (5)   Each person submitting an application for consent to occupy or use
the public right-of-way shall reimburse the City for its administrative costs
related to the application, which reimbursement may be in the form of an
application fee or as provided in Section
1022.08, as may be determined by the City.
   (d)   Application to Existing Franchise Ordinances and Agreements.  For
purposes of this chapter, a franchise ordinance, franchise agreement or video
service authorization (VSA) shall be deemed consent authorizing the
franchisee's occupancy or use of the public right-of-way to the extent
described in the franchise agreement, ordinance or VSA. The franchisee's or
cable operator's use of the public right-of-way beyond that authorized by the
franchise agreement or VSA shall require additional consent for such additional
occupancy or use. Franchisees shall comply with the registration provisions and
construction standards to the extent that the provisions of this chapter do not
directly conflict with the franchise agreement or VSA. If there is a direct
conflict between the franchise agreement, ordinance, or VSA, and the provisions
of this chapter, the franchise agreement or ordinance or VSA, all control.
   (e)   Service Provider Insurance.  As a condition of the consent to occupy
or use the public right-of-way, a service provider must secure and maintain, at
a minimum, the following liability insurance policies insuring both the service
provider and the City, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents, employees, contractors, and representatives as additional insureds:
      (1)   Comprehensive general liability insurance with limits not less
than:
         A.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for bodily injury or death to
each person;
         B.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for property damage resulting
from any one accident; and
         C.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all other types of
liability.
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
limit of three million dollars ($3,000,000) for each person and three million
dollars ($3,000,000) for each accident.
      (3)   Worker's compensation within statutory limits and employer's
liability insurance with limits of not less than one million dollars
($1,000,000).
      (4)   Comprehensive form premises-operations, explosions and collapse
hazard, underground hazard and products completed hazard with limits of not
less than three million dollars ($3,000,000).
      (5)   The liability insurance policies required by this section shall be
maintained by the service provider throughout the period of time during which
the service provider is occupying or using the public right-of-way, or is
engaged in the removal of its facilities. Each such insurance policy shall
contain the following endorsement, or a substantially similar endorsement
approved by the City:
         "It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be
canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until ninety (90) days after
receipt by the City, by registered mail, of a written notice addressed to the
Administrative Director of such intent to cancel or not to renew."
      (6)   Within sixty days after receipt by the City of said notice, and in
no event later than thirty days prior to said cancellation, the service
provider shall obtain and furnish to the City replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
      (7)   Upon written application to, and written approval by, the
Administrative Director, a service provider may be self-insured to provide all
of the same coverages as listed in this section; except that all coverages for
Workers' Compensation shall be in compliance with State law. As part of the
review process, the City may require, and the self-insurance applicant shall
provide, sufficient financial information or documents necessary to make a
determination that the applicant has the ability to meet the needs and
requirements of this chapter.
   (f)   General Indemnification. Each application for consent to occupy or use
the public right-of-way, and each annual registration, shall include, to the
extent permitted by law, the service provider's express undertaking to defend,
indemnify and hold the City and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
employees, agents, representatives and subcontractors harmless from and against
any third party claims (including all damages, losses and expenses, reasonable
attorney's fees and costs of suit or defense) arising out of, resulting from or
alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful
acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the service provider or its
affiliates, officers, employees, agents, representatives, contractors or
subcontractors in the construction, reconstruction, installation, operation,
maintenance, repair or removal of its system or facilities, and in providing or
offering services over the facilities or system, whether such acts or omissions
are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter. A service provider,
however, will have no obligation to defend, indemnify or hold the City and its
elected and appointed officials, officers, employees, agents and
representatives harmless from damages or claims arising solely from the City's/
their own negligence.
   (g)   Performance Bond.  As a condition of consent to occupy or use the
public right- of-way and to ensure full and complete compliance with, and
performance under, this chapter, including any costs, expenses, damages or loss
the City pays or incurs because of any failure attributable to the service
provider to comply with the codes, ordinances, rules, regulations or permits of
the City, each service provider shall, in the amount of fifty thousand dollars
($50,000) or such lesser amount as the City Engineer may determine to be
necessary (i) provide an unconditional letter of credit, or other instrument
acceptable to the City, or (ii) furnish and file with the City a performance
bond running to the City in the required amount from a company licensed to do
business in the State of Ohio; which performance bond or letter of credit or
other instrument shall be maintained at the sole expense of the service
provider so long as any of the service provider's facilities are located within
the public right-of-way of the City. The requirements of this division (g)
shall not apply to a service provider that: (i) has presumed initial consent to
occupy or use the public right-of-way under division (b) of this section; and
(ii) has not been the subject of litigation or other enforcement action by the
City arising from the service provider's activities in the public right-of-way
within the five years prior to initial or annual registration hereunder.
      (1)   Before claims are made against the performance bond or letter of
credit or other instrument, the City shall give written notice to the service
provider:
         A.   Describing the act, default or failure to be remedied, or the
damages, cost or expenses which the City has incurred by reason of the service
provider's act or default;
         B.   Providing a reasonable opportunity for the service provider to
first remedy the existing or ongoing default or failure, if applicable;
         C.   Providing a reasonable opportunity for the service provider to
pay any monies due the City before the City makes a claim against the
performance bond or letter of credit or other instrument;
         D.   That the service provider will be given an opportunity to review
the act, default or failure described in the notice with the City Engineer.
      (2)   Service providers shall maintain the full value of the performance
bond or letter of credit or other instrument regardless of claims against the
performance bond or letter of credit or other instrument made by, or paid to,
the City.
(Ord. 2017-O-04.  Passed 4-11-17.)

following the date of registration, including all of the following:
         A.   A description clearly showing the location of all the proposed
capital improvements, including horizontal and vertical information; facility
type, size, depth, and capacity; or such other information the City Engineer
determines is necessary. In no event shall the description of the proposed
capital improvement be less than by City quadrant and/or street name and
facility type. The service provider shall update all required information as
soon as it becomes available.
         B.   If the service provider is constructing a new system or
reconstructing all or a portion of its existing system, general description of
the proposed system and the facilities utilized to provide the service that the
service provider intends to offer or provide over the system within the City.
Where a service will be provided by a nonaffiliated provider, the service

Commission to provide telecommunications or cable services over a system in the
City.
      (4)   Such other information as the City Engineer may reasonably require.
   (e)   Service Provider's Facilities Maps.
      (1)   The City shall have the right to access and review all the service
provider's maps and/or as-built plans showing the location of its facilities in
the City's rights-of-way, upon ten days notice to the service provider.
      (2)   Upon written request by the City Engineer, each service provider
shall work in good faith with the City to provide, in a reasonable time and
manner, maps and/or as built plans in a format compatible with the City's
current and/or future mapping system or a format mutually agreed upon by the
City and the service provider.
      (3)   The service provider may designate any portion or portions of the
maps and/or as-built plans provided under this division (e) as proprietary and/
or a trade secret so as to remain confidential. In this event, the City shall
seek to maintain the confidentiality of such maps and/or as-built plans;
provided, however, that such information is subject to applicable public
records laws and exceptions thereto. The City shall provide a service provider
with written notice of any proposed inspection or disclosure prompted by a
public records request related to the service provider's maps and/or as-built
plans the service provider has designated as proprietary and/or a trade secret.
The service provider shall have three business days from the written notice to
object to any public records disclosure and to agree in writing to defend and
indemnify the City with respect to any litigation under the Ohio Public Records
Act to compel disclosure and all costs thereof.
   (f)   Registration to be Kept Current. In addition to the annual
registration requirement, each service provider shall keep all required
registration information current at all times and shall provide the City with
notice of changes to the required information within fifteen days following the
date on which the service provider has notice of the need for such change.
   (g)   Registration Fee. Each service provider shall reimburse the City for
its administrative costs related to maintaining annual registration and such
reimbursement may be in the form of a registration fee or as provided in
Section
1022.08 , as may be determined by the City.
(Ord. 2017-O-04.  Passed 4-11-17.)
1022.04   GENERAL PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY USE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Rights Conveyed. Consent granted to or initially presumed of a service
provider to occupy or use the right-of-way under Section
1022.02 :
      (1)   Shall be limited to a grant to occupy or use the specific right-of-
way and defined portions thereof including the specific system or facilities
and location along the right-of-way;
      (2)   Shall not confer any exclusive right, privilege, license or
franchise to occupy or use the right-of-way of the City to operate a system for
delivery of services or any other purposes; and
      (3)   Shall not convey any right, title or interest in the right-of-way,
but shall be deemed consent only to occupy or use the right-of-way for the
limited purposes granted by the consent. Further, no consent shall be construed
as any warranty of title.
   (b)   Nondiscrimination. A public service provider providing service to the
public in the City shall make its services available to any customer within the
designated service area who shall request such service, without discrimination
as to the terms, conditions, rates or charges for the public service provider's
services; provided, however, that nothing in this division (b) shall prohibit a
public service provider from making any reasonable classifications among
differently-situated customers.
   (c)   Maintenance of Facilities, Landscaping and Other Aesthetic
Requirements. Each service provider shall maintain its system or facilities in
good and safe condition and in a manner that complies with all applicable
Federal, State and local requirements. A service provider with a construction
permit that includes a landscaping, screening and/or other aesthetic
requirement in connection with the placement of any structure or item above the
ground in the right-of-way, shall maintain the landscaping, screening and/or
other aesthetic requirement, on a continuing basis, in the manner specified in
the construction permit or other manner as approved in writing by the City
Engineer.
   (d)   Safety Procedures. A service provider or other person acting on its
behalf shall use suitable barricades, flags, flagmen, lights, flares and other
measures as necessary and in accordance with applicable State and local
requirements for the safety of all members of the general public and to prevent
injury or damage to any person, vehicle or property by reason of such work in
or affecting such public right-of-way or property.
   (e)   Interference with the Public Rights-of-Way. No service provider may
locate or maintain its facilities so as to unreasonably interfere with the use
of the public right-of-way by the City, by the general public or by other
persons authorized to use or be present in or upon the public right-of-way. All
such facilities shall be moved by the service provider, temporarily or
permanently, as determined by the City Engineer.
   (f)   Damage to Public and Private Property. No service provider nor any
person acting on the service provider's behalf shall take any action or permit
any action to be done which may impair or damage any City property, public
right-of-way, other ways or other public or private property located in, on or
adjacent thereto.
   (g)   Restoration of Public Right-of-Way, Other Ways and City Property.
      (1)   When a service provider, or any person acting on its behalf, does
any work in or affecting any public right-of-way, other ways or City property,
it shall, after the work is completed and at its own expense, promptly remove
any obstructions therefrom and restore such ways or property, within ten to
thirty days at the City Engineer's discretion, to as good a condition as
existed before the work was undertaken, unless otherwise directed by the City.
      (2)   If weather or other conditions do not permit the complete
restoration required by this section, the service provider shall temporarily
restore the affected ways or property as directed by the City Engineer. Such
temporary restoration shall be at the service provider's sole expense and the
service provider shall promptly undertake and complete the required permanent
restoration when the weather or other conditions no longer prevent such
permanent restoration.
   (h)   Duty to Provide Information.
      (1)   Within ten days of a written request from the City Engineer each
service provider shall furnish the City with documentation sufficient to show
that the service provider has complied with all requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   In addition, within ten days of a written request from the City
Engineer, each service provider shall make available for inspection by the City
at reasonable times all books, records, maps and other documents, maintained by
the service provider with respect to its facilities in the public right-of-way.
   (i)   Leased Capacity. A service provider shall have the right, without
prior City approval, to lease capacity or bandwidth to an unaffiliated service
provider, provided that when a lessee has physical access to the leased
facilities:
      (1)   The service provider shall notify the City of the lease agreement
within thirty days of such lease agreement; and
      (2)   The lessee has complied, to the extent applicable, with the
requirements of this chapter.
   (j)   Assignments or Transfers of Consent. Consent to occupy or use the
public right- of-way may be, directly or indirectly, transferred, assigned or
disposed of by sale, lease, merger, consolidation or other act of the service
provider, by operation of law or otherwise, without consent of the City, so
long as:
      (1)   The City is notified of the proposed transfer on or before the date
of transfer; and
      (2)   The transferee fully complies with this chapter within sixty days
of the transfer, including, but not limited to:
         A.   All information required by the application for consent to occupy
or use the public right-of-way pursuant to Section
1022.02, and/or registration required by Section
1022.03; and
         B.   Any other information reasonably required by the City.
   (k)   Transactions Affecting Control of Consent. Any transactions that
singularly or collectively result in a change of twenty-five percent or more of
the ownership or ultimate working control of a service provider, of the
ownership or working control of the service provider's facility, or of control
of the capacity or bandwidth of the service provider's system, Facilities or
substantial parts thereof, shall be considered an assignment or transfer
pursuant to this division (k).  Transactions between affiliated entities are
not exempt from this division (k).
   (l)   Revocation of Consent.  Consent granted by the City to occupy or use
the public right-of-way of the City may be revoked for any one of the following
reasons unless revocation is clearly prohibited by State or Federal law:
      (1)   Construction, reconstruction, installation, location, operation or
excavation at an unauthorized location.
      (2)   Construction, reconstruction, installation, location, operation or
excavation in violation of City safety and/or construction requirements.
      (3)   Material misrepresentation or lack of candor by or on behalf of a
service provider in any permit application or registration required by the
City.
      (4)   Failure to relocate or remove facilities, or failure to restore the

the City.
      (6)   Insolvency or bankruptcy of the service provider.
      (7)   Violation of material provisions of this chapter.
   (m)   Notice and Duty to Cure. In the event that the City Engineer believes
that grounds exist for revocation of consent to occupy or use the public right-
of-way, he shall give the service provider written notice of the apparent
violation or noncompliance, providing a short and concise statement of the
nature and general facts of the violation or noncompliance, and providing the
service provider a reasonable period of time not exceeding thirty days to
furnish evidence:
      (1)   That corrective action has been, or is being actively and
expeditiously pursued, to remedy the violation or noncompliance;
      (2)   That rebuts the alleged violation or noncompliance; and/or
      (3)   That it would be in the public interest to impose some penalty or
sanction less than revocation.
   (n)   Identification of Facilities.  When the City determines that
identification of facilities is necessary to begin planning for right-of-way
improvement projects, service providers, upon receipt of notice by the City,
are required to use reasonable efforts to field identify their facilities. In
identifying facilities, customary industry standards must be adhered to and
markings must identify the service provider responsible for the facilities. All
markings must also be clearly readable from the ground and include the service
provider's name, logo and identification numbering or tracking. Advertising is
not permitted and all marking colors shall be those approved by the City.
   (o)   Waiver of Requirements. It is within the City Engineer's reasonable
discretion to waive a portion or portions of this chapter where such
requirements, in the City Engineer's judgment, are not necessary or appropriate
to protect the City's interests and the purposes and intent of this chapter.
   (p)   New or Additional Facilities When the Right-of-Way is Full. The City
shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional
facilities within the public right- of-way if the right-of-way is full. In
making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety and welfare,
the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential
utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, future
City and county plans, if applicable, for public improvements, development
projects which have been determined to be in the public interest and
nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral treatment among service providers.
(Ord. 2017-O-04, passed 4-11-17.)
1022.05   LOCATION, RELOCATION AND REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   Location of Facilities.  All facilities shall be constructed,
reconstructed, installed and located in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:
      (1)   Facilities shall be installed within an existing compatible
underground duct or conduit whenever excess capacity exists within such
facility.
      (2)   Unless application of this provision is specifically prohibited by
State or Federal law, a service provider with permission to install overhead
facilities shall install its facilities on pole attachments to existing utility
poles only, and then only if surplus space is available; and no pole located
within the public right-of-way shall exceed fifty feet in height unless
approved by City Council ordinance.
      (3)   Whenever the existing electric, cable, telecommunications and other
similar facilities are located underground in a certain area in a public right-
of-way, a service provider with permission to occupy the same public right-of-
way with the electric, cable, telecommunications or other similar facilities,
must also locate its facilities underground to the extent technologically
feasible and economically practicable.
      (4)   Whenever a service provider is required to locate or relocate
facilities underground in a certain area of the right-of-way, every provider
with facilities within the same certain area of the right-of-way shall
concurrently relocate their facilities underground. This requirement may be
waived by the City for good cause shown including consideration of such factors
as: the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer
service needs, any law precluding such undergrounding of the facilities, and
hardship to the provider, as determined by the City Engineer. If a provider is
denied a requested waiver from the above requirements, the provider may appeal
the denial of the City Engineer to the Administrative Director as set forth in
Section
1022.99(c). Notwithstanding the above, no service provider shall be required to
bear the expense of relocation or undergrounding of any facilities if such
requirement would be prohibited by law.
      (5)   Except for overhead facilities as provided herein, no facilities
shall be located above ground in a public right-of-way without the express
written permission of the City Engineer.
      (6)   The City reserves the right to require a service provider to
provide excess capacity in the public right-of-way at the time of construction,
reconstruction, installation, location or relocation of facilities.
   (b)   Excess Capacity.  To reduce excavation in the public right-of-way, it
is the City's goal to encourage service providers to share occupancy of
underground conduit as well as to construct, whenever possible, excess conduit
capacity for occupancy of future facilities in the public right-of-way.
Therefore, if a service provider is constructing underground conduit in the
public right-of-way for its own facilities, and the City reasonably determines
such construction is in an area in which other service providers would likely
construct facilities in the future, the City may require the service provider
to construct the conduit in the public right-of-way with excess capacity in the
public right-of-way, provided the service provider shall be reimbursed for the
use of the excess capacity by another service provider, and subject to good
engineering practices approved by the City Engineer. The service provider may
charge a reasonable market lease rate for occupancy of the additional conduit
space as reimbursement.
   (c)   City Owned Conduit. If the City owns or leases conduit in the path of
a service provider's proposed facilities, and provided it is technologically
feasible and not economically impracticable for the service provider's
facilities to occupy the conduit owned or leased by the City, the service
provider shall be required to occupy the conduit owned or leased by the City in
order to reduce the necessity to excavate the public right-of-way. The service
provider shall pay to the City a public way fee that is assessed pursuant to
Section
1022.08 for such occupancy.
   (d)   Relocation or Removal of Facilities. Within thirty days following
written notice from the City, a service provider shall, at its own expense,
temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position of
any facilities in the public right-of-way, or commence such work if the City
determines completion within thirty days is unnecessary or overly burdensome,
whenever the City shall have determined that such removal, relocation, change
or alteration is reasonably necessary for:
      (1)   The construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance or
installation of any City or other public improvement, in, upon, or near the
public right-of-way;
      (2)   The operations of the City or other governmental entity in or upon
the public right-of-way;
      (3)   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the public rights- of-way; or
      (4)   The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part of
the public right-of-way. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a service provider who
has facilities in the public rights-of-way subject to a vacation or narrowing
that is not required for the purposes of the City, shall have a permanent
easement in such vacated portion or excess portion in conformity with R.C. §
723.041.
   Notwithstanding the above, no service provider shall be required to bear the
expense of removal, relocation, change or alteration of position of any
facilities if such requirement would be prohibited by law.
   (e)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within thirty days following
written notice from the City, any service provider or other person that owns,
controls or maintains any unauthorized system, facility or related
appurtenances in the public right-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove
those facilities or appurtenances from the public right-of-way of the City or
shall arrange to sell the system, facilities or appurtenances to the City,
unless removal or sale is prohibited by State or Federal law. A system or
facility is unauthorized and subject to removal, following notice, in the
following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon revocation of the service provider's consent to occupy or use
the public right-of-way;
      (2)   If the system or facility was constructed, reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained without the consent to do so, except
as otherwise provided by this chapter;
      (3)   Upon abandonment of a facility in the public right-of-way, with the
exception of underground facilities abandoned in a manner authorized and
approved by the City;
      (4)   If the system or facility was constructed, reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any excavation of a public
right-of-way was performed, without prior issuance of a required construction
permit, except as otherwise provided by this chapter;

(Ord. 87-0-8. Passed 4-28-87.)
   1044.06   EXTENSION OF WATER MAINS.
   Water main extensions may be made in any of the following ways:
   (a)   If the City is desirous of providing water service and fire protection
to certain areas and the Company agrees that it is financially feasible to do
so, the Company shall extend water mains upon the following conditions:
      (1)   Streets with existing water mains. The Company shall install new
water mains as outlined in its long range plan. Project priorities will be set
jointly by the Company and the City based upon the City's Master Fire
Protection Plan.
      (2)   Existing residential streets without water mains. The City and the
Company will determine, based upon the City's Master Fire Protection Plan,
which existing streets should receive water service and fire protection. The
Company shall install new water mains if a survey shows: A. That a water main
of sufficient size is available for extension to the area desiring service; and
         B.   That the owners of at least sixty percent of the frontage
abutting the proposed water main will:
            1.   Sign an application for service and agree to connect to the
extension and take service upon its completion;
            2.   Pay, in advance, a related facilities fee; and
            3.   Pay, in advance, a frontage charge per foot of frontage. The
frontage charge per foot shall be determined by dividing the estimated cost of
the main extension by the frontage along the route of such extension. If a
water main larger than eight inches in diameter is required by the Company in a
residential area, the frontage charge per foot will be based on the estimated
cost of a main of eight-inch diameter constructed under the same conditions.
   (b)   Extension of mains for private fire protection, industrial use, real
estate developments or other special service may be secured under the terms and
conditions outlined below
      (1)   General extension method. An applicant for a main extension shall
submit to the Company a set of detailed plans of the proposed construction,
showing the location, dimensions and type of proposed construction, the
location, dimensions and type of proposed mains and cost estimates (to be
reviewed by the Company) of the proposed construction. The plans shall be in
proper form for submittal to the City. Upon request, the Company will inform
the developer or other party as to how the construction plans are to be
prepared. Construction shall not commence until  the plans have been approved
by the Company and the City and a written main extension agreement has been
executed.
         A.   If the applicant desires that the Company construct the main
extension, the applicant shall arrange with the Company to pay the costs and
expenses which will be incurred by the Company in installing such main
extension and placing it in service.
         B.   If the applicant desires to construct the main extension himself
or herself, or to arrange with a third party to have the main extension
constructed, the Company shall place such main extension in service when the
following conditions have been met:
            1.   The water main has been pressure tested and disinfected
according to Company approved specifications.
            2.   The applicant has paid all costs incurred by the Company for
inspection of the water line construction.
            3.   The applicant has furnished the Company with a one-year
maintenance bond for all water main construction within the project,
such bond to take effect from the date the main is placed in service.
            4.   The applicant furnishes the Company with proof of payment for
all labor, pipe and other materials expended and used in construction of the
project.
      (2)   When the extension is placed in service, it shall become the
property of the Company, and the Company shall thereafter assume the
responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the same.
      (3)   If the Company and the developer or other party are satisfied that
the proposed extension will enable others situated along such extension to
obtain water service not otherwise available from the system, the Company, at
the request of the developer or other party, shall enter into an agreement
establishing a per foot frontage connection charge to be collected from every
applicant for water service having frontage along such extension and desiring
to connect to such extension, which charge shall be computed, collected and
disbursed as follows
         A.   The per foot frontage connection charge shall be computed by
dividing the developer's or other party's total cost of such extension by the
total number of feet of private property frontage, including property owned by
the developer or other party fronting such extension, but not including any
frontage for which water service has been or may become available from a
standard main of the system.
         B.   Each applicant for water service having frontage along such
extension, which frontage was taken into consideration in computing the per
foot frontage connection charge, shall pay to the Company, for the account of
the developer or other party, at the time of making application for service, a
connection charge computed by multiplying the per foot frontage charge by the
total front footage of the applicant's lot or parcel of land which is to
receive water service.
         C.   All such connection charges collected by the Company shall be
paid over to the developer or other party as collected. When the total of the
charges collected and paid over to the developer or other party equals the
total cost of construction, without interest, or after a period of fifteen
years from the date of the developer or other party agreement, whichever event
first occurs, no further connection charges shall be made by the Company and at
that time the Company shall be fully relieved of its obligation under the
agreement.
         D.   Upon the initial application for water service for any lot,
parcel of land, unit or facility abutting the main extension, the applicant
shall pay to the Company the appropriate related facilities fee.
   (c)   The Company, if it so desires, upon approval by the City, may
construct a water main which will enable parties situated along such main to
obtain water service not otherwise available from the system. The Company shall
establish a per foot frontage connection charge to be collected from each
applicant for water service having a frontage along such main connecting into
such main, which charge shall be computed and collected as follows
      (1)   The per foot frontage connection charge shall be computed by taking
the Company's total cost of such main, if such main is of eight-inch pipe or
smaller, or, if such main is of larger than eight-inch pipe, then by the
estimated cost of a main of eight-inch pipe constructed under the same
conditions, and dividing such cost by the total number of feet of private
property fronting such main, but not including any frontage for which water
service has been or may become available from an existing main of the system.
      (2)   Each applicant for water service having frontage along such main,
which frontage was taken into consideration in computing the per foot frontage
pipeline charge, shall pay to the Company, at the time of making application
for service, a connection charge computed by multiplying the per foot frontage
charge by the total foot frontage of the applicant's lot or parcel of land
which is to receive water service.
      (3)   Each applicant shall also pay a related facilities fee.
   (d)   No extension of a main shall be made until the grade of the street or
road is legally fixed by the City and until the surface thereof is within one
foot of such grade.
   (e)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Master Tariff P
. U . C .O . No.1, and except as set forth in subsection (b) hereof, there
shall be no refunds made relative to the extension of any distribution mains
constructed within the City after February 24, 1984. The Company shall continue
to make the charges and refunds authorized under prior tariffs for mains which
were constructed pursuant to such tariffs.
   (f)   As used in this section, "related facilities fee," "frontage charge,"
"estimated cost," "cost estimate," "estimated project cost," "cost,"
"construction cost," "connection charge," "charge," "total cost" and "pipeline
charge," including any terms of similar import or meaning, regardless of how
modified by adjectives, phrases or other terms, shall exclude any consideration
of the tax imposed on advances and contributions in aid of construction by
Section 118 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or by any similar provision
enacted hereafter and shall further exclude any consideration of the impact of
any such tax.
   (g)   Related facilities charges, when required to be paid pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter, shall be in the following amounts:
Size of Meter (in.)   Charge
   5/8      $ 420.00
   3/4      600.00
   1      1,071.00

   1044.07   RATES FOR SERVICE.
   The maximum rates that may be charged by the Company for water, water
service and fire protection furnished in the City shall be as agreed upon from
time to time by Council and the Company. Copies of the latest relevant
legislation may be obtained, at cost, from the Clerk of Council.
   1044.08   TAX INCREASES OR DECREASES.
   If the State levies, assesses or imposes any additional excise tax, or
increases any excise tax presently payable by the Company, during the period in
which this chapter is in force, then the rates fixed herein shall be increased
by the Company by filing a new schedule so as to provide sufficient additional
revenue to cover such new or additional tax or taxes. If there is a decrease in
any taxes levied, assessed or imposed against the Company by the State, during
the period in which this chapter is in force, then the rates fixed herein shall
be decreased by the Company by filing a new schedule so as to reflect the
decrease.
(Ord.87-0-8. Passed 4-28-87.)
   1044.09   TERMINATION.
   The City or Company shall have the right to terminate this chapter on
December 31, 1988, or thereafter at the end of any calendar year, by giving at
least six months advance written notice. The rights granted the Company by this
chapter shall automatically terminate upon the City or any other public body or

the abutting properties.
      (4)   "Marginal access street" means a minor street which is parallel to
and adjacent to an arterial street or highway, and which provides access to
abutting properties and protection from through traffic.
      (5)   "Alley" means a minor way which is used primarily for vehicular
service access to the back or the side of properties otherwise abutting on a
street.
   (b)   Subdivision. "Subdivision" means the division of a parcel of land into

   Subdivision proposals in flood hazard areas - see B. & H.
1444.15(d)
   1222.01   APPLICABILITY.
   Without exception, the procedure set forth in this chapter shall be followed
in detail in order to obtain approval of the final plat.
(Ord.1418. Passed 5-23-61.)
   1222.02   PREAPPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Previous to the filing of an application for conditional approval of
the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall submit to the Planning and Zoning
Commission at a regularly scheduled meeting plans and data as specified in
Chapter 1228. This step does not require formal application, fee or filing of a
plat with the Commission.
   (b)   At the next regularly scheduled meeting, the Commission shall inform
the subdivider that the plans and data as submitted or as modified do or do not
meet the objectives of these Subdivision Regulations. When the Commission finds
the plans and data do not meet the objectives of these Regulations, it shall
express its reasons therefor.
(Ord.1418. Passed 5-23-61.)
   1222.03   PROCEDURE FOR CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
   (a)   On reaching conclusions, informally as recommended in Section 1222.02,
regarding his general program and objectives, the subdivider shall cause to be
prepared a preliminary plat, together with improvement plans and other
supplementary material as specified in Chapter 1228.
   (b)   Five copies of the preliminary plat and supplementary material
specified shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission at a
regularly scheduled meeting with written application for conditional approval
at least ten days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered.
   (c)   Following review of the preliminary plat and other material submitted
for conformity thereof to these Subdivision Regulations, and negotiations with
the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of
improvements to be made by him, the Commission shall, at or before the second
subsequent regularly scheduled meeting, act thereon as submitted or modified,
and if approved, the Commission shall express its approval as conditional
approval and state the conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved,
shall express its disapproval and its reasons therefor.
   (d)   The action of the Commission shall be noted on two copies of the
preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any conditions determined. One
copy shall be returned to the subdivider and the other retained by the
Commission.
   (e)   Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute
approval of the final plat (subdivision plat). Rather, it shall be deemed an
expression of approval to the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a
guide to the preparation of the final plat which will be submitted for the
approval of the Commission and for recording upon fulfillment of the
requirements of these Regulations and any conditions of the conditional
approval.
(Ord.1418. Passed 5-23-61.)
   1222.04   PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT.
   (a)   The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as
approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that
portion of the approved preliminary plat which he proposes to record and
develop at the time, provided that such portion conforms to all requirements of
these Subdivision Regulations.
   (b)   The final plat and written application for approval thereof shall be
submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission at the last regularly scheduled
meeting prior to the meeting at which it is to be acted upon.
   (c)   Six copies of the final plat and other exhibits required for approval
shall be prepared as specified in Chapter 1228 and shall be submitted to the
Commission at a regularly scheduled meeting within twelve months after
conditional approval of the preliminary plat. Such conditional approval shall
become null and void unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by
the Commission.

   All of the conditions set forth in this chapter, as well as pertinent zoning
regulations, shall govern the preparation of all plans and data required by
these Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord.1418. Passed 5-23-61.)
   1224.02   STREETS.
   (a)   The arrangement, character, extent, width and location of all streets
shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to
topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their
appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such
streets.
   (b)   The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
      (1)   Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing
principal streets in surrounding areas; or
      (2)   Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the
Planning and Zoning Commission to meet a particular situation where
topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing
streets impractical.
   (c)   Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic
will be discouraged.
   (d)   Where the subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse
frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the
rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment
as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to
afford separation of through and local traffic.
   (e)   Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be permitted only
where their control is definitely placed in the City under conditions approved
by the Commission.
   (f)   Intersection jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall
be avoided.
   (g)   Wherever possible, a tangent at least fifty feet long shall be
introduced between reverse curves on all streets.
   (h)   All horizontal deflections in the alignment of streets shall be
connected by a circular curve as follows:
Total Deflection Angle (Degrees)     Minimum Centerline Radius (Ft.)

On arterial or collector streets, or under certain other special conditions, a
greater radius may be required by the Commission.
   (i)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at an angle of less
than seventy-five degrees.
   (j)   Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius
of twenty feet, or of a greater radius where the Commission deems it necessary.
The Commission may permit comparable cut-offs or chords in place of rounded
corners.

      Street Type           Right-of-Way Width (Ft.)
      Arterial         Varies

      Minor            60
      Marginal Access      40
      (1)   Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these Subdivision Regulations and where the Commission finds it
will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the
adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract
to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted and dedicated
within such tract.
   (m)   Unless otherwise specifically authorized, permanent dead-end streets
shall not be longer than 500 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with
a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least eighty feet and a
street property line diameter of at least 100 feet, with turnout radii of fifty
feet.
   (n)   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with
the names of existing streets in the County. Street names shall be subject to
the approval of the Commission.
(Ord.1418. Passed 5-23-61.)
   1224.03   ALLEYS.
   (a)   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts,

other definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-
street loading, unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses
proposed.
   (b)   The width of an alley shall be twenty-six feet.
   (c)   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided,
but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit reasonable
and safe vehicular movement.
   (d)   Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the dead-end, as
determined by the Commission.
(Ord.1418. Passed 5-23-61.)
   1224.04   EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be
provided for utilities where necessary and shall be ten feet wide or more,
depending on the proposed usage.
   (b)   Where the subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way,
channel, storm conduit or stream, there shall be provided a storm water
easement or drainage right of way conforming substantially with the lines of
such watercourse, and of such width as will be adequate for the purpose of
construction and maintenance. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in
connection therewith.
(Ord.1418. Passed 5-23-61.)
   1224.05   BLOCKS.
   (a)   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to:

and for the type of development and use contemplated.
   (b)   Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning Code.
   (c)   Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit
appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets.
   (d)   The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide, by means of a
public street, each lot with satisfactory access to an existing public street.
   (e)   Double frontage, and reverse frontage lots, should be avoided except
where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A
planting screen easement of at least ten feet, and across which there shall be
no right of access, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such a
traffic artery or other disadvantageous use.
   (f)   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to
street lines.

seven inch thickness of concrete, reinforced throughout with a welded wire
fabric of uniform size and spacing weighing not less than fifty-eight pounds
per 100 square feet, all in accordance with such "Regulations, Standards and
Specifications" as may be so established from time to time. Under certain
special conditions, particularly where evidence indicates at the time of
construction that the base upon which the pavement is to be constructed is of a
suitable nature, the City may permit the construction of the "alternate
section" without reinforcing steel, and commonly known as "8-6-8" pavement, all
in accordance with such "Regulations, Standards and Specifications" as may be
established from time to time. The materials and proportion of material for
concrete for paving shall conform to latest specifications and revisions
thereto of the Ohio Department of Transportation for Class "D" concrete with
five percent air entrainment which requires six and one-half sacks of cement
minimum and five and one-half gallons of water minimum, including aggregate

graded as to allow no ponding whatsoever of any surface water.
   (b)   Wherever feasible, grading shall be accomplished in such fashion that
all surface water shall drain into inlets constructed within limits of the
right of way.
   (c)   Where necessary, inlets and conduits draining into storm conduits
shall be constructed in areas outside the limits of the right of way.
   (d)   The methods outlined in subsections (b) and (c) hereof are not to be
construed as to prohibit any drainage, wherever feasible, into natural or
constructed drainage channels.
   (e)   Particular attention shall be given to all grading so as to avoid any
ponding on or excessive runoff to contiguous property of any surface water,
both during and subsequent to the period of construction.
   (f)   In unpaved areas the minimum allowable gradient of the surface to
accomplish overland flow shall be seven-tenths of one percent. The maximum
allowable length of flow of surface water before entering an inlet to a conduit
or a natural or constructed drainage channel shall be 500 feet.

   1240.01   PURPOSE.
   (a)   This Zoning Code is adopted to promote and protect the public health,
safety, convenience, comfort, property or general welfare by regulating and
restricting the bulk, height, design, percent of lot coverage and location of
buildings, regulating and limiting the density of population, regulating the
use of buildings and land for agriculture, residence, business, industry or
other uses, and for such purposes to divide the City into districts of such
number, shape and area as may be considered best to carry out these regulations
and provide for their enforcement.
   (b)   In addition, more specific purposes are as follows:
      (1)   To protect the character and the values of the agricultural,
residential, business, industrial and recreational areas and to assure their
orderly and beneficial development;
      (2)   To provide adequate open spaces for light and air, to prevent
overcrowding the land, excessive concentration of the population, and, on the
other hand, excessive and wasteful scattering of the population;
      (3)   To lessen congestion on the streets, to improve the public safety
by locating buildings and uses adjacent to streets so that they will cause the
least interference with, and be damaged the least by, traffic movements;
      (4)   To facilitate adequate provisions for public utilities and
facilities such as recreation, schools, sewerage, water, transportation and
other public requirements; and
      (5)   To encourage the most appropriate uses of the land and guide the
future development of the City.

   1242.01   DUTIES OF ZONING INSPECTOR GENERALLY.
   This Zoning Code shall be enforced by the Zoning Inspector for the City. 
Before any zoning permit or certificate of occupancy is issued, the application
therefor and any plans accompanying such application shall be examined to
ascertain whether the proposed work and use will conform to the provisions of
this Zoning Code.
(Ord.79-O-14.  Passed 7-24-79.)
   1242.02   ZONING PERMITS.
   (a)   Permit Required. 
      (1)   No person shall start an excavation or erect, alter, enlarge, move
or demolish a building or structure without first having obtained a zoning
permit therefor from the Zoning Inspector. In the absence of the Zoning
Inspector for a continuous period of more than twenty-four hours, the Mayor or
the Administrative Director may issue zoning permits and perform the other
duties of the Zoning Inspector.
      (2)   A zoning permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall become void
if the proposed move, construction, alteration, demolition or change of use for
which the permit has been issued is not commenced and completed within one year
after the permit is issued. In the event that the above referenced activity is
not commenced and completed within one year after the permit is issued, any
further or continued construction, alteration, moving or demolition or change
of use of the property shall require a new zoning permit in conformity with the
then current zoning laws. For the purposes of this section, the work shall be
considered completed if the entire exterior of the building has been completed
moved, or demolished pursuant to the original plans and pursuant to the
building codes that are in effect for the City.
      (3)   This section shall also apply to all outstanding zoning permits
that have been issued as of the date of the passage of this section. All
previously issued zoning permits shall become void within one year after the
date that this section was passed, and all such zoning permits are subject to
all the terms and conditions of this section. In the event that the
construction is not commenced and completed within one year after the passage
of this section, any further or continued construction, demolition, moving,
alteration or change of use of the property shall require a new zoning permit
in conformity with the then current zoning laws.
(Ord. 94-O-16.  Passed 2-14-95; Ord. 2016-O-30.  Passed 12-13-16.)
   (b)   Site Plans.  Every application for such permit under the provisions of
this Zoning Code shall be accompanied by a site plan, drawn to scale, showing

(Ord.79-O-14. Passed 7-24-79.)
   1242.025   DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to provide adequate review by
the Planning and Zoning Commission of proposed development in those zoning
districts where the uses permitted are of such a nature that they, because of
their size, scale and operation, could have an adverse effect on the health,
safety and general welfare of the surrounding community without the safeguards
of this review. Development plan reviews shall be required for:
      (1)   New construction of all multifamily, condominium, business,
industrial, institutional and recreational uses;
      (2)   All conditional uses; and
      (3)   Existing or previously approved developments which propose to
increase the number of dwellings or units in a multifamily development, to
expand the floor area of commercial, industrial, institutional or recreational
uses or to change a use which requires a modification in the amount of parking
or the site's circulation.
   (b)   Preliminary Plans. An applicant is encouraged to meet informally with
the Zoning Inspector prior to submitting plans to the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Additionally, an applicant may request a preliminary plan review by
the Planning and Zoning Commission. Preliminary plans should be submitted to
the Zoning Inspector ten days prior to the Planning and Zoning Commission
meeting to be scheduled on the agenda. Planning and Zoning Commission approval
of a preliminary development plan indicates that based on the preliminary
information submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission, the project could
satisfy the substantive requirements for the proposed use in the district in
which it is to be located and comply with the purpose and basic planning
objectives of this Zoning Code. However, such preliminary plan approval does
not assure approval of the final development plan. Based on an approved
preliminary plan, the applicant may then proceed to prepare final plans in
compliance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (c)   Final Development Plan. No zoning permit shall be issued for the
addition, construction or use of any building which requires a development plan
review pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, except in accordance with a
development plan approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission. An application
for review of a development plan shall be submitted to the Zoning Inspector. It
may be filed by a land owner or a developer on behalf of an owner or a group of
owners acting jointly. The Zoning Inspector shall review the application to
assure compliance with the submission requirements. If the requirements have
not been satisfied, the application shall be returned to the applicant with the
deficiencies noted. A final development plan shall include:
      (1)   A property location map and topographical survey of the proposed
development area showing the following information: property lines; easements;
street rights-of-way; topography lines at two-foot intervals; existing
buildings and structures; and landscape features, including existing trees and
wooded areas and existing drainage patterns for the subject site and
surrounding property.
      (2)   A proposed development plan, appropriately dimensioned and labeled,
including:  the location and use of buildings; the location of structures on
surrounding properties; landscaping and screening; utilities; surface drainage;
vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including driveways, access, sidewalks
and parking and loading areas; a description of surface materials, including
the type of pavement, sidewalks and landscaped areas; and other site
improvements, such as lighting, fences and signs.
      (3)   Preliminary floor plans and architectural sketches of buildings and
other structures.
      (4)   A summary table showing total acres and the amount of land area
devoted to each proposed residential and nonresidential use and streets.
      (5)   Such other reasonable supplemental information as may be required
by the Zoning Inspector or the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (6)   A fee, as established by City Council.
   (d)   Review Procedures.
      (1)   Any administrative review undertaken by City officials or
consultants at the request of the Zoning Inspector should be completed and the
reports and/or comments made available to the Planning and Zoning Commission at
the time of the Commission's review.
      (2)   In reviewing a final development plan, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall consider setbacks; the orientation of buildings, parking areas
and other features with respect to the topography of the lot and existing
natural features, such as streams and large trees; the efficiency, adequacy and
safety of the proposed layout of internal streets and driveways; and the
location of the green area provided; bearing in mind the possible effects of
irregularly shaped lots and such other matters as the Commission may find to
have a material bearing upon the stated standards and objectives of the various
district regulations. In approving a development plan, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall find that:
         A.   The appropriate use and value of property within and adjacent to
the area will be safeguarded.
         B.   The development will result in a harmonious grouping of buildings
within the proposed development and in relationship to existing and proposed
uses on adjacent property.
         C.   The development will have adequate public service, parking, open
spaces and traffic access to the property.
         D.   The plan, to the extent practical, will preserve and be sensitive
to the natural characteristics of the site.
         E.   Adequate provision is made for safe and efficient pedestrian and
vehicular circulation within the site, on adjacent property and on the public
right of ways that serve the subject property.
         F.   Adequate provision is made for storm drainage within and through
the site so as to maintain, as far as practicable, usual and normal swales,
watercourses and drainage areas.
            If the project is to be carried out in progressive stages, each
stage  shall be so planned that the foregoing conditions are complied with at
the completion of each stage.
      (3)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may either approve, approve with
modifications or reject the proposal. If the Commission finds that a proposed
plan of development does not meet the purposes of these regulations, it shall
disapprove the plan and shall submit its findings, in writing, together with
the reasons therefor, to the applicant. Based on the factors set forth above,
the Planning and Zoning Commission may require a traffic impact study of the
subject property and the Planning and Zoning Commission may require the
developer of the property to comply with the traffic impact study.
      (4)   Failure by the Commission to act within forty-five days from the
time the plan has been deemed complete and accepted pursuant to division (c) of
this section, or an extended time period agreed upon with the applicant, shall,
at the applicant's option, be deemed a denial of the development plan
application.
      (5)   A development plan shall remain valid for a period of twelve months
following the date of its approval. If, at the end of that time, construction
has not been diligently begun, then such development plan shall be considered
as having lapsed and shall be of no effect unless it is resubmitted to the
Commission and reapproved. All construction and development under any zoning or
building permit shall be in accordance with the approved development plan. Any
changes in an approved plan shall be resubmitted for approval in accordance
with this subsection.

is primarily directed at minors between the ages of thirteen and seventeen
years of age, whether the entertainment is live entertainment or not and

business if the business also has a license from the State of Ohio to sell
liquor or other alcoholic beverages at the location of such a business.  A
business may host parties or events at the business location, provided that the
parties or events are private and not open to the general public.

application shall be published once a week for two successive weeks, prior to
the public hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.
   (e)   Planning and Zoning Commission Action; Issuance of Conditional Use
Permits.  The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have the power to issue
conditional use permits. In deciding whether or not to grant an application for
a conditional use permit, the Commission shall determine how the community will
be affected if the proposed use is carried out under the specific and limiting
standards established for the conditional use. The Commission shall make a
determination, based on the evidence presented at the hearing referred to in
division (d) of this section, as to how the appropriate use of neighboring
property may or may not be injured by the proposed use. Appropriate conditions
and safeguards shall be specified in the permit in order to promote the general
welfare, preserve the existing character of the district, protect adjacent

(Ord.85-O-18. Passed 9-10-85.)
   1242.04   STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING PERMITTED USES NOT SPECIFICALLY

provision of this Zoning Code do not specifically include a use for which there
is an application, the application shall be referred to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for a determination as to the appropriate classification. Such
determination shall be based upon data as to similarity to other uses, the
amount of objectionable noise, vibration, smoke, dust or odors that may be
created by the particular operation, the amount of traffic generated, and other
conditions that may be created by the particular use or process that may
adversely affect the adjacent neighborhoods. Solutions to such problems and

(Ord.79-0-14. Passed 7-24-79.)
   1244.05   VARIANCE POWERS OF THE BOARD.
   (a)   Authorization.Where there is practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the provisions of this
Zoning Code, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power, in a specific
case, to vary or modify the application of any such provisions in harmony with
the general purpose and intent of this Zoning Code so that public health,
safety, morals and general welfare may be safeguarded and substantial justice
done.
   (b)   General Limitations. The granting of variances shall be limited to the
following cases:
      (1)   The practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship inheres in and is
peculiar to the premises sought to be built upon or used because of physical
size, shape or other characteristics of the premises or adjoining premises, as
the same existed on September 14, 1955, which differentiate it from other
premises in the same district;
      (2)   Refusal of the variance appealed for will deprive the owner of the
reasonable use of his property;
      (3)   Granting of a variance will not be materially detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements, or alter the
essential character of the locality; and
      (4)   Granting of a variance will not be contrary to the objectives of
this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Specific Limitations.
      (1)   Variations from use regulations. The Board may permit a slight
variation where it is necessary to secure an appropriate development of a lot
adjoining buildings or uses existing on September 14, 1955, not conforming to
the applicable district regulations, or adjoining a less restricted use
district along a side lot line, provided that:
         A.   Such lot was under the same ownership on such effective date; and
         B.   The proposed use is not more than the next lower in order of
restrictiveness, except that less restrictive uses shall not be permitted in
any Residential District.
      (2)   Variations from area regulations. The Board may permit in any
district slight variations, not exceeding twenty percent, in the application of
the area regulations as may be necessary to secure appropriate improvements of
a lot that is of such restricted area that it cannot be appropriately improved
without such variation, provided that it is adjacent to buildings which do not
conform to such area regulations and that such lot was separately owned on such
effective date and cannot be enlarged.
      (3)   Variations from yard regulations. The Board may permit in any
district slight variations, not exceeding twenty percent, to the yard
dimensions as may be necessary to permit the use of an existing building for a
purpose for which the regulations require a greater yard area than existing on
the premises, provided that the Board determines that adequate light and
ventilation will be had and that unsafe, unhealthy and unsanitary conditions
will not be created. Such twenty percent limitation shall not apply to parcels
of land exempt therefrom by virtue of Section 1252.08(f).
   The twenty percent limitation shall not apply to land in the Business
District in the following instance: The property is so situated that it has a
frontage on Munson Road and also on Plains Road. In this situation, the sixty-
foot front setback line requirements shall apply to the Munson Road property
frontage and only a twenty percent variance can be granted to the sixty-foot
setback requirement. The Board may allow the setback requirement on the Plains
Road frontage to be twenty-four feet rather than the sixty-foot front setback
requirement. The Board may grant this variance for the Plains Road front
setback based on the standards for granting a variance that are set forth in
the preceding paragraph.
      (4)   Variationstoheight regulations.The Board may permit the
construction of an addition to an existing building to the same height as an
adjacent building, if such height is essential to the completion of the
building as originally planned.
      (5)   Variations to nonconforming buildings and uses. The Board shall
have no powers to authorize as a variance the establishment of a nonconforming
building or use where none previously existed. It shall not permit changes in
use except as outlined in Chapter 1276 and in this section.

oncoming objects to see pedestrians, especially children, when such pedestrians
are on the front or side sidewalk or other part of the dedicated area of the
street commonly used for pedestrian traffic.
      (2)   The erection, planting or growth of any vision-impairing fence in

fence permit locates the survey property pins where the fence is to be located
and proves such fact to the Zoning Inspector at the time of applying for the
fence permit. In the event that the property pins cannot be located, then
before the fence permit can be issued for a fence that abuts or established a
property line, the applicant for the fence permit shall have a boundary survey
prepared and sealed by a surveyor registered in the State of Ohio so that
property pins are established along the property line where the fence is to be
located.

   1258.03   ACCESSORY BUILDINGS AND USES.
   The permitted accessory buildings and uses are any accessory use customarily
incidental to a use authorized by Section 1258.02.
(Ord.79-0-14. Passed 7-24-79.)
   1258.04   INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK
   1258.05   YARD REGULATIONS.
   For every main or accessory building the following minimum yards shall be
provided:
   (a)   Front Yards.
      (1)   There shall be a front yard setback of not less than sixty feet for
all buildings in the business unless otherwise shown on the Zoning Map, and no
portion of the building or structure except gasoline pumps shall project and no
merchandise shall be displayed in front of the setback line. A front yard
variance in excess of twenty percent for any development in the Business
District may be allowed provided that it is approved by the Planning Commission
and by the BZA and provided that it meets the following criteria:
         A.   The developer desires to construct business units on the first
floor and either condominiums or apartments on the second floor (and higher
floors if applicable and the developer's plan is to create a "Main Street" type
of development that is similar to downtown Willoughby where the buildings are
constructed adjacent to the sidewalk;
         B.   The developer's plan includes at least 120 feet of contiguous
frontage along Andrews Road;
         C.   The developer's plan will be in harmony with the existing or
intended character of the neighborhood and that such use will not change the
essential character of the area;
         D.   The developer's plan is determined to be architecturally
compatible with the adjacent properties and the developer's plan meets the
following standards:
            1.   Building setbacks and arrangement should help define the
street, frame corners, encourage pedestrian activity and define both public and
private spaces;
            2.   Minimize setbacks at major intersections so that the
architecture can define the area;
            3.   Contiguous building arrangement along the street-face is
encouraged to avoid large breaks between buildings. Breaks to allow pedestrian
connections are acceptable. Building wall offsets, including projections,
recesses, and changes in floor level shall be used in order to add
architectural interest and variety, and to relieve the visual effect of a
simple, long wall. Similarly, roofline offsets shall be provided, in order to
add architectural interest and variety, and to relieve the effect of a single,
long roof;
            4.   Around common open space, use buildings to define edges and
provide a comfortable scale;
            5.   Monotony of design shall be avoided. Variation of detail, form
and siting shall be used to provide visual interest.
      (2)   Gasoline pumps at any service station or garage may be erected in
front of the building line, but not less than twenty feet from the front lot
line of any street, and the driveways, platforms and curbs on the premises
shall be designed to service vehicles standing only within the premises.
      (3)   The front yard may be developed for parking.
   (b)   Side Yards. Each hotel or motel constructed in the Business District
shall comply with the yard regulations of Multifamily Residential Districts.
Any other building on a lot which adjoins a Residential District shall have a
side yard on that adjoining side of not less than twenty-five feet.
   (c)   Rear Yards. Rear yards shall be not less than thirty feet for any main
or accessory building on a lot which adjoins a Residential District.
   (d)   Buffering and Screening.  Screening and buffering when lot abuts a
Residential District. When a lot in any Business District abuts a Residential
District, screening and buffering along the entire length of the common
boundary shall be provided in accordance with the following regulations.
      (1)   Width of buffer yard.  Each required buffer yard shall have the
minimum width specified below for the district in which it is located:
         A.   When a Business District (I or II) abuts a Residential District,
the buffer yard shall be at least five feet wide.
      (2)   Screening within the buffer yard shall consist of both:
         A.   Privacy fence (on property line). No fence permit of any kind
shall be issued unless the applicant for the fence permit locates the survey
property pins where the fence is to be located and proves such fact to the
Zoning Inspector at the time of applying for the fence permit. In the event
that the property pins cannot be located, then before the fence permit can be
issued, the applicant for the fence permit shall have a boundary survey
prepared and sealed by a surveyor registered in the State of Ohio so that
property pins are established along the property line where the fence is to be
located;
         B.   Dense vegetative planting of a variety which shall be equally
effective in winter and summer.
      (3)   The height of the screening shall be in accordance with the
following:
         A.   Privacy fence shall be eight feet high measured from the natural
grade;
         B.   Vegetation shall be a minimum of six feet high measured from the
natural grade and may exceed eight feet if properly maintained. The required
height shall be achieved no later than twelve months after the initial
installation.
      (4)   All screening shall be free of advertising or other signs.
      (5)   The required landscaping shall be maintained in healthy condition
by the current owner and replaced when necessary. Replacement material shall
conform to the original intent of the landscape plan.
      (6)   Screening and buffering plan must be approved by the Planning and
Zoning Commission prior to enactment.

   1258.06   HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
   The height of any main or accessory building shall not exceed two and one-
half stories or thirty-five feet. Exceptions:
   (a)   Chimneys, church spires, flag poles, ornamental towers, radio towers,

   1258.08   TRASH STORAGE AREAS.
   (a)   Dumpsters and trash receptacles must be screened with six foot tall
enclosures that have a minimum of three sides to ensure the trash area is
secured and minimize visibility from the street. In all Business Districts the
location of a trash storage area must meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Must be located on a paved surface;
      (2)   May not be located within five feet of windows, doors, or
combustible walls or roof eaves;
      (3)   May not displace required landscaping or parking;
      (4)   May not create a sight, traffic, or safety obstruction;
      (5)   Must provide solid, opaque screening and may be composed of masonry

   1268.01   PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It  is the intent of this code to preserve, protect, and enhance the lawful
nighttime use and enjoyment of any and all property through the use of
appropriate lighting practices and systems. Such individual fixtures and
lighting systems shall be designed, constructed, and installed to control
glare, prevent light trespass, minimize obtrusive light, and conserve energy
while maintaining safety, security and productivity.
(Ord. 2008-O-18.  Passed 10-28-08.)
   1268.02   DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply,
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
   (a)   “Cut-off angle” (of a luminaire).  The angle, measured up from the
nadir, between the vertical axis and the first line of site at which the bare
source of the bulb or light source is not visible.
   (b)   “Direct light.”  Light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the
reflector or reflector diffuser, or through the refractor or diffuser lens, of
a luminaire.
   (c)   “Foot candle.” A unit of illuminance equal to one lumen per square
foot or 10.76 lux.
   (d)   “Flood” or “Spotlight.”  Any light fixture or lamp that incorporates a
reflector or a refractor to concentrate the light output into a directed beam
in a particular direction.
   (e)   “Glare.”Light emitting from a luminaire with an intensity great enough
to cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss of visual performance and visibility.
   (f)   “Full cut-off or fully-shielded luminaire.”A luminaire constructed or
shielded in such a manner that all light emitted by the luminaire, either
directly from the lamp or indirectly from the luminaire, is projected below the
horizontal plane through the luminaire's lowest light emitting part as
certified by the manufacturer.
   (g)   “High Intensity Discharge (HID) lighting technology.” Lighting
technology that uses a capsule of gas instead of a filament for a light bulb.
The light is emitted from an arc discharge between two closely spaced
electrodes hermetically sealed inside a small quartz glass tubular envelope
capsule.
   (h)   “Light trespass.”The unwanted shining of direct light produced by a
luminaire beyond the boundaries of the property on which it is located. Light
that is of an intrusive and objectionable nature.
   (i)   “Luminaire.”The complete lighting unit or system and this includes a
lamp or lamps and/or a fixture or fixtures.
   (j)   “Lux.” The SI unit of illuminance.  One lux is one lumen per square
yard.
   (k)   “Maximum mean average lux.”  The maximum average lux level on a
surface based upon the average lumen output of a lamp over its life. Average
lumen output over the life of the lamp is typically about seventy-five percent
of the new lamp lumen output.

less than three feet from the property line, then the applicant for the
driveway permit shall locate the survey property pins where the driveway is to
be located and proves such fact to the Zoning Inspector at the time of applying
for the driveway permit. In the event that the property pins cannot be located,
then before the driveway permit can be issued, the applicant shall have a
boundary survey prepared and sealed by a surveyor registered in the State of
Ohio so that property pins are established along the property line where the
driveway is to be located. All existing driveways that are less than three feet
from the property line as of the date of the passage of this section are
grandfathered in and such a driveway can be repaved or reconstructed at that
same location without the need to locate the survey pins or have a survey
performed unless the City has received actual notice that there is a property
line dispute with the adjacent property owner.
      (3)   A driveway permit shall be obtained before any driveway is
established or relocated or altered or enlarged.
   (b)   Multifamily or Business.

more than twelve feet for a one-directional drive, and not less than eighteen
or a maximum of twenty-two feet for a two-directional drive. Wherever possible
such drives shall be located at least seventy-five feet from an intersection of
two streets (measured on centerlines) spaced at not less than 150-foot
intervals, and generally located where they will interfere the least with
normal traffic movements on the street. Locations of such driveways shall be
approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission before construction.
      (3)   When located in or adjacent to any Residential District, such
parking areas shall be not nearer than five feet to the side or rear lot line,
and all the land lying between the edge of the parking area and the lot line
shall be kept free from debris, and shall be landscaped and maintained with at
least one hedge row of hardy shrubs approximately five feet in height, or a
wall or solid fence. If located opposite any Residential District, the parking
area shall be not nearer to the street than the established building line.

square feet of gross floor area or fraction thereof, of manufacturing, storage,
wholesale or retail buildings and shall be maintained as long as such building
is occupied or unless an equivalent number of spaces is provided in conformance
with these requirements.
(Ord.79-0-14. Passed 7-24-79.)
   1280.07   PARKING PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Trucks that are designed by the manufacturer to carry a load of
greater than one ton (the rated capacity of the truck) are not allowed for
overnight parking in Residential Districts of the City.  One truck not
exceeding a one ton rated capacity may be parked overnight by an occupant of a
dwelling within a Residential District, provided that such truck is used solely
by the occupant of the dwelling and that the truck is parked entirely within
the property boundary lines of such occupant and is otherwise legally parked.

   (d)   Garages and open off-street parking areas for the parking and storage
of automobiles accessory to a one, two or multifamily dwelling shall be an
accessory use permitted by right in the Residential Districts in which the
particular dwelling type is permitted. Parking shall not be permitted in a
required front or side yard in Residential Districts. An exception herein may
be made by a resident of a Residential District by making application to the
Chief of Police, who with his concurrence, may grant such exception for a
reasonable time as warranted by the facts and circumstances.
   (e)   The repairing of an automobile owned by a resident family shall be
permitted in Residential Districts. The rebuilding or dismantling of any
automobile in an open yard is prohibited in Residential Districts. The
standards governing the interpretation of this subsection shall include
ownership of the vehicle, its location on the property, where work on it was
performed and the facts as to the use and condition of the vehicle immediately
preceding the time of the performance of the work, so as to permit a reasonable
distinction between repairing, rebuilding and dismantling.

debris from fallen or damaged trees, streambank erosion, and the downstream
transport of sediments eroded from watercourse banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling, and
transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses.
      (5)   Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food.
      (6)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain a
diverse aquatic system.
      (7)   Provide riparian habitat to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining

(Ord.2004-O-21. Passed 11-9-04.)
   1286.10   VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may grant a variance to this
chapter as provided herein. In granting a variance, the following conditions
shall apply:
      (1)   In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship with respect
to the use of a property or practical difficulty with respect to maintaining
the riparian setback as established in this chapter, such as to justify the
granting of a variance, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the
potential harm or reduction in riparian functions that may be caused by a
proposed structure or use.
      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may not authorize any structure
or use in a Zoning District other than those authorized in the Zoning Code.
      (3)   Variances shall be void if not implemented within one year of the
date of issuance.
   (b)   In making a determination under Section 1286.09(a) of this chapter,
the Planning and Zoning Commission may consider the following:
      (1)   The natural vegetation of the property as well as the percentage of
the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain. The criteria of Chapter 1444,
Flood Damage Prevention, may be used as guidance when granting variances in the
100-year floodplain.
      (2)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, erosion control, water quality protection, or other functions of the
riparian setback. This determination shall be based on sufficient technical and
scientific data.
      (3)   The degree of hardship, with respect to the use of a property or
the degree of practical difficulty with respect to maintaining the riparian
setback as established in this chapter, placed on the landowner by this chapter
and the availability of alternatives to the proposed structure or use.
      (4)   Soil-disturbing activities permitted in the riparian setback
through variances should be implemented to minimize clearing to the extent
possible and to include Best Management Practices necessary to minimize erosion
and control sediment.
      (5)   The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation
such as maintained lawns, in the riparian setback compromises its benefits to
the City. Variances should not be granted for asphalt or concrete paving in the
riparian setback. Variances may be granted for gravel driveways when necessary.
      (6)   Whether a property, otherwise buildable under the ordinances of the
City, will be made unbuildable because of this chapter.
   (c)   In order to maintain the riparian setback to the maximum extent
practicable, the Planning and Zoning Commission may consider granting
variations to other area or setback requirements imposed on a property by the
Zoning Code.
   (d)   In granting a variance under this chapter, the Planning and Zoning
Commission, for good cause, may impose such conditions that it deems
appropriate to maintain the purposes of this chapter.
(Ord.2004-O-21. Passed 11-9-04.)

terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the use
intended the test of acceptability;
   (c)   Permit, to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units, which tend tor educe the cost of construction and
erection without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and
security of the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and
without preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or
methods of construction; and
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practical, the standardization of
construction practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including
methods employed to produce industrialized units.

   1444.01   FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (b)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord.95-O-13.  Passed 12-26-95.)
   1444.02   PURPOSES.
   The purposes of this chapter are to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)      Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (g)   Ensure that persons who occupy an area of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord.95-O-13.  Passed 12-26-95.)
   1444.03   METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.

statutes. Where a provision of this chapter is in conflict with a State law,
such State law shall take precedence.
(Ord.95-O-13.  Passed 12-26-95.)
   1444.10   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee
thereof or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made under this chapter.
(Ord.95-O-13.  Passed 12-26-95.)
   1444.11   DEVELOPMENT PERMIT REQUIRED; APPLICATION; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   A development permit shall be obtained from the Zoning Inspector
before construction or development begins within any area of special flood
hazard established in Section 1444.06. An application for a development permit
shall be made on forms furnished by the Zoning Inspector and may include, but
not be limited to, site specific topographic plans drawn to scale showing the
nature, location, dimensions and elevations of the area in question; existing
or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities and the
locations thereof.  If base flood elevation data are available, the following
information is required:
      (1)   The elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor,
including the basement, of all proposed structures;
      (2)   The elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any proposed
structure will be floodproofed in accordance with Section 1444.16(b);
      (3)   Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
floodproofing criteria in Section 1444.16(b); and
      (4)   A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of proposed development and certification by a
registered professional engineer that the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse will not be diminished.
   (b)   An application for a development permit is not required for
maintenance work such as roofing, painting and basement sealing, or for small
nonstructural development activities (except for filling and grading) valued at
less than one thousand dollars ($1,000).  Any proposed action exempt from
filing for a development permit is also exempt from the standards of this
chapter.
(Ord.95-O-13.  Passed 12-26-95.)
   1444.12   ENFORCEMENT.
   The Zoning Inspector is hereby appointed to administer and implement this
chapter by granting or denying a development permit application in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord.95-O-13.  Passed 12-26-95.)
   1444.13   DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF ZONING INSPECTOR.
   The duties and responsibilities of the Zoning Inspector shall include, but
are not limited to, the following:
   (a)   Permit Review. The Zoning Inspector shall:
      (1)   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
      (2)   Review all development permits to ensure that all necessary permits
have been obtained from those Federal, State or local governmental agencies
from which prior approval is required. The applicant shall be  responsible for
obtaining such permits as are required, including permits issued by the
Department of the Army under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
      (3)   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are delineated
in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the
Flood Insurance Study. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of
flood information. If the proposed development is located within a designated
floodway, the Zoning Inspector shall ensure that the encroachment provisions of
Section 1444.17(a) are met.
   (b)   Use of Other Base Flood Data. Areas of special flood hazard where base
flood elevation data have not been provided by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, in accordance with Section 1444.06, are designated as Zone A on the
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map. Within these areas, the Zoning Inspector
shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and
floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, including data
obtained under Section 1444.16(f), in order to administer Sections 1444.16(a)
and (b) and Section 1444.17.
   (c)   Information to be Obtained and Maintained. Where base flood elevation
data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on a community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map, regardless of the source of such data, the following
provisions apply:
      (1)   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including the basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and state whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor;
      (2)   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential
structures:
         A.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which the structure was floodproofed; and
         B.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Section
1444.11(a)(3); and
      (3)   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to this
chapter.
   (d)   Alteration of Watercourses. The Zoning Inspector shall:
      (1)   Notify adjacent communities and the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.  A watercourse is considered to be altered if any change
occurs within its banks.
      (2)   Maintain engineering documentation required by Section 1444.11(a)
(4) so that the flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of
said watercourse will not be diminished.
      (3)   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for the altered
or relocated portion of such watercourse, so that the flood-carrying capacity
will not be diminished.
   (e)   Interpretation of Flood Boundaries. The Zoning Inspector shall make
interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of
the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a
conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map
boundary and field elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood
elevation profile shall prevail. The person contesting the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section 1444.14.
(Ord.95-O-13.  Passed 12-26-95.)
   1444.14   APPEALS; VARIANCES.
   (a)   Procedures.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals, as established by the City shall hear
and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination
made by the Zoning Inspector in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter.
      (3)   Persons aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals, or
any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Lake County Court of Common
Pleas, as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
      (4)   In passing upon applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter and:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property, in times of flood, for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph (a)(4)
hereof, and the purposes of this chapter, the Board  may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter.
      (6)   The Zoning Inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variance to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.
   (b)   Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Generally, a variance may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, provided that the provisions of paragraph (a)(4)
hereof have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (2)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (3)   A variance shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (4)   A variance shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (5)   A variance shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense; create
nuisances; cause fraud on or victimization of the public, as identified in
paragraph (a)(4) hereof; or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
(Ord.95-O-13.  Passed 12-26-95.)
   1444.15   STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   In all areas of special flood hazard, the following standards are required:
   (a)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      (2)   All manufactured homes not otherwise regulated by the Ohio Revised
Code pertaining to manufactured home parks shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Methods
of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors.
   (b)   Construction Materials and Methods.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
   (c)   Utilities. The following standards apply to all water supply, sanitary
sewerage and waste disposal systems not otherwise regulated by the Ohio Revised
Code:
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems.
      (2)   New and replacement sanitary sewerage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into flood waters.
      (3)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (d)   Subdivision Proposals.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems, located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
damage.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall meet the specific standards of Section 1444.16(f).
   (e)   Areas of Special Flood Hazard Without Base Flood Elevation Data.  In
all areas of special flood hazard identified as Zone A on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map, where base flood elevation data are not available from any source,
new construction and substantial improvement of any residential, commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall have the lowest floor,
including the basement, elevated to at least two feet above the highest
adjacent natural grade.
(Ord.95-O-13.  Passed 12-26-95.)
   1444.16   FLOODPROOFING STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have
been provided as set forth in Sections 1444.06 and 1444.13(b), the following
provisions are required:
   (a)   Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including the
basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation.
   (b)   Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated to the
level of the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, shall:
      (1)   Be floodproofed so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water to the level of the base
flood elevation. In order to be eligible for lower flood insurance rates, the
structure should be floodproofed at least one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
      (3)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted

highway use.
   (e)   Enclosures Below the Lowest Floor. The following standards apply to
all new and substantially improved residential and nonresidential structures
which are elevated to the base flood elevation using pilings, columns or
posts.  Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are useable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must:
      (1)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect; or
      (2)   Meet or exceed the following criteria:
         A.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.

   1444.17   FLOODWAYS.
   The Flood Insurance Study referenced in Section 1444.06 identifies a segment
within areas of special flood hazard known as a floodway. Floodways may also be
delineated in other sources of flood information as specified in Section
1444.13(b). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential.
The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
   (a)   Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development, are prohibited, unless a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis is performed in accordance with standard engineering
practices and demonstrates that the proposed encroachment will not result in
any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (b)   If subsection (a) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Section 1444.16.
   (c)   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an increase
in base flood elevations shall be granted only upon prior approval by FEMA.
Such requests must be submitted by the Zoning Inspector to FEMA and must meet
the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.

delineated a floodway, the following provisions apply:
   (a)   New construction, substantial improvements or other development
(including fill) shall only be permitted if it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
   (b)   If subsection (a) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions set forth in Section 1444.15.
(Ord.95-O-13.  Passed 12-26-95.)
   1444.99   PENALTY; EQUITABLE REMEDIES.
   (a)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this

   1453.06   FIRE DAMAGED STRUCTURES; TRANSFER OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS.
   The City is hereby authorized to utilize the procedure described in Ohio R.
C. 3929.86 (C) and (D) whereby no insurance company doing business in the State
shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a building or other
structure located in the City where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to
the building or other structure, under all policies, exceeds five thousand
dollars ($5, 000), unless there is compliance with the following procedures:
   (a)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
company or companies equals or exceeds sixty percent of the aggregate limits of
liability on all fire policies covering the building or other structure, the
insurance company or companies, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26(F), shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Administrative Director, in the
aggregate, two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each fifteen thousand dollars
($15,000), and each fraction of that amount, of a claim. If, at the time of a
proof of loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the insurance
company or companies, the named insured or insureds has submitted a
contractor's signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing the
building or other structure, then the insurance company or companies shall

insuring the building or other structure. Policy proceeds remaining after the
transfer to the City shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.
   The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed estimate of
the cost of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure
after the transfer, and the Administrative Director shall return the amount of
the fund in excess of the estimate to the named insured or insureds, provided
that the City has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or
other structure.
   (b)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the City, as authorized by this section,
the Administrative Director shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be
used solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or
securing the structure incurred by the City, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
   When transferring the funds, as required in subsection (a) hereof, an
insurance company shall provide the City with the name and address of the named
insured or insureds, whereupon the City shall contact the named insured or

implemented until the site reaches final stabilization. All properties adjacent
to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil erosion
and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands.
   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of contractor
(s) responsible for implementation the SWP3 and providing that information to
the City Engineer. The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact stormwater runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3. The applicant shall review the SWP3 with the primary contractor prior
to commencement of construction activities and keep a SWP3 training log to
demonstrate that this review had occurred.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities. The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures.  The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a 50-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the State, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible (e.g., stream
crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation
and restoration). Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment
removal and maximize stormwater infiltration.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices.  The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. The amount of soil
exposed during construction activity shall be minimized. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.  Erosion control practices must meet the following
requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization.  Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
 
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed.
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels.  Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices.  The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion. Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion. Such
practices may include rock, check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive
flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices.  The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site.
      Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap sediment
from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. Such practices may
include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet
protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to a
sediment settling pond. The design, installation and maintenance of erosion and
sediment controls shall address factors such as the amount, frequency,
intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater
runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes
expected to be present on the site.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are
not considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment settling pond.  Sediment control practices must meet the following
requirements:
      (1)   Timing.  Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven days from the
start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the City Engineer and/or the county
SWCD, is required for any one of the following conditions:
         A.   Concentrated stormwater runoff.
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas which exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3) inlet protection, or other sediment barriers;
         C.   Runoff from common drainage locations with ten or more acres of
disturbed land;
            Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a sediment
trap or sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater and Land
Development. The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a sediment
trap shall be limited to less than five acres. Contributing-drainage areas of
five acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin. An equivalent best-
management practice may be utilized upon approval from the City.
            The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage
zone and a dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least
1,800 cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum 48-
hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always withdraw runoff
from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle. As such, a skimmer
discharge device consistent with Rainwater and Land Development shall be
provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide both a
sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure shall be
constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest edition
of Rainwater and Land Development.
            When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used
as temporary sediment trapping BMPs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase and
until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the City.
            The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of
sediment basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the
pond provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering
zone. As such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be
no discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage
zone and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only
occur through the skimmer.
            The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one
of the following methods:
            Method 1:  The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be
1,000ft3 per disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
            Method 2:  The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the
volume necessary to store the sediment as calculated with RUSLE or other
generally accepted erosion prediction model.
            When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site
areas and areas which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be
included unless runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment
settling pond and is not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of
the dewatering zone must be less than or equal to five feet. The configuration
between the inlets and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at
least two units of length for each one unit of width  2:1 length-to-width
ratio; however, a length to width ratio of  4:1 is recommended. Sediment must
be removed from the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity of the
sediment storage zone has been completely filled by sediment accumulations.
This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin
depth. When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider
public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the
sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment
and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is
encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions.  Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties
and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow. Where intended to
provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and
shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The relationship between the
maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in
Table 3 below. Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the size
of the permissible drainage area.
 
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 ≥ 2% but < 20%
0.125                                ≥ 20% but < 50%
 
      (4)   Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the City, but their use shall not exceed the limitations
indicated in Table 3 above. Detail drawings and plan notes shall specify the
diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative perimeter
controls if used instead of silt fence.
      (5)   Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten acres.
      (6)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond. Straw or hay
bales and filter socks around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet
protection.
      (7)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control.  Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and
constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances shall
be kept free of sediment tracked off site. Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall
be cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
               Based on site conditions, City Engineer and/or the county SWCD
may require additional best management practices to control off site tracking
and dust. These additional BMPs may include:
            1.   Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
            2.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas. Wash water from
these areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-
settling pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with division
(g) of this section.  No surfactants or detergents may be used to wash
vehicles.
            3.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The City Engineer and/or the county SWCD
may require dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed
areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and
regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (8)   Surface waters of the State protection.  Construction vehicles
shall avoid water resources. A 50 foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be
provided around surface waters of the State unless infeasible. If it is
infeasible to provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the
SWP3 shall comply with the stabilization requirements in division (b)(1) of
this section for areas within 50 feet of a surface water or riparian or wetland
setbacks if applicable, whichever is greater; and minimize soil compaction and,
unless infeasible, preserve topsoil. [Communities with riparian and/or wetland
setbacks include the following language: If a riparian or wetland setback is
greater than 50 feet, no disturbance of natural vegetation shall occur within
the riparian or wetland setback unless a variance to the riparian or wetland
setback regulation has been granted.] If the applicant is permitted to disturb
areas within 50 feet of a water resource, the following conditions shall be
addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in water resources
or wetlands.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
         G.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands. The flow should
be released such that no erosion occurs downslope. Level spreaders may need to
be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
         H.   Protected areas or critical areas, including wetlands and
riparian areas shall be physically marked in the field prior to earth
disturbing activities.
      (9)   Modifying controls.  If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (f)   Non-sediment Pollutant Controls.  No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in stormwater runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources, wetlands or
the MS4. These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste materials.  A covered dumpster shall be made available for
the proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other
waste materials.
      (2)   Concrete truck wash out. The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or water of the
State is prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available.
      (3)   Disposal of other wastewaters. The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the State is prohibited. The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
      (4)   Fuel/liquid tank storage.  All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest
containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up
spills. The SWP3 shall contain spill prevention and response procedures and
these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction meeting.
      (5)   Toxic or hazardous waste disposal. Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly. The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      (6)   Contaminated soils disposal and runoff. Discovery of previously
unknown contaminated soils onsite shall be self-reported to Ohio EPA and local
authorities. Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of
properly. Runoff from contaminated soils shall not be discharged from the site.
Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid waste
landfill sites or redevelopment sites. Where construction activities are to
occur on sites with contamination from previous activities, operators shall be
aware that concentrations of materials that meet other criteria (i.e. not
considered a hazardous waste, meeting Voluntary Action Program (VAP standards))
may still result in stormwater discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality
Standards. Such discharges are not authorized by this code. Control measures
which may be utilized to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to:
         A.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated runoff
and prevent discharge;
         B.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer with
the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
         C.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or other
such methods to prevent storm water from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
            The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building
materials, building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Applicants may
also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., spill prevention control and
countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, safety response plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site.
   (g)   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (h)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (i)   Internal Inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection frequency
may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is temporarily
stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g., site is
covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of inspection
requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions are
expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been attained
from the City Engineer and/or the Lake SWCD and all of the following conditions
are met:
      (1)   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one
month).
      (2)   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
      (3)   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
      (4)   For sites that will not be completed by October 1, a Pre-Winter
Stabilization Meeting shall be held by the landowner and the developer,
engineer and contractor of the project and the City prior to October 1, in
order to plan and approve winter erosion and sediment controls as defined in
the most current online edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct
these inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to
evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures
are required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls. Certified inspection reports shall be submitted to the City Engineer
within seven working days from the inspection and retained at the development
site.
      These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the City or an alternate form acceptable
to the City Engineer. The inspection form shall include:
         A.   The inspection date.
         B.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
         C.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
         D.   Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring
at the time of inspection.
         E.   Locations of:
            1.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
            2.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
            3.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate
for a particular location.
            4.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
         F.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
SWP3 and implementation dates.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (5)   The applicant shall maintain for three years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
   (j)   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. All
sediment control practices must be maintained in a functional condition until
all up slope areas they control reach final stabilization. The applicant shall
provide a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the continued
performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party and
adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the City
Engineer.  When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or
installation of erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures
shall be followed:
      (1)   When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If an internal inspection
reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of a
sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three days of
the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within
ten days of the inspection.
      (2)   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function. If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within three to ten days of the inspection as determined by the City
Engineer or site inspector.
      (3)   When BMPs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in accordance with the
schedule, the control practice must be implemented within ten days from the
date of the inspection. If the internal inspection reveals that the planned
control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (k)   Final Stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
City Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final stabilization, the
applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further inspection requirement
applies to that portion of the site. Final stabilization also requires the
installation of permanent (post-construction) stormwater control measures
(SCMs). Obligations under this chapter shall not be completed until
installation of post-construction BMPs is verified.
(Ord. 2017-O-06.  Passed 3-28-17.)
   1459.10   ABBREVIATED EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PLAN (SWP3).
   (a)   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the
applicant shall submit an abbreviated SWP3 in accordance with the requirements
of this regulation.
   (b)   The abbreviated SWP3 shall be certified by a professional engineer, a
registered surveyor, certified professional erosion and sediment control
specialist, or a registered landscape architect.
   (c)   The abbreviated SWP3 shall include a minimum of the following BMPs.
The City may require other BMPs as site conditions warrant.
      (1)   Construction entrances. Construction entrances shall be built and
shall serve as the only permitted points of ingress and egress to the
development area. These entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of
aggregate stone or recycled concrete or cement sized greater than two inches in
diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance with
specifications in the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
      (2)   Concrete truck wash out. The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be indicated on the
plan. Use for other waste and wastewater is prohibited.
      (3)   Street sweeping.  Streets directly adjacent to construction
entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned
daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on
these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall be cleaned weekly.
      (4)   Stabilization. The development area shall be stabilized as detailed
in Table 4.
 
Table 4: Stabilization

stream.
Disturbed areas that will be idle over Prior to November 1
winter
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion
matting.
 
      (5)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets. Straw, hay
bales, and filter socks are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (6)   Silt fence and other perimeter controls. Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the City shall be used to protect adjacent
properties and water resources from sediment discharged via sheet (diffused)
flow. Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the permissible
drainage area is limited to those indicated in Table 3 in Section
1459.09 .
      (7)   Internal inspection and maintenance. All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period. Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the

responsibilities of owners and occupants of the dwellings with respect to
sanitation, repair and maintenance; to provide for rehabilitation and reuse of
existing structures and the application of this chapter's requirements to
alterations and repairs; to fix the responsibilities of owners, operators and

and penalties for this chapter.
(Ord.97-O-09.  Passed 11-11-97.)
   1462.02   APPLICATION; INTERPRETATION.
   (a)   All rental units in the City of Mentor-on-the-Lake shall comply with
the minimum standards that are established in the BOCA National Property
Maintenance Code, as adopted in Section 1460.01, as well as with all laws that
have been promulgated by the City under this Part Fourteen - the Building and
Housing Code and under Part Sixteen - the Fire Prevention Code.
   (b)   This chapter shall be construed liberally and justly to insure public
health, safety and welfare insofar as they are affected by the continued use
and maintenance of rental structures and premises.
(Ord.97-O-09.  Passed 11-11-97.)
   1462.03   ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Certificate of Occupancy Required. After the effective date of this
chapter, no owner, agent or person in charge of any single-family or
multifamily rental structure shall rent, lease or permit to be occupied, any
dwelling unit within said single-family or multifamily rental structure without
a current and valid certificate of occupancy issued by the Zoning Inspector or
a duly designated representative. 
   (b)   Application and Issuance of Certificates of Occupancy Generally.
      (1)   Application for a certificate of occupancy shall be made
triennially to the Zoning Inspector, or a duly designated representative, on
forms provided therefor. Said application shall be accompanied by the required
fees as set forth in subsection (d) hereof. Applications to renew valid
certificates of occupancy shall be filed with the Zoning Inspector, or a duly
designated representative, not less than sixty days prior to the expiration
date of the current certification of occupancy.
      (2)   Upon receipt of an application for a certificate of occupancy, the
Zoning Inspector, or a duly designated representative, shall schedule
inspections of the rental dwelling unit as necessary to determine its
compliance with this chapter.
      (3)   If a rental dwelling unit is found to be in compliance with this
chapter, a certificate of occupancy shall be issued for said unit, which shall
be valid for a period not to exceed three years.
      (4)   If, upon inspection of the rental dwelling unit, it is determined
that a violation of this chapter exists, notice of said violation shall be made
to the owner or agent of the rental dwelling unit. The owner or agent shall
obtain the proper permits as required by these Codified Ordinances and the laws
of the State of Ohio to correct the noted violations. No certificate of
occupancy shall be issued until the violations have been corrected and the
repairs inspected and approved.
      (5)   In addition to the triennial inspection, an application for a
certificate of occupancy shall also be made to the Zoning Inspector, or a duly
designated representative, not less than thirty days after a change in
ownership has been completed.
   (c)   Application and Issuance of Certificates of Occupancy for Existing
Occupancies. Within 120 days of the adoption of this chapter, the owner or
agent of each single-family and multifamily rental structure shall submit to
the Zoning Inspector, or a duly designated representative, an application for a
certificate of occupancy for each such single-family and multifamily rental
structure. Units occupied at the time of adoption of this chapter may continue
to be occupied until such time as an inspection has been made by the Zoning
Inspector, or a duly designated representative, after which all units shall
comply with all of the provisions of this chapter.
   (d)   Fees. A fee, not to exceed thirty dollars ($30.00), shall be charged
for the triennial inspection of each rental unit and also for changes of
ownership. The fee shall be equal to the cost of the inspection plus an
additional ten percent of such amount for administrative costs of the City. The
Administrative Director shall certify to Council on an annual basis the cost of
the inspection, and this amount shall then be used as the fee for the
inspection.
   (e)   Duties of Zoning Inspector. It shall be the duty and responsibility of
the Zoning Inspector, or the representative duly designated by the Mayor, to
enforce the provisions of this chapter as herein provided.
   (f)   Notice of Violations.
      (1)   Whenever the Zoning Inspector, or a duly designated representative,
determines that a single-family rental dwelling unit or a multifamily rental
structure, or any portion thereof, is in violation of any provision of this
chapter, he or she shall give written notice as is required in the BOCA
National Property Code, as adopted in Section 1460.01, to the owner, agent or
person in charge of the single-family rental dwelling unit or the multifamily
rental structure, stating the nature of said violation and establishing a
period of time for correction or repair.
      (2)   Service of said notice shall be pursuant to the methods of service
that are provided in the BOCA National Property Maintenance Code, as adopted in
Section 1460.01.
         In the event that the certified mail notice is refused, and the
certified or express mail envelope is returned with an endorsement showing such
refusal, or the return of the person serving process states that service of
process has been refused, service shall occur by sending the notice out by
regular mail to be served to the owner and/or occupant at the address set forth
in the notice. The mailing shall be evidenced by a certificate of mailing which
shall be completed and filed by the City. Service shall be deemed complete when
the notice is mailed, as evidenced by the certificate of mailing. If a

shall be completed and filed by the City. Service shall be deemed complete when
the notice is mailed, as evidenced by the certificate of mailing.
   (g)   Correction of Violations. All alterations or repairs to an existing
building which are caused directly or indirectly by the enforcement of this
chapter shall be done in accordance with the applicable procedures and
provisions of these Codified Ordinances and the applicable laws of the State of
Ohio.
   (h)   Failure to Correct or Comply. Whenever the owner of a single-family
rental dwelling unit or multifamily rental structure fails, neglects or refuses
to comply with any notice of the Zoning Inspector, or a duly designated
representative, within the time period specified in any notice of violation,
said owner shall be considered to be in violation of this chapter, and the City

violation of any of the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to

provided that a written application for appeal is filed within ten days after
the day the decision, notice or order was served with the clerk of the Board of
Zoning Appeals on forms that are provided for such purpose. An application for
appeal shall be based on a claim that the true intent of the BOCA National
Property Maintenance Code or the rules legally adopted thereunder have been
incorrectly interpreted, the provisions of the BOCA National Property
Maintenance Code do not fully apply, or the requirements of this chapter are
adequately satisfied by other means. Said appeal shall be scheduled for a
hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals. The fee for filing an appeal shall
be ten dollars ($10.00).
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not be required to publish the notice of
hearing in a paper of general circulation, but the Board of Zoning Appeals

of the hearing at least seven days in advance of the hearing at the address

right to such written notice.

Ordinances shall prevail as to all questions that relate to the conduct of the
hearing. A record of the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be filed
pursuant to Section 1244.03 of these Codified Ordinances. The quorum
requirements and vote of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be pursuant to the
requirements set forth in Section 1244.02 of these Codified Ordinances.

Council re-authorizes it by the affirmative vote of at least four
Councilpersons. In the event that the Council re-authorizes this chapter, then
the Mayor, pursuant to the Charter, has the right to veto the re-authorized

(Ord.97-O-09.  Passed 11-11-97.)
   1462.05   ADMINISTRATIVE SEARCH WARRANT TO ALLOW INSPECTION.
   (a)   Inspection. If the owner, occupant, or agent does not consent to the
proposed inspection for any reason, the Zoning Inspector or his designee
official may appear before any judge in a court of competent jurisdiction and
seek an administrative search warrant to allow an inspection. Any such
application shall be made within ten calendar days after the non-consent. The
application for the warrant shall specify the basis upon which the warrant is
being sought and shall include a statement that the inspection will be limited
to a determination whether there are violations of the code provisions
identified in this section. The court may consider any of the following factors
along with such other matters as it deems pertinent in its decision as to
whether a warrant shall issue:
      (1)   Eyewitness account of violation;
      (2)   Citizen complaints;
      (3)   Tenant complaints;
      (4)   Plain view violations;
      (5)   Violations apparent from City records;

   (b)   If the court declines to issue a warrant or if no warrant is sought,
the inspection shall still take place but the scope thereof shall be limited to
such areas as are in plain view. A limited-scope inspection conducted pursuant
to this division shall be considered an "inspection" for purposes of this
chapter and all other provisions of this chapter. No criminal penalty shall
attach, nor shall any certificate of occupancy be denied solely by reason of
the owner's, occupants, or agent's refusal to consent to a full inspection.
(Ord. 2017-O-31.  Passed 9-26-17.)

or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues after due notice
has been served, in accordance with the terms and provisions of this chapter or
with other applicable law.
   (b)   The imposition of any penalty, as provided in subsection (a) hereof,
shall not preclude the Law Director from instituting an appropriate action or
proceeding in a court of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful repair or
maintenance; to restrain, correct or abate a violation; to prevent the
occupancy of a building, structure or premises; or to require compliance with
the provisions of this chapter or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules or

designated representative, the Mayor, the Administrative Director, the Board of
Zoning Appeals or the Planning Commission.

   1464.05   RESPECTIVE OBLIGATIONS OF SELLER AND PURCHASER; EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   No person, agent, firm or corporation shall, in a bona fide sale for a
good and valid consideration, transfer or convey any interest in a dwelling

such buildings are located, without first providing the purchaser or
prospective purchaser with a current certificate of inspection or an exact copy
thereof as provided in this chapter.
   (b)   The seller shall deposit in escrow a statement signed by the purchaser
acknowledging receipt of the certificate of inspection, and such signed
statement shall list thereon the date the certificate was given to the
purchaser.
   (c)   If, under the terms of the contract of sale, the seller is obligated
to correct all violations listed on the certificate of inspection, the seller
shall deposit in escrow, before transfer of title to the purchaser, either a
compliance document as described in Section 1464.03 and/or a written statement
agreed upon by the seller and the purchaser filed with the escrow agent setting
forth an agreed upon sum of money that is sufficient to cover the costs of
correcting those specific violations listed on the certificate of inspection
which remain uncorrected.
   (d)   If, under the terms of the contract of sale, the purchaser's
obligation for the correction of violations listed on the certificate of
inspection is limited to the contribution of a specifically stated dollar
amount, or is limited to the purchaser's obligation to correct specific, but
not all, Code violations, then the seller shall deposit in escrow either a
compliance document as described in Section 1464.03(a), if, in fact, all such
violations have been corrected, or a compliance document as described in
Section 1464.03(b), together with a written statement agreed upon by the seller

of money that is sufficient to cover the costs of correcting the violations
listed on the certificate of inspection which remain uncorrected and for which
the seller is responsible.
   (e)   If, under the terms of the contract of sale, the seller has either not
agreed to correct all violations as provided in subsection (c) hereof, or the
purchaser's obligation is not limited to the payment of a stated sum of money
or to the correction of specific violations as provided in subsection (d)
hereof, then the contract of sale between the seller and the purchaser shall be
conditional upon the seller and the purchaser agreeing in writing after the
certificate of inspection has been exhibited to the purchaser, as to their
respective obligations for the correction of the remaining uncorrected
violations listed on such certificate. The seller and the purchaser shall
thereafter deposit in escrow, before transfer of title to the purchaser, their
written agreement as to each party's respective responsibility for the
correction of those violations listed on the certificate of inspection
remaining uncorrected, and such agreement may have attached thereto a
compliance document as described in Section 1464.03(b) evidencing the seller's
correction of those violations for which he or she is responsible, and/or an
agreed upon sum of money that is sufficient to cover the cost of correcting
those violations remaining uncorrected for which the seller is responsible.
   (f)   This chapter sets forth requirements and procedures applicable to
relationships between the seller and the purchaser at the time of the sale of

of property to require the correction of Code violations, as the owner of
property is defined in these Codified Ordinances.

be contained in each certificate of inspection.
   (b)   In issuing a compliance document under the provisions of this chapter,

   1464.09   ADMINISTRATIVE SEARCH WARRANT TO ALLOW INSPECTION.
   (a)   Inspection. If the owner, occupant, or agent does not consent to the
proposed inspection for any reason, the Zoning Inspector or his designee
official may appear before any judge in a court of competent jurisdiction and
seek an administrative search warrant to allow an inspection. Any such
application shall be made within ten calendar days after the non-consent. The
application for the warrant shall specify the basis upon which the warrant is
being sought and shall include a statement that the inspection will be limited
to a determination whether there are violations of the code provisions
identified in this section. The court may consider any of the following factors
along with such other matters as it deems pertinent in its decision as to
whether a warrant shall issue:
      (1)   Eyewitness account of violation;
      (2)   Citizen complaints;
      (3)   Tenant complaints;
      (4)   Plain view violations;

such areas as are in plain view. A limited-scope inspection conducted pursuant
to this division shall be considered an "inspection" for purposes of this
chapter and all other provisions of this chapter. No criminal penalty shall
attach, nor shall any certificate of occupancy be denied, solely by reason of
the owner's, occupants, or agent's refusal to consent to a full inspection.

prosecute the owner, lessee, or party in control of any vacant building, or a
mortgagee that has filed and is currently maintaining an open foreclosure
action regarding a vacant building for failure to comply with the notice of
violation. Such notice or order may be issued by the Zoning Inspector or his or
her designee without reporting the notice or order to Council. In case the City
corrects the violations and the cost is not paid within thirty days, the cost
to correct the violations may be assessed against the real estate from which
the violations originated.
   (b)   The notice may be served by delivering it personally to the owner,
lessee, party in control or occupant or by leaving it at the owner's, lessee's,
party in control or occupant's usual place of business or residence, or by
posting it in a conspicuous place on the real estate, building or structure
involved, or by mailing it to the owner, lessee, party in control or occupant,
or by publishing it once in a newspaper of general circulation within the City
if it cannot be served in any of the ways above mentioned.  The notice of
violation to a mortgagee that has filed and is currently maintaining an open
foreclosure action regarding a vacant building shall be served on the mortgagee
at the address that is listed on the complaint for foreclosure and to the
attorney for the mortgagee at the address for the attorney that is listed on
the complaint for foreclosure.  The notice to the mortgagee and the attorney
for the mortgagee shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested

opinion of the Zoning Inspector or his or her designee, the condition of a
structure or premises, or part thereof, constitutes an immediate hazard to
human life or health, including but not limited to, the placement, either
temporarily or otherwise, of rubbish, garbage, litter or other personal
property on the premises in violation of this chapter or any other section of
this Code, then no such notice of violation need be given to the owner, lessee,
or party in control of any vacant building, or a mortgagee that has filed and
is currently maintaining an open foreclosure action regarding a vacant
building. Upon such finding and declaring of an emergency nuisance condition,

order of, or written notice issued by, the Zoning Inspector and/or his or her
designee within twenty days from the date such notice was given, mailed or
issued, and to appear before the Board within thirty days of the notice of
appeal that has been filed with the City, to show cause why he/she/it should
not comply with such notice.  Such appeal must be in writing.  Failure to file
a written appeal with the Board within the time prescribed herein shall
constitute a waiver of the right to appeal.  However, filing of an appeal from
any such notice shall suspend action on enforcement of such notice until the
appeal is acted upon by the Board.

maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the City’s future expenses
related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.

projects initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable,
for projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the City Engineer. Such projects must be designed to minimize the
number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear construction
projects must comply with the requirements of this chapter.

(Ord. 2017-O-05.  Passed 3-14-17.)
   1472.09   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General.  The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources. 
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site.
Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and complies with Chapter 1286 of the
City of Mentor on the Lake's riparian setback ordinance requirements.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows in accordance
with the requirements of this chapter.
         SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional
criteria required by the City Engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use.  SCMs shall be designed to
achieve the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be
compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine
maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots.  Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Part Twelve, Title Two, Chapters 1220 to 1230 City
of Mentor on the Lake Subdivision Code, shall provide stormwater management and
water quality controls for the development of all subdivided lots. This shall
include provisions for lot grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding
during the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable,
the pre-development runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources.  SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable Federal, State, and local agencies as
required in Section
1472.01 , and the activity is in compliance with Chapter 1459 City of Mentor on
the Lake's erosion and sediment control requirements and Chapter 1286 City of
Mentor on the Lake's riparian setback requirements, all as determined by the
City Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels.  All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption.  The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of this section if it can be shown to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer that the site is part of a larger common plan
of development where the stormwater management requirements for the site are
provided by an existing SCMs, or if the stormwater management requirements for
the site are provided by practices defined in a regional or local stormwater
management plan approved by the City Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance. All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the City Engineer as
detailed in Section
1472.08 .
      (8)   Ownership.  Unless otherwise required by the City, SCMs serving
multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and maintained by
an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property owners, by the
City.  SCMs serving single lots shall be placed on these lots, protected within
an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of existing natural drainage.  Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and
grubbing practices; and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and
through these areas. Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide
perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected and
ecological functions are maintained.
      (10)   Preservation of wetland hydrology.  Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters the wetlands in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology.
            If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a
hydrological analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed
discharge matches the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics that
support the wetland.
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria.  All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection.  The City Engineer may allow modification
to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only if the
applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio
EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable Federal, State, and local
agencies as required in Section
1472.01 , and the activity is in compliance with Chapter 1459 City of Mentor on
the Lake's erosion and sediment control requirements and Chapter 1286 City of
Mentor on the Lake's riparian setback requirements, all as determined by the
City Engineer. At a minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the
project will minimize changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form,
channel form, and habitat of upstream and downstream channels on and off the
property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges.  Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that off-site
runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a manner
that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow.  The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the City Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels.  Unless otherwise allowed by the City Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with vegetated
banks and designed to carry the 10-year, 24-hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems.  Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under City zoning or where the use of an open drainage system affects
public health or safety, all as determined by the City Engineer. The following
criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5-year, 24-hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10-year, 24-hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water resource crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the City:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25-year, 24-hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, 25% of the
cross-sectional area or a minimum of one foot of box culverts and pipe arches
must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or conveyance must to be
sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10-
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of five square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100-year,
24-hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding.  Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation.  In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City must be
compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First consideration for
the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be given to areas
where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new floodplain
within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also be given to
enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for floodplain
fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing watershed. Unless
otherwise permitted by the City, reductions in volume due to floodplain fills
must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the development. Embankment
slopes used in compensatory storage areas must reasonably conform to the
natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The use of vertical retaining
structures is specifically prohibited.
            NOTE: This division (8) should be coordinated with the City’s
riparian setback ordinance. The requirement for compensatory floodplain storage
is only in effect when the riparian setback does not include the entire 100-
year floodplain, when the City grants a variance that allows filling in the
floodplain due to site constraints, or when the City Engineer determines that
stream or floodplain restoration is needed to meet the objectives of this
regulation.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation.  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control:
      (1)   Direct runoff to an SCM:  The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more of the following SCMs. These practices are listed in
Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general
performance standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The City Engineer may require a soil engineering report to be
prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed infiltration facilities
meet these performance standards.
               For sites less than five acres, but required to create a
comprehensive stormwater management plan, the City Engineer may approve other
SCMs if the applicant demonstrates to the City Engineer's satisfaction that
these SCMs meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in division (c)(6)
of this section.
         C.   For sites greater than five acres, or less than five acres but
part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five or
more acres, the City Engineer may approve other SCMs if the applicant
demonstrates to the City Engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs meet the
objectives of this regulation as stated in division (c)(6) of this section, and
has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         D.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the State, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the City Engineer may approve SCMs not included in Table 2 of this
regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the Ohio
Department of Transportation "Location and Design Manual, Volume Two Drainage
Design".
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs.  SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the City Engineer
that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs controlling the
amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-term hourly
records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
                  WQv = C*P*A/12
               where terms have the following meanings:
                  WQv  =   water quality volume in acre-feet
                  C     =   runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than
1 in.
                  P     =   0.75 inch precipitation depth
                  A     =   area draining into the stormwater practice, in
acres.
               Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) for use in determining the WQv can be determined
using the list in Table 1 or using the following equation to calculate the
runoff coefficient
                  C = 0.858i3 -0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:
                  i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
 
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
Land Use Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is low density residential, 30% is
high density residential, and 10% is open space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
 
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the stormwater practice for sediment storage. This volume
shall be incorporated into the sections of stormwater practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   (Intentionally left blank.)
         D.   Stormwater quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
         E.   (Intentionally left blank.)
         F.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site.

1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended setention
basins. Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv.
3 Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQv.
4 Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water. Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7 Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv
in a pool and 75% in marshes. The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal
to the WQv.
 
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
in Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than one third of the drain time. The
outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and
promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than four
feet shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least eight feet
and no more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The eight feet
wide portion of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an
average depth of six inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of
aquatic vegetation. The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15
inches below the permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who
accidentally or intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense
vegetation in a manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through
the vegetation. The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1
(V). The aquatic bench shall be planted with hearty plant species comparable to
wetland vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged inundation.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The forebay and micropool volume shall
be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
            4.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance.
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
Note: The section below identifies the criteria that are currently being used
by the Ohio EPA to assess the equivalency of alternative practices that are not
listed in Table 2.
      (5)   Criteria for the acceptance of alternative post-construction SCMs:
The applicant may request approval from the City Engineer for the use of
alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant shows to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer that these SCMs are equivalent in pollutant
removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those listed in Table
2. If the site is greater than five acres, or less than five acres but part of
a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five or more
acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is necessary. To demonstrate the
equivalency, the applicant must show:
         A.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of eighty percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100% of the
project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5% of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a (TMDL) has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control.  The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the critical storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
critical storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The critical storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the City Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet)
of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development drainage
area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the following
standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   (Intentionally left blank.)
            4.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            5.   Rainfall depth.  For the most accurate, up-to-date, location-
specific rainfall data for stormwater design, use the Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States, NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). [available online: http://
hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/ hdsc/pfds/.]
            6.   Temporal distribution.  Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than one
year. Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            7.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past ten years and not only the current
land use.
            8.   (Intentionally left blank.)
            9.   (Intentionally left blank.)
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems. From
the volume determined in division (d)(3)A. of this section, determine the
percent increase in volume of runoff due to development. Using the percentage,
select the 24-hour critical storm from Table 3.
 
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff
is:                                               The Critical Storm will be:
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:
--- 10  1 year
10  20  2 year
20  50  5 year
50  100 10 year
100 250 25 year
250 500 50 year
500 --- 100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the critical storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
   (e)   Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects.
      (1)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment
projects shall reduce existing site impervious areas by at least 20%.  A one-
for-one credit towards the 20% net reduction of impervious area can be obtained
through the use of green roofs. Where site conditions prevent the reduction of
impervious area, SCMs shall be implemented to treat at least 20% of the WQv.
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and stormwater
quality control facilities are used, ensure a 20% net reduction of the site
impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20% of the WQv, or a
combination of the two.
      (3)   Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume required to be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100% water quality volume and redevelopment at 20%.
      (4)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section
1472.10 may be approved by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 2017-O-05.  Passed 3-14-17.)
   1472.10   ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the City determines that site constraints compromise the intent
of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in an
improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the same hydrologic unit code (HUC) 12 watershed
unit as the proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the
water quality volume at the point of retrofit, whichever is greater.
      (4)   An inspection and maintenance agreement as described in Section
1472.08(d)(10) is established to ensure operations and treatment in perpetuity.
      (5)   Obtain prior written approval from Ohio EPA.
   (b)   Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the following.
All alternative actions shall be approved by the City Engineer:
      (1)   Fees, in an amount specified by the City to be applied to City-wide
SCMs.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site SCMs and/or the retrofit of an existing
practice to increase quality and quantity control.
      (3)   Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
      (4)   Acquisition or conservation easements on protected open space
significantly contributing to stormwater control such as wetland complexes.
(Ord. 2017-O-05.  Passed 3-14-17.)
   1472.11   EASEMENTS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the City Engineer for inspections and
maintenance shall be secured by easements. The following conditions shall apply
to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the City prior to approval of a final
plat and shall be recorded with the County Auditor and on all property deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the City Engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than 25-feet wide.
The easement shall also incorporate the entire practice plus an additional 25-
foot wide band around the perimeter of the SCM.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to structural SCMs shall be restricted against the
construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may
obstruct the free flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and
maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final grade from that
described by the final grading plan approved by the City.  Any re-grading and/
or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be removed by the City
at the property owners' expense.
(Ord. 2017-O-05.  Passed 3-14-17.)
   1472.12   MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the applicant and provided to the
City Engineer:
   (a)   Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent SCMs must be
installed and made functional, as determined by the City Engineer and per the
approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   An as-built certification, including as-built survey and inspection,
must be sealed, signed and dated by a professional engineer and a professional
surveyor with a statement certifying that the stormwater control measures, as
designed and installed, meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Stormwater
Management Plan approved by the City Engineer.  In evaluating this
certification, the City Engineer may require the submission of a new set of
stormwater practice calculations if he/she determines that the design was
altered significantly from the approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan. The as-built survey must provide the location, dimensions, and bearing of
such practices and include the entity responsible for long-term maintenance as
detailed in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement.
   (c)   A copy of the complete and recorded Inspection and Maintenance Plan
and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement as specified in Section
1472.08 must be provided to the City Engineer.
(Ord. 2017-O-05.  Passed 3-14-17.)
   1472.13   ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   The owner shall inspect SCMs regularly as described in the Inspection and
Maintenance Plan and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement. The City has the
authority to enter upon the property to conduct inspections as necessary, with
prior notification of the property owner, to verify that the SCMs are being
maintained and operated in accordance with this regulation. Upon finding a
malfunction or other need for maintenance or repair, the City shall provide
written notification to the responsible party, as detailed in the Inspection
and Maintenance Agreement, of the need for maintenance. Upon notification, the
responsible party shall have five working days, or other mutually agreed upon
time, to makes repairs or submit a plan with detailed action items and
established timelines. Should repairs not be made within this time, or a plan
approved by the City Engineer for these repairs not in place, the City may
undertake the necessary repairs and assess the responsible party.
(Ord. 2017-O-05.  Passed 3-14-17.)
   1472.14   FEES.
   The Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan review, filing, and inspection
fee is part of a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to the City
before the review process begins. The City Engineer shall establish a fee
schedule based upon the actual estimated cost for providing these services.
(Ord. 2017-O-05.  Passed 3-14-17.)
   1472.15   BOND.
   (a)   If a Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond
of 5% of the total project cost has been deposited with the City Finance
Department. This bond shall be posted for the City to perform the obligations
otherwise to be performed by the owner of the development area as stated in
this regulation and to allow all work to be performed as needed in the event
that the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of this regulation. The
stormwater bond will be returned, less City administrative fees as detailed in
this chapter, when the following three criteria are met:
      (1)   After 80% of the lots of the project have been complete or 100% of
the total project has been permanently stabilized or three years from the time
of permanent stabilization have passed.
      (2)   An as-built inspection of all stormwater control measures as
described in Section
1472.12 is approved by the City Engineer.
      (3)   An Inspection and Maintenance Plan has been approved by the City
and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement has been signed by the developer, the
contractor, the City, and the private owner or homeowners association who will
take long term responsibility for these SCMs, is accepted by the City Engineer.
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
the City may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding issues with all
stormwater management structures on the site and the remainder of the bond
shall be given to the private lot owner/homeowners association for the purpose
of long term maintenance of the project.
(Ord. 2017-O-05.  Passed 3-14-17.)
   1472.16   INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY STORMWATER CONTROL MEASURES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the City Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the final
grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the site is
subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods. The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the City Engineer to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized. Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service. Upon completion of installation of these practices, all disturbed
areas and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these practices must
be stabilized within two days.
(Ord. 2017-O-05.  Passed 3-14-17.)
   1472.17   VIOLATIONS.
   No person shall violate or cause or knowingly permit to be violated any of
the provisions of this regulation, or fail to comply with any of such
provisions or with any lawful requirements of any public authority made
pursuant to this regulation, or knowingly use or cause or permit the use of any
lands in violation of this regulation or in violation of any permit granted
under this regulation.
(Ord. 2017-O-05.  Passed 3-14-17.)
   1472.18   APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by any order, requirement, determination, or any other
action or inaction by the City in relation to this regulation may appeal to the
court of common pleas. Such an appeal shall be made in conformity with R.C.
Chapter 2505 and 2506. Written notice of appeal shall be served on the City.
(Ord. 2017-O-05.  Passed 3-14-17.)
   1472.99   PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person, firm, entity or corporation; including but not limited to,
the owner of the property, his agents and assigns, occupant, property manager,
and any contractor or subcontractor who violates or fails to comply with any
provision of this regulation is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree and
shall be fined no more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for no
more than 60 days, or both, for each offense. A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance
occurs or continues.
   (b)   The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the City instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a court of
proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful development, or to restrain,
correct, or abate a violation, or to require compliance with the provisions of
this regulation or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules, or regulations, or
the orders of the City.
