§ 4-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Village of Ardsley
Board of Architectural Review Ordinance."
§ 4-2. Findings of fact.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Ardsley finds that certain
undesirable effects may arise from an extreme design of buildings.
Excessive uniformity of nearby structures and excessive incongruity of a
building in proximity with more typical buildings may adversely affect the
desirability of a neighborhood by reason of comfort, general welfare of
the inhabitants and stability of assessed valuation; and, further, it may so
depreciate the immediate vicinity that a disproportion exists between the
taxes and the costs of municipal services.
§ 4-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote and protect the health, safety,
comfort and general welfare of the community by preventing excessive
uniformity and excessive incongruity of design of buildings in proximity with
more typical buildings, to encourage the most appropriate use of the land,
to promote the public prosperity and to conserve the value of buildings and
property.
§ 4-4. Members; term of office; meetings.
A. The Mayor, with the approval of a majority of the Board of Trustees,
shall appoint five resident voters of the Village of Ardsley, three of
whom shall have degrees or otherwise be qualified by training or
experience in one of the following: architecture, engineering or art. The
remaining two members shall possess attributes which, in the opinion
of the Board of Trustees, qualify them for appointment. In addition to
the foregoing five regular members, the Mayor, with the approval of the
majority of the Board of Trustees, shall appoint two alternate members
of the Board of Architectural Review. These alternate members all serve
in those instances when a regularly appointed member is unable or
incapable of hearing and deliberating on an application. Alternate
members shall possess the same status and rights as all regularly

appointed members, receive notices of all meetings and be required to
attend and participate upon the request of the Chairman. [Amended

B. The original term of office shall be one member for one year, two
members for two years and two members for three years. Subsequent
appointments shall run for three years. Vacancies shall be filed by the
Board of Trustees within 90 days for the duration of the unexpired term.
C. Meetings of the Board of Architectural Review shall be held twice each
month or less if there are no applications before the Board.
D. The Chairman shall be designated by the Mayor and approved by the
Board of Trustees. The Board of Architectural Review shall appoint one
of its members as Secretary.
E. All plans for which a building permit is sought shall be brought before
the Board of Architectural Review for its consideration.
A. The Board of Architectural Review shall render decisions with a
majority vote of not less than three votes. A quorum shall be three
members.
B. The Board of Architectural Review shall keep accurate minutes or
summaries of all its proceedings.
C. (Reserved)2
D. The Board of Architectural Review shall examine all plans submitted to
the Building Department relating to the apparent external structure
and shall approve or disapprove such plans and may make
recommendations to the applicant. Disapproval shall be based upon
excessive uniformity to nearby structures and excessive incongruity
with respect to buildings in proximity, when such characteristics will, in
the opinion of the Board of Architectural Review, adversely affect the
comfort and general welfare of the nearby inhabitants, the stability of
assessed valuation of nearby buildings and cause a disproportion to
exist between taxes and municipal services. [Amended 12-19-1988
by L.L. No. 7-1988]
E. The effect of a Board of Architectural Review approval shall be
permissive upon the Building Inspector insofar as the Board of
Architectural Review is legally constituted and authorized. The effect of
a Board of Architectural Review disapproval shall be to prohibit the
Building Inspector from issuing a permit.
F. Prior to any such decision, the Board of Architectural Review shall
afford reasonable opportunity to the applicant to confer with said Board

officials and employees serving the Village of Ardsley from losses which
have been or may be brought against them, in their individual capacity, for

ARTICLE II
Antennas Requiring Building Permit
§ 50-9. Legislative intent.
The installation of an antenna to receive and/or transmit radio, video and/
or other data transmissions from ground- or satellite-based stations must
be controlled consistent with applicable federal statutes and regulations
promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission so as to protect
the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Village of Ardsley

the Village of Ardsley and its environs. It is the intention of this Article
to regulate all antennas of whatever type without differentiation and to
impose only those restrictions and requirements as are necessary to protect
the public health from improperly installed structures and to preserve and
protect the uncluttered appearance of residential, commercial, business,
marine, manufacturing and other zoning districts of the village. To the
extent that differentiation in regulation of satellite antennas and other types
of antennas may be determined to exist in this Article, the regulation of
satellite antennas shall be interpreted and applied so as not to impose
unreasonable limitations on the reception or transmission of satellite
signals or to impose costs on the satellite antenna user that are excessive in
light of the cost of the antenna.

After the effective date of this Article, it shall be unlawful and a violation of
this Article for any person to erect, construct, relocate, reconstruct, display

§ 50-11 ARDSLEY CODE § 50-13
50:76
A. An antenna, other than a parabolic or dish-type antenna structure, may
be installed in any zoning district and may be roof-mounted or groundmounted.
If roof-mounted, its height, including support structure, but
not including the height of the roof upon which it is to be installed, shall
not exceed 15 feet, and the length of its longest horizontal component
shall not exceed 10 feet. If ground-mounted, the antenna, including any
support structure, shall not exceed 15 feet in height, and the length of
its longest horizontal component shall not exceed 10 feet. Any groundmounted
antenna, other than a parabolic or dish-type, shall be located
in the rear yard, unless it is shown that location in a side yard is
necessary for proper reception or transmission of the signal for which
the antenna is designated. Whether roof-mounted or ground-mounted,
the antenna shall be located so as to minimize the visibility of the
antenna from adjacent properties, provided that this requirement shall
not be implemented so as to interfere with the antenna's ability to
transmit or receive the signal for which it is designed. Suitable
screening may be required for a ground-mounted antenna where
necessary to mitigate the visual or aesthetic impact of the antenna,
provided that the cost is no more than 25% of the cost of the antenna,
and provided that the screening will not unreasonably interfere with
the antenna's ability to receive or transmit the signal for which it was
designed.
B. A parabolic or other dish-type antenna structure may be installed in any
zoning district. No parabolic or dish-type antenna shall have an area,
measured as if the dish of the antenna were two-dimensional, that
exceeds 16.7 square meters or a height that exceeds 13 feet, including
any mast or base structure, but not including the height of the building
upon which it may be located. In one- and two-family residential zoning
districts, the antenna shall be ground-mounted in the rear yard only,
unless it is shown that location in a side yard is necessary for proper
reception or transmission of the signal for which the antenna is
designed. Roof-mounting shall not be permitted unless it is shown that
no rear yard or side yard ground location of the antenna is available
that permits the proper reception or transmission of the signal for
which the antenna was designed. A front yard location for an antenna is
prohibited. In all zoning districts other than one- and two-family
residential districts, the antenna may be ground-mounted in the rear
yard or roof-mounted. In all zoning districts, an antenna shall be
positioned, whether ground-mounted or roof-mounted, so as to limit the
visibility of the antenna from adjacent properties, provided that this
requirement shall not interfere with the antenna's ability to transmit or
receive the signal for which it was designed. Screening may be required
to minimize the visibility of a ground-mounted antenna from adjacent
properties, provided that the cost of any such screening does not
exceed 25% of the cost of the antenna and does not interfere with the
antenna's use.
C. In all residential zoning districts or where the building is used for
residential purposes, no more than one parabolic and one nonparabolic

revoke any building permit. Notice of such revocation and the reason or
reasons therefor, in writing, shall be served by the Building Inspector upon
the person named in the application, by mailing the same to the address
given in the application, and upon the last known owner of the premises on
which the antenna is placed, by mailing the same to his name and address
as shown on the assessment roll of the village, and by filing a copy of said
notice immediately in the office of the Village Clerk.

antenna shall be permitted for each principal building, and the antenna
shall be regulated as an accessory use under the Village Zoning Code,8
and all applicable yard setbacks shall apply.
D. In all zoning districts other than residential zoning districts, and where
the building is not used for residential purposes, no more than two
antennas of any type or size per building shall be permitted.
E. All antennas shall be installed and erected in conformance with
applicable Building Code and Electrical Code regulations9 so as not to
cause a hazard to human health or property from structural
impairment, disassembly or collapse.

the terms of this Article or is unsafe and insecure or has been allowed
to deteriorate in appearance and/or maintenance or is in such condition
as to be a menace to the safety of the public, he shall thereupon
issue or cause to be issued a notice, in writing, to the owner, if the
whereabouts of such owner is known, informing such person of the
violation of this Article or the dangerous condition of such antenna and
directing him to make such alteration or repair thereto or to do such
things or acts as are necessary or advisable to place such structure
in a safe, substantial and secure condition and to make the same
comply with the requirements of this Article within such reasonable
time as shall be stated in such notice. Upon failure to comply with
such notice within the time specified, the Building Inspector may cause
such antenna or such part thereof as is constructed or maintained in
violation of this Article to be removed and may charge the expense of
such removal to the person so notified; provided, however, that nothing
herein contained shall prevent the Building Inspector from adopting
such precautionary measures as may be necessary or advisable in case
of imminent danger to the public or to adjoining property to place such
antenna in a safe condition, the expense of which shall be paid by the
owner.
B. Every person maintaining a permitted antenna shall, upon vacating the
premises where the antenna is maintained, forthwith remove such
antenna.
A. All appeals and all applications for variances from the regulations
herein contained shall be referred to and determined by the Board of
Appeals in accordance with its usual procedures with regard to public
notice and hearing.

newspaper and shall also be mailed to all owners of land within 100 feet
extending in both directions along the frontage of the street from the
point at which the antenna in question is located and, similarly, to the
owners of land whose frontage is directly opposite thereto.
C. The Board of Appeals shall have authority to vary or modify the
regulations contained herein in cases where it is satisfied that unique
circumstances or undue hardship entitle an application to some relief:
provided, however, that such relief will not be detrimental to the district
in which the antenna is located, and the Board may set such conditions
and safeguards as it considers appropriate to that end.
D. In matters of appeal, the Board of Appeals shall have the power to
affirm, reverse or modify the determination appealed from.
E. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to limit the powers of the
Board of Appeals conferred by the Village Law, but shall be deemed to
be in addition thereto.

operations unless he is the holder of a blaster's license in the Village of
Ardsley and unless he obtains a permit for the proposed work from the
Building Inspector. Application for a blaster's license shall be made to
the Building Inspector on forms prescribed by him. Applicants shall be
at least 21 years of age and of good character and habits and shall
satisfy the Building Inspector as to their experience in handling
explosives and ability to use the same without undue risk. Each
application shall be accompanied by a license review fee of $5. Licenses
shall be for a twelve-month term and may be renewed by the Building
Inspector for a period of one year on the payment of a fee of $1 for each
renewal. Licenses may be revoked if, in the opinion of the Building
Inspector, the holder has proved himself incompetent or careless. If so
revoked, no new license shall be issued to the same person for a period
of three months, and then only upon satisfying the Building Inspector of
his fitness for such license.
B. Permits; insurance requirements; inspection fee.
(1) Permits for blasting shall only be issued to persons holding
blaster's licenses or to contractors who have in their employ
persons holding such licenses.
(2) The permit shall state the location for which it is approved, the date
issued, the name of the person authorized to do the blasting and
§ 50-20 BLASTING § 54-2
54:81
such other information as the Building Inspector may deem
necessary.
(3) The permit shall be good only for the one location designated
therein, shall not be transferable and shall expire not later than one
year from the date thereof.
(4) The permit shall not be issued until the applicant shall furnish the
Village of Ardsley with a policy of public personal liability injury
insurance in the amount of $10,0000,000 for each accident, as well
as $10,000,000 for property damage. All such insurance policies
shall name the Village of Ardsley as an additional insured. Should
the Building Inspector determine that the extent of the blasting
operations in any particular case and the danger involved require
liability insurance coverage in greater amounts than above
specified, he shall immediately certify his determination to the
Village Clerk and simultaneously request that the Board of
Trustees fix the policy limits. The Board of Trustees shall meet as
expeditiously as possible for said purpose, and said Board of
Trustees is hereby authorized and empowered to fix the policy
limits in such amount or amounts as the Board shall deem
commensurate with the scope of the blasting operations and the
dangers involved, not exceeding, however, the following amounts:
$20,000,000 for personal injury for each accident and $20,000,000
property damage. Such liability insurance policy shall be approved
as to form and sufficiency by the Attorney for the Village, and, after
such approval, said policy shall be filed with the Village Clerk.
[Amended 3-18-2002 by L.L. No. 1-2002]
(5) Application for such permit shall be accompanied by an inspection
fee of $50.
(6) Application for such permit shall be accompanied by a pre-blast
survey for any property within 500 feet of the blast area, which
blast area shall be defined as the area where the rock will be cut,
satisfactory to the Building Inspector. [Added 3-18-2002 by L.L.
No. 1-2002]
(7) The Building Inspector may include in any blasting permit issued
such additional terms and conditions as the Building Inspector
deems necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare.
[Added 3-18-2002 by L.L. No. 1-2002]
C. Before the issuance of any permit, the applicant must file additionally
with the Village Clerk a surety bond, which shall be in the form
prescribed by the Village Attorney and signed by the applicant as
principal and by a solvent surety company authorized to transact
business within the State of New York as surety thereon and must meet
with the written approval of the Village Attorney as to form and
sufficiency of surety, and which bond shall indemnify all persons and
the Village of Ardsley against any loss, expense, cost or damages of any
§ 54-2 ARDSLEY CODE § 54-2
54:82
§ 54-3. Procedures and standards; penalties for offenses.
kind or nature to persons or property resulting from blasting. The
liability hereby imposed upon the applicant shall be one of absolute
liability for any such loss, expense, cost or damages of any kind or
nature to persons or property resulting from blasting, with or without
trespass, and shall not depend upon any question of negligence upon
his part or upon the part of his agents, servants or employees. The
neglect of anyone to direct the applicant, his agents, servants or
employees to take any particular precaution or to refrain from doing
any particular thing shall not excuse the applicant from the liability
hereby imposed upon him.
D. Should the Building Inspector determine that the extent of the blasting
operations in any particular case and the dangers involved do not
require insurance coverage in greater amounts than $1,000,000 for
personal injury for each accident and $1,000,000 for property damage,
then in such case the sum of the surety bond shall be $1,000,000; but
should the Building Inspector determine that said operations and
dangers involved require insurance coverage in greater amounts and so
reports to the Board of Trustees and requests the Board of Trustees to
fix the policy limits, then in such case the Board of Trustees shall
determine and fix the amount of the surety bond, however, not
exceeding $2,000,000.
E. The applicant shall also satisfy the Building Inspector that any
magazine to be used for the storage of explosives on the work for which
the blasting permit is desired has been duly licensed by the Industrial
Commissioner of the State of New York, as provided in Article 16, § 458,
of the State Labor Law.
A. In addition to the procedures and standards herein set forth, the Village
of Ardsley recognizes and adopts the procedures and standards
recommended by the NFPA as the procedures and standards under
which all blasting in the Village of Ardsley shall be conducted. A
violation of the NFPA procedures and standards shall be in violation of
this chapter. Should any part of this chapter be inconsistent with the
NFPA standards and procedures, the more restrictive of the two shall
control. [Amended 3-18-2002 by L.L. No. 1-2002]
(1) Hours of blasting. It shall be unlawful to blast or carry on any
blasting operations after 3:30 p.m. or before 8:30 a.m., nor shall
any blasting be done on Saturday, Sunday or a public holiday,
except with the approval of the Building Inspector.
(2) Covering blasts. No blasting shall be performed in such a manner
or under such circumstances as to eject debris into the air so as to
constitute a hazard or danger or do harm or damage to persons or
property. Before firing a blast which could cause injury to persons
or damage property from fly rock, the material to be blasted shall
be properly covered or screened by a buffer of sufficient mass and
§ 54-2 BLASTING § 54-3
54:83
strength to prevent, with a margin of safety, the ejection of any
material capable of causing injury or damage.
(3) Firing. It shall be unlawful to explode a blasting charge by means of
time, slow-burning or safety fuses or by any means other than some
form of electrical apparatus. At least three minutes before firing a
blast, the blaster shall give warning thereof by causing a competent
person carrying a red flag to be stationed at a reasonable distance
from the blast at each avenue of approach or point of danger.
(4) Shoring. The blasting of rock contiguous to any structure shall be
so conducted as not to cause damage thereto. To this end, weak
walls or other supports shall be shored up, and rotten or
decomposed rock shall be removed only by use of gads, picks or
crowbars. When blasting in the vicinity of a weak structure is
unavoidable, only light face blasts with short lines of resistance and
charges shall be used.
(5) Tamping. Blasting charges shall be tamped only by means of
wooden tamping rods, and explosives shall be pressed or set into
place by steady even pressure only. All strokes or blows with the
tampering rods are forbidden, and no tamping rod shall be used to
which is frayed or split at the end.
(6) Unexploded charge. Immediately after firing a blast, the blaster
shall cause all debris to be removed and shall thoroughly examine
the rock and the drill holes to ascertain whether there remains any
unexploded charge, and until this is done, no drills shall be set up.
In case a charge shall fail to explode, it must be exploded by drilling
one hole at least 12 inches away, which shall be loaded and fired in
the usual manner, but in no case shall the charge and tamping be
removed from the hole without the special permission of the
Building Inspector. In case a blast shall fail to carry away the entire
drill hole and leaves the lower part intact, no further drilling shall
be done in that hole.
(7) Blaster's helpers. No person shall load holes in blasting operations
except the blaster authorized by the license; provided, however,
that while holes are being actually loaded, drillers and drill helpers
may act as the blaster's helpers under the direct supervision and
responsibility of the licensed blaster.
(8) Capping cartridges. Cartridges, while being capped, shall be
removed from any magazine to a distance of not less than 50 feet
and, after being capped, shall not be returned to a magazine.
Cartridges shall be capped only as required for the work and for
immediate use.
B. Violations. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this
chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined a sum not to exceed
$100 for each violation thereof. In addition to the penalty herein

Any ordinance or part of an ordinance inconsistent with the provisions of
this chapter is hereby repealed.

The invalidity of any section, provision or portion of this chapter shall not
invalidate any other section.

otherwise; a statement of the provisions hereinafter set forth with
respect to the making of a survey and the posting thereof and the

term of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Westchester
County, for an order determining the building or other structure to be a

the Village Counsel, and provided, further, that if the unsafe or
dangerous condition is repaired and secured or the building or
structure taken down and removed and payment made to the Village of
all costs and expenses as hereinafter set forth, all prior to the
presentation of such application to the Supreme Court, the Board of
Trustees may direct the Village Counsel or special counsel to cease
proceedings pursuant to this section.

order, within 10 days after service of a copy of such order in the manner
provided in such order or, in the absence of a provision in such order for
the manner of service thereof, in the manner provided by Subsection D
above for the service of a notice if such person has not appeared upon

COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION (ENERGY) PROGRAM
§ 81-1. Legislative findings; intent and purpose; authority.
A. It is the policy of both the Village of Ardsley and the State of New York
to reduce costs and provide cost certainty for the purpose of economic
development, to promote deeper penetration of energy efficiency and
renewable energy resources such as wind and solar, and wider
deployment of distributed energy resources as well as to examine the
retail energy markets and increase participation of and benefits for
residential and small commercial customers in those markets. Among
the policies and models that may offer benefits in New York is
community choice aggregation (CCA), which allows local governments
to determine the default supplier of electricity and natural gas on
behalf of its residential and small commercial customers.
B. The purpose of this CCA Program is to allow participating local
governments including the Village of Ardsley to procure energy supply
service for their residential and small commercial customers, who will
have the opportunity to opt out of the procurement, while maintaining
transmission and distribution service from the existing distribution
utility. This Chapter establishes a program that will allow the Village of
Ardsley to put out for bid the total amount of natural gas and/or
electricity being purchased by local residential and small commercial
customers. Bundled customers will have the opportunity to have more
control to lower their overall energy costs, to spur clean energy
innovation and investment, to improve customer choice and value, and
to protect the environment; thereby, fulfilling the purposes of this
chapter and fulfilling an important public purpose.
C. The Village of Ardsley is authorized to implement this Community
Choice Aggregation (Energy) Program pursuant to § 10(1)(ii)(a)(12) of
the New York Municipal Home Rule Law; and State of New York Public
Service Commission Case No. 14-M-0564, Petition of Sustainable
Westchester for Expedited Approval for the Implementation of a Pilot
Community Choice Aggregation Program within the County of
Westchester, Order Granting Petition in Part (issued February 26,
2015), as may be amended, including subsequent orders of the Public
Service Commission issued in connection with or related to Case NO.
14-M-0564 (collectively, the order). "Order" shall also mean orders of
the Public Service Commission related to State of New York Public
Service Commission Case No. 14-M-0224, Proceeding on Motion of the
Commission to Enable Community Choice Aggregation Programs
(issued December 15, 2014) to the extent that orders related to Case
No. 14-M-0224 enable actions by the Village of Ardsley not otherwise
permitted pursuant to orders related to Case 14-M-0564: provided,
however, that in the event of any conflict between orders from Case NO.
14-M-0564 and orders from Case No. 14-M-0224, orders from Case No.
14-M-0564 shall govern the CCA Program.

relating to the eligibility of participating ESCOs, the operation by which
ESCOs provide energy services and the terms on which customers may
be enrolled with ESCOs.
A. As permitted by the order, the Village of Ardsley may request from the
distribution utilities aggregated customer information by fuel type and
service classification on a rolling basis.
B. Sustainable Westchester, on behalf of the Village of Ardsley, shall issue
one or more requests for proposals to suppliers to provide energy to
participants and may then award a contract in accordance with the CCA
Program.
C. Sustainable Westchester or the Village of Ardsley, if the Village of
Ardsley so chooses, will then request individual customer data from the
distribution utility in accordance with the CCA Program.

residential and small commercial customers, by letter notice, of the
Village of Ardsley's decision to establish the CCA Program, of the

CCA Program.
B. The letter notice will be sent to each customer at the address provided
by the distribution utility and explain the CCA Program and the
material provisions of the ESCO contract, identify the methods by
which the customer can opt out of the CCA Program, and provide
information on how the customer can access additional information
about the CCA Program.
C. The opt-out period shall be at least 20 days.
D. CCA Program bundled customers, upon enrollment, will receive a
welcome letter that will explain the customers' options for canceling
the enrollment if they believe they were enrolled incorrectly or
otherwise decide to withdraw from the CCA Program in favor of another
supplier. The welcome letter also will explain that residential customers
are entitled to the added protection of the mandated three-day
rescission period as detailed in § 5(B)(3) of the Uniform Business
Practices.

ARTICLE VI
Sprinkler Systems
[Added 10-5-81 by L.L. No. 2-1981]
§ 112-94. Buildings required to have sprinkler systems. [Amended
12-3-1990 by L.L. No. 15-1990; 9-8-1992 by L.L. No. 7-1992]
A. The Board of Trustees of the Village of Ardsley recognizes that during
the past few years the Ardsley Volunteer Fire Department has
experienced an increase in the number of alarms. At the same time the
number of active participating firemen has decreased, leaving the
village vulnerable to fires. With an automatic fire sprinkler system, fires
are extinguished at their inception and alarms are sounded to alert
those in danger. Property damage and the loss of lives is also drastically
reduced. It is the purpose of this section to supplement the mandatory
program of installing a fire sprinkler system in all new construction, in
effect since October 5, 1981.
B. All new buildings which are constructed after the effective date of this
Article shall be required to have approved fire sprinkler systems in
accordance with nationally accepted standards.
C. Day-care centers, as defined by the New York State Department of
Social Services, licensed after the effective date of this section,
regardless of location, shall be required to have approved fire sprinkler
systems in accordance with nationally accepted standards.
D. All buildings and occupancies required by this section to install
approved automatic fire sprinkler systems, must do so, irrespective of
installation in a basement area.
E. No building permit shall be issued for the construction of any building
unless compliance is met by submission of an approved fire sprinkler
system design drawing.
F. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for occupancy or use of any
building required to have an approved fire sprinkler system, unless
such system is installed, inspected, tested and approved.
G. Fire sprinklers shall not be required to be installed in spaces where the
discharge of water would be hazardous. In such places, other approved
fire-extinguishing equipment shall be provided, as approved by the
Zoning Board of Appeals.
H. In addition to meeting the fire sprinkler requirements as herein before
defined, all buildings more than two stories in height, constructed after
the effective date of this section, other than single-family detached
dwellings, shall conform to the following:
(1) All walls enclosing elevator shafts, except the walls with elevator
door openings, shall be constructed to approved masonry
materials.
§ 112-94 FIRE PREVENTION § 112-94
112:189
§ 112-95. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
(2) Walls enclosing all stairwells and vertical shafts shall be
constructed of approved masonry materials.
(3) A standpipe system shall be provided in a manner approved by the
Fire Prevention Bureau. It shall meet all the requirements of NFPA
Standards No. 14. The system shall have internal threaded swivel
fittings composed of two-and-one-half-inch New York Corporation
thread.
I. All fire sprinkler systems other than those in one- and two-family
detached residences shall be inspected, tested and certified annually by
an approved fire sprinkler company.
J. The controlling fire prevention standards for the Village of Ardsley are
on file in the office of the Village Clerk.
K. The only accepted thread is two-and-one-half-inch New York
Corporation.
L. Where practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship may result from
enforcement of the strict letter of any provision of this section,
applications for variances consistent with the spirit of this section may
be made to and acted upon by the Zoning Board of Appeals of the
Village of Ardsley. The Board is empowered to grant a variance when it
has found the application of a strict letter of this section would create a
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship for the applicant and the
omission of an approved sprinkler system for all or part of the building
will not significantly jeopardize human life.
M. In granting any variances, the Zoning Board of Appeals may impose
such conditions as such Board may reasonably determine necessary to
mitigate the consequences of the omission of an approved sprinkler
system from all or part of any building, including the requirement that
alternative forms of fire-extinguishing equipment shall be provided or a
requirement of additional alarms or other devices to ameliorate the
effects of having no sprinkler systems.
N. The provisions of this article shall apply to an entire existing
commercial building or individual leased spaced or use, as if newly
erected, where the square footage of any renovations, alterations,
additions or interior repairs exceed 50% of the entire building, leased
premises or individual use, whichever shall be smaller, or when any
change or partial change in the use of the premises occurs which
requires the issuance of a building permit. [Added 5-18-1998 by L.L.

§ 115-4. ADMINISTRATION
§ 115-4.1. Designation of local administrator.
The Building Inspector is hereby appointed local administrator to
administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying floodplain
development permits in accordance with its provisions.
§ 115-4.2. Purpose of floodplain development permit; fees.
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of protecting its
citizens from increased flood hazards and ensuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 115-3.2, without a valid floodplain development
permit. Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by
the local administrator and may include but not be limited to plans
drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions and
elevations of the area in question, existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials, drainage facilities and the location of the
foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee as listed in Chapter A210 of this
Code. In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the
Village of Ardsley for any additional costs necessary for review,
§ 115-3.5 ARDSLEY CODE § 115-4.2
112:202
§ 115-4.3. Permit application.
The applicant shall provide the following information as appropriate;
additional information may be required on the permit application form:
inspection and approval of this project. The local administrator may
require a deposit into an escrow account to cover these additional
costs.
A. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially improved
structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH or Zone A if base
flood elevation data is available. Upon completion of the lowest floor,
the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
elevation, certified by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor.
B. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any new
or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be floodproofed.
Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the structure, the
permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer or surveyor.
C. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 115-5.2C, Utilities.
D. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing
criteria in § 115-5.4, Nonresidential structures.
E. A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by a
licensed professional engineer must be submitted that demonstrate
that the altered or relocated segment will provide equal or greater
conveyance than the original stream segment. The applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the
documents enumerated in § 115-3.2, when notified by the local
administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the
conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be
maintained.
F. A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required by
the local administrator, which shows whether proposed development to
be located in an area of special flood hazard may result in physical
damage to any other property.
G. In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data is available from other
sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit
applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home and recreational vehicle

following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 115-4.3, Permit application, and for compliance
with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of § 115-5, Construction Standards, and, in
particular, § 115-5.1A, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
§ 115-5, Construction Standards, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.

Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
§ 115-4.3 ARDSLEY CODE § 115-4.4
112:204
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 115-4.3G, as criteria for requiring that
new construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data is not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
(1) Notify adjacent communities and the New York State Department
of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of such
notification to the Regional Director, Region II, Federal Emergency
Management Agency.

elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation in relation to
mean sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by or under the
direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or professional
engineer and certified by the same. For manufactured homes, the
permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation upon
placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of elevation
must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a
site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed
and ready for highway use).
(2) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator or his agent, and/or the developer's
engineer or architect, shall make periodic inspections at appropriate
times throughout the period of construction in order to monitor
compliance with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify,
if requested, that the development is in compliance with the
§ 115-4.4 FIRE PREVENTION § 115-4.4
112:205
requirements of the floodplain development permit and/or any variance
provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue or cause to be issued a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 115-3.5 of this chapter.
(2) The local administrator shall issue or cause to be issued a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found noncompliant
with the provisions of this chapter and/or the conditions of the
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 115-3.5 of this chapter.
G. Certificate of compliance.

enumerated in § 115-3.2, it shall be unlawful to occupy or to permit
the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate
of compliance has been issued by the local administrator stating
that the building or land conforms to the requirements of this
chapter.
(2) A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the local
administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in
areas of special flood hazard.
(3) Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in Subsection E, Inspections, and/or any
certified elevations, hydraulic data, floodproofing, anchoring
requirements or encroachment analyses which may have been
required as a condition of the approved permit.
H. Information to be retained. The local administrator shall retain and
make available for inspection copies of the following:

(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program of that area.
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with

adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of
the Village. These stone walls and pillars constitute a scenic resource, and
it is the purpose of this article to protect this resource.
§ 125-2. Permit/site plan approval required for any work to a stone
wall/pillar.
A. No person shall, without first obtaining site plan approval from the
Planning Board and/or permit from the Building Inspector as herein
provided, either purposely or negligently, remove, destroy, tear down,
or otherwise damage or modify or commit any other affirmative act
which will lead to the eventual modification or repair of the stone walls
and/or pillars in the Village of Ardsley, or any part thereof. This article
shall only apply to the aforementioned stone walls and pillars, to the
extent they exist, located as follows: pillars on both sides of
Revolutionary Road at Saw Mill River Road (9A); pillars on both sides of
Major Appleby's Road at Heatherdell Road; pillar on Chimney Pot Lane
at Heatherdell Road; stone walls on both sides of Heatherdell Road
commencing at Farm Road and terminating at McDowell Park. This
article is not intended to encompass the entire Village. Permits or
approvals issued for any other purpose by the Village shall not be valid
for this purpose.
B. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, any person,
corporation, partnership or similar entity whose plans require the
repair or modification of such stone walls or pillars on the property
shall first apply to the Building Inspector for a permit. The Building
Inspector will review applications and determine whether the proposed
action contemplated by the applicant is a repair or modification of a
stone wall or pillar. If the Building Inspector determines that the
applicant proposes a repair to a stone wall or pillar, then the Building
Inspector, in his sole discretion, shall determine whether or not such
repair is necessary. The Building Inspector may grant or deny such
application on such terms and conditions as it may prescribe and in
accordance with the Village Zoning Code and subdivision regulations of
the Village. If the Building Inspector determines that the proposed
action to such stone walls and/or pillars is a modification of such stone
wall or pillar, then the Building Inspector shall refer the matter to the
Planning Board, who shall review the proposed modification of the
stone wall under the provisions of site development plan approval and
this article.

applicant a permit in accordance with Planning Board Resolution
permitting such action.

following circumstances:
(1) If the stone walls/pillars are weakened by age, storm, fire or other
injury such that they pose a safety hazard to the public or the
person or property owner or threaten to cause disruption of public
services.
(2) If the stone walls/pillars substantially interfere with a permitted
use of the property such that denial of a permit would cause undue
hardship to the landowner as determined by the Planning Board
under the site development plan process.
B. The determination of the Building Inspector of Planning Board shall be
final and shall depend upon considerations of general welfare and the
hardship imposed on the property owner by denial of the permit, except
that it shall be subject to such review as is authorized by § 125-4H.
C. In the event that the Building Inspector determines that the stone walls/
pillars or a part thereof are hazardous to life or property, the Building
Inspector shall have the right to waive all notices as required under this
article and to grant immediate approval for the removal of said stone
walls/pillars or section thereof. In the event that such approval is
granted, the Building Inspector and/or Planning Board, subsequent to
the destruction of said stone walls/pillars, shall have the authority to
require complete compliance with all other provisions of this article as
applicable thereto.
A. Any person desiring a permit or approval hereunder shall apply to the
Building Inspector and follow the procedures as set forth above.
B. All applications for permits hereunder shall be made in writing and
verified under oath upon forms prescribed and approved by the Board
of Trustees. The fee for each application shall be $100, payable upon

detailed plans, including a description of the location and condition of
said stone wall/pillar and the reasons for repairing, removing, or
modifying said stone wall/pillar. In addition, all property owners within

owner of the property for which the permit is sought.
(2) The applicant shall submit an affidavit with his application stating
that a written notice of the application has been given by certified
mail to all affected property owners with respect to the property for
which a permit is sought.
(3) The Building Inspector and/or the Planning Board may not consider
any application for a permit or approval prior to the satisfaction of
the notice requirements of this section.
D. The Building Inspector and/or Planning Board may require additional
information, such as the proposed replacement of design of the street
frontage area where the stone walls/pillars are to be repaired or
modified (e.g., proposals for restoration of the stone walls/pillars or
replacement of the stone walls/pillars with trees, gates or any other
suitable materials).
E. The Building Inspector and/or Planning Board shall, prior to the
issuance of a permit by the Building Inspector or an approval by the
Planning Board, require that a person or firm furnish the Village with a
performance bond as approved by the Village Attorney in an amount
sufficient to cover 90% of the greater of the cost of replacement or
restoration work to be completed in accordance with the plans
accompanying all applications, or the costs in accordance with plans as
required by the Building Inspector and/or the Planning Board. The
remaining 10% of the cost of restoration and replanting (e.g., replant
any and all bushes and/or trees removed as a result of the modification
of the stone wall/pillar) shall be in cash, deposited in a special stone
wall/pillar preservation escrow account. The total amount of the bond
and cash deposit shall reflect all restoration and protection costs and
shall be in accordance with each set of individual circumstances. Upon
the completion of all replacement or restoration work to the satisfaction
of the Building Inspector, the performance bond shall be canceled and
replaced with a maintenance bond to be approved by the Village
Attorney and to run for a term to be fixed by the Building Inspector, but
in no case for a period longer than two years. The ten-percent cash in
escrow shall remain on deposit with the Village until the maintenance
bond is canceled, regardless of whether or not the maintenance bond is
an amount less than the 10% cash.
F. No stone walls/pillars shall be destroyed pursuant to a validly issued
permit for a period of 15 days from the date of the issuance of said
permit.
G. All decisions of the Building Inspector and/or the Planning Board
approving applications pursuant to this article shall be sent by the
applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, within seven days

to all property owners within 250 feet of the area in questions and to
the Environmental Conservation Board.
H. Any person, firm, organization or corporation aggrieved, affected or
interested in the determination or decision of the Building Inspector
shall have the right, within 10 days from receipt of the decision, to
appeal to the Board of Trustees, who shall review the decision. Any
decision or determination of the Building Inspector which is appealed
to the Board of Trustees shall be automatically stayed pending review
by the Board of Trustees. Any person, firm, organization or corporation
aggrieved, affected or interested in the determination or decision of the
Planning Board shall have the same rights as it would under site
development plan approval.
I. The Building Inspector and the Planning Board reserve the right to
refuse permits for stone wall/pillar repair or modification if they feel
that the best interests of the public are not served by the proposed
development. The Building Inspector may further revoke any permit if
the work is not proceeding according to the permit and in an orderly
and diligent manner.
J. Any permit granted by the Building Inspector under this article is valid
for six months.
A. All persons who remove or cause to be removed stone walls, with or
without a permit, shall restore the area by backfilling all holes and by
creating an acceptable grade and covering, subject to approval of the
Building Inspector. In addition, all persons removing or causing a stone
wall/pillar to be removed without a permit shall replace the stone wall/
pillar to the sole satisfaction of the Building Inspector before applying
for a permit to remove said stone wall.
B. The Building Inspector shall require maintenance as necessary or
desirable for the upkeep of any stone walls/pillars, trees, plants,
shrubbery or other structures emplaced to replace the modified stone
wall. Should the permit holder fail to comply with the permit or the site
plan approval pursuant to demand from the Building Inspector or the
Planning Board within the required period of time, the Board of
Trustees shall have the right to declare the maintenance or
performance bond in default and apply the escrow cash deposit and the
proceeds of the bond to perform all required replacement or restoration
work. By accepting a permit, the holder thereby agrees to this
procedure and grants unconditional access to the land for such
restoration purposes. If any work is done by the Village, its agents, or
assigns, the applicant automatically agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Village, its agents, and assigns for any and all claims.

stone wall was removed to the sole satisfaction of the Building
Inspector.

NAMING OF VILLAGE FACILITIES
§ 136-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish criteria for naming Village
of Ardsley parks, fields, buildings or other facilities after, or otherwise
recognizing or memorializing, individuals and organizations.
§ 136-2. Procedure.
§ 136-3. Guidelines for selection of names.
A. Requests or proposals for naming a park, field, building or other facility
shall be submitted to the Village Manager or the Village Clerk in
writing. The request or proposal should set forth the proposed name
and a statement describing how the request meets each of the criteria
set forth in §§ 136-3 and 136-4.
B. The Village Manager or Village Clerk may submit a conforming request
to the Ardsley Parks and Recreation Advisory Board for a
recommendation regarding facilities under their auspices. The Ardsley
Parks and Recreation Commission will consider any such request at a
public meeting, and make a recommendation to accept or reject the
request to the Village Board, which has the ultimate authority for
naming Village parks, fields, buildings and recreation facilities. If a
request is not Parks and Recreation related, the request shall be
submitted directly to the Village Board for review.
C. Inherent in the naming process is the intent of permanent recognition.
Therefore, the process shall be careful and deliberate and, as much as
possible, involve the evaluation criteria listed below.
A. Parks, fields, buildings and other facilities generally may be named:
(1) For location, such as the name of an adjacent street or subdivision.
48.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code; see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I.
§ 132-9 FIRE PREVENTION § 136-3
112:239
§ 136-4. Specific criteria for memorializing or recognizing
individuals or organizations.
(2) For a geological, historical, botanical, horticultural or scientific
feature inherent to the area.
(3) To recognize a person or organization in accordance with the
criteria set forth in § 141-4.
A. No park may be named to memorialize a living person. A twelve-month
waiting period must occur before a deceased person may be considered
for recognition.
B. A park, field, building or other facility may be named to honor an
organization or a deceased person, but only to recognize extraordinary
contribution or service to the Village of Ardsley park system or to the
community. By way of example, a person or organization may qualify for
such recognition where such person or organization:
(1) Was instrumental in the acquisition or development of a park, field,
building or other facility;
(2) Made extraordinary contributions to the enhancement of the
quality of life in the community, or other outstanding
accomplishments by an individual for the good of the community
(length of service to the community should be considered in
connection with this criteria);
(3) Made a significant monetary contribution toward acquisition or
development of a park, building, field or other facility.
C. A living person may be honored:
(1) By installation of a plaque or marker at a field or recreation facility;
or
(2) In extraordinary cases, by the naming of a field or recreation
facility. All designations under this paragraph are subject to the
same naming criteria in set forth § 136-4B.
D. The renaming of parks, fields, building and other facilities is strongly
discouraged. It is recommended that efforts to change a name be
subject to the most critical examination so as not to diminish the
original justification for the name or discount the value of the prior
contributors.
E. Parks, fields, building and other facilities named after individuals
should not be changed unless it is found that the individual's personal
character is or was such that the continued use of their name for a park,
field, building or facility would not be in the best interest of the
community. Parks named by deed restriction cannot be considered for
renaming.

disposal, provide an additional revenue stream to the village and will help
to conserve natural resources. Mandatory recycling of newspapers, glass
and metal containers and corrugated paperboard will remove a significant
tonnage of material from the solid waste stream and divert it to a recyclable
use. It is the purpose of this chapter to institute a program of mandatory
recycling for specific recyclable materials in an attempt to derive maximum
environmental and economic benefit with minimum inconvenience to
residents and property owners.
§ 161-2. Separation and collection.
A. The owners, lessees or occupants of all structures within the village

ARTICLE III
Sewer Rents
[Adopted 3-26-2020 by L.L. No. 2-2020]
§ 165-21. Purpose; authority.
The purpose of this Article is to more equitably distribute the cost of
owning, operating and maintaining the Village of Ardsley sanitary sewer
system by allocating such expenses among all properties in the Village that
use the sewer system. Pursuant to the authority derived from Article 14-
F of the General Municipal Law, the Village of Ardsley hereby creates a
program for establishing and collecting sewer rents as a means of funding
the costs associated with the Village of Ardsley sewer system. Such program
shall consist of annual charges against all properties that use the Village '
s sanitary sewers. The sewer rents as provided for in this Article shall be
segregated into a special purpose fund and applied toward defraying the
cost of operation, maintenance, upkeep, repair, replacement and otherwise
improving the sewer system.
§ 165-22. Sewer rent program.
A. Establishment.
(1) The Village of Ardsley hereby establishes a sewer rent program. All
sewer rent shall be used by the Village for the expense of operation,
maintenance, repairs and improvements to the Village sewer
system. The record owner of all real property using the Village
sewer system, or any part thereof, shall be liable to the Village for
the payment of sewer rent, notwithstanding that said property
owner may charge a fee or seek reimbursement from a lessee,
licensee or other occupant of the real property. The failure to
collect fees or obtain reimbursement shall not be a defense to the
property owner' s absolute obligation. All sewer rents and penalties
shall be a charge against the property for which the property owner
and any successor in interest shall be liable.
(2) The Village Board shall have the authority by resolution to
promulgate rules and procedures, and make revisions thereto, for
the efficient administration and operation of the sewer rent
program. Such rules and procedures shall be made available to the
public as with any record of the Village.
(3) In the event water consumption to a particular property is not
indicative of equivalent usage of the sewer system, the Village may
establish a procedure for consumption evaluation and make
adjustments for good cause shown on a case-by-case basis.
B. Applicability. The system for which the sewer rents are established and
imposed is the entire sewer system within the Village of Ardsley as
defined in § 451 of General Municipal Law as such system does now or
as it may from time to time exist.
§ 165-21 RECYCLING § 165-22
161:279
C. Setting of rates.
(1) The initial sewer rent rate and any later adjustments shall be:
(a) Based upon the consumption of water on the property
connected with and served by the sewer system; and
(b) Established in accordance with § 452 of General Municipal Law
by a resolution of the Village Board of Trustees following a
public hearing on notice.
(2) Once established, the rent rate shall be set forth in the Fee
Schedule maintained by the office of the Village Clerk.
D. Payments. Sewer rents shall be payable on the schedule set by the
Village Board of Trustees pursuant to its authority to promulgate rules
and procedures.
E. Billing. Sewer rent bills shall be issued on the basis set forth by the
Village Board of Trustees pursuant to its authority to promulgate rules
and procedures. The Village is authorized to obtain the services of a
third-party billing company to generate and send out all sewer rent
bills. Such bills shall be sent to the address of the property owner as set
forth on the assessment rolls and at a frequency and in accordance with
a billing period set by the Village Board. Delivery of such bills to the
proper party is not guaranteed. If the property owner does not receive a
bill on or before the fifth day following the end of each billing period,
the property owner will be provided with contact information of the
third-party billing company designated by the Village.
F. Late payment penalties, liens and collection. All bills for sewer rents are
due and payable at the address given on the bill and the time set forth
by the Village Board of Trustees. All amounts due for sewer rents will be
received without penalty during the first month following the billing.
Penalty shall be charged at a rate set forth by the Village Board of
Trustees on all bills that remain unpaid past 30 days from the date of
billing. Such penalties will be added to the bill, in accordance with the
provisions of the Village Law. The third-party billing company shall send
to the Village Treasurer all delinquent accounts which in accordance
with General Municipal Law § 452 the delinquent sewer rents shall
constitute a lien upon the real property served by the sewer system.
The lien shall be prior and superior to every other lien or claim except
the lien of an existing tax, assessment or other lawful charge imposed
by or for the state or a political subdivision or district thereof.
Delinquent accounts, including sewer rents and penalties, shall be
collected in a manner provided in General Municipal Law § 452(4).
G. Sewer rent fund. All revenues derived from sewer rents, including
penalties, shall be credited by the Treasurer to a special fund to be
known as the "Sewer Rent Fund." Monies in such fund shall be used in
accordance with § 53 of the General Municipal Law.
§ 165-22 ARDSLEY CODE § 165-22
161:280
H. Sole exemption. All property of the Village shall be exempt from the
obligation to pay sewer rent.
I. Agreement with water source. The Village has received authorization
from the New York State Public Service Commission (Matter Number/
Case No.: 19-01610) to contract with the water source to utilize its
water consumption data and provide any other services necessary to
administer this article.
J. Severability. Should any section or provisions of this article be adjudged
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or otherwise
invalidated, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the
remainder of this article, and it shall be construed to have been the
legislative intent to enact the local law without such unconstitutional or
invalid parts therein.

has determined the site plan application to be complete, a public
hearing shall be held, with notice as required by law. Where a draft
environmental impact statement (DEIS) has been prepared and
accepted, the public hearing on the DEIS shall be combined with the
site plan hearing. In addition, at least 10 days prior to such public
hearing, excluding the day of mailing and including the day of the
hearing, a notice of such public hearing shall be sent by registered or
certified mail by the applicant to the owners of record of all land, any
portion of which is within 200 feet of any portion of the affected land. A
sworn and notarized certificate or affidavit of compliance with this
subsection, listing the names and addresses of the persons to whom
such notice was so mailed, the date of mailing and setting forth a copy
of the notice mailed, shall be submitted to the Village Clerk at least 10

161:287
purposes, including the acquisition of land. [Amended 9-2-1997 by
L.L. No. 4-1997]
I. Effect of approval. The approval of a site plan by the Board of Trustees
shall authorize the Village Building Inspector to issue all necessary
permits in accordance therewith. Prior to such approval, no
construction permit of any kind shall be issued.
J. Expiration of approval. In the event that the applicant fails to begin
substantial construction, including footings and foundations, within one
year from the date of final approval by the Board of Trustees, said
approval shall be deemed null and void, unless said time period is
extended by the Board of Trustees upon good cause.
K. As-built site plans. Upon completion of construction, two copies of an
as-built site plan shall be submitted to the Building Inspector, which
plan shall show all elements of the site as actually constructed. No
certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the site plan has been
reviewed by the Building Inspector and found to be in compliance with
the approved sited plan.
L. Performance guaranties. As a condition of final approval, the applicant
shall agree to install all site improvements and the Village Board of
Trustees shall require the posting of adequate performance guaranties
to insure the installation of all such improvements. Such performance
guaranties shall be in the amount sufficient to cover the cost of all such
improvements, as estimated by the Planning Board, And shall include
an agreed-upon date for the completion of said improvements and shall
be in a form satisfactory to the Village Attorney. Said performance
guaranties may be in the form of a performance bond which shall be
issued by a bonding or surety company approved by the Village Board
of Trustees and shall include an agreed-upon date for the completion of
said improvements. Said performance guaranties may be for a period of
time to be determined by the Planning Board and may include, without
limitation, continuing performance guaranties to insure the
maintenance and replacement of landscaping features required as a
condition of final approval. The amount of the performance guaranties
shall be reduced by the Planning Board when portions of the required
improvements have been completed. The Board of Trustees may
require substitution of a cash bond for a performance bond in the event
that the value of the work necessary for the completion of any site
improvements (including maintenance and/or replacement of
landscaping features) shall be less than $100,000.
M. Independent consultants. In order to assure that the processing of any
application submitted hereunder progresses in accordance with the
requirements of this section, the Board of Trustees may retain
professional consultants (including architectural, engineering and
environmental consultants) whose reasonable fees and expenses shall

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 171-1. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
§ 171-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing within this
jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in § 171-1 hereof. This
chapter seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives:
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and
other desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby
increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the municipality;
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety;
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
§ 171-1 STORM SEWERS § 171-2
170:301
§ 171-3. Statutory authority.
In accordance with Article 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law of the State
of New York, the Village Board of Trustees of the Village of Ardsley has
the authority to enact local laws and amend local laws for the purpose of
promoting the health, safety or general welfare of the Village of Ardsley and
for the protection and enhancement of its physical environment. The Village
Board of Trustees of the Village of Ardsley may include in any such local
law provisions for the appointment of any municipal officer, employees, or
independent contractor to effectuate, administer and enforce such local law.

B. Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES)
General Permit for Construction Activities GP-0-10-001 or as amended
or revised;
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
D. Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land
development activities which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
E. Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to the
maximum extent practicable;
F. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
practices and to ensure that these management practices are properly
maintained and eliminate threats to public safety;
G. Encourage the use of green infrastructure practices to control
stormwater runoff in order to, among other things, protect natural
areas, reduce impervious cover, and implement runoff reduction
techniques to the maximum extent practicable.

purpose of inspection as specified in § 171-10C.
A. Construction completion guarantee. In order to ensure the full and
faithful completion of all land development activities related to
compliance with all conditions set forth by the Village of Ardsley in its
approval of the stormwater pollution prevention plan, the Village of
Ardsley may require the applicant or developer to provide, prior to
construction, a performance bond, cash escrow, or irrevocable letter of
credit from an appropriate financial or surety institution which
guarantees satisfactory completion of the project and names the Village
of Ardsley as the beneficiary. The security shall be in an amount to be
determined by the Village of Ardsley based on submission of final
design plans, with reference to actual construction and landscaping
costs. The performance guarantee shall remain in force until the surety
is released from liability by the Village of Ardsley, provided that such
period shall not be less than one year from the date of final acceptance
or such other certification that the facility(ies) have been constructed in
accordance with the approved plans and specifications and that a oneyear
inspection has been conducted and the facilities have been found
to be acceptable to the Village of Ardsley. Per annum interest on cash
escrow deposits shall be reinvested in the account until the surety is
released from liability.
B. Maintenance guarantee. Where stormwater management and erosion
and sediment control facilities are to be operated and maintained by the

Roadway Construction
§ 173-11. Requirements of developer.
The developer will be required to do all the excavation required in the
construction of the roadway and its structures and connections, the placing
and compacting of the excavation and excavated materials to form the
approximate subgrade, the refilling of all required surfaces, the trimming
and raking of all finished slopes, all as shown on the plans or as ordered
by the Village Manager or his duly designated representative, and whatever
other incidental work as required or directed by these specifications. He
shall grade the entire length of the roadway ditches and side slopes to the
required lines, grades and contours; shall grade public highway or private
driveway intersections as directed; and shall remove spongy material or any
material which is unsatisfactory from the subgrade to depths as directed by
the Village Manager or his duly designated representative.
§ 173-12. Removal of unsuitable material.
All material unsuitable for use in the further construction of the roadway
shall be removed from the site of the work immediately upon being
excavated. Such material shall include sod or other vegetable matter,
rubbish, quicksand, muck, soft clay, spongy material or any other material
which cannot be readily and suitably compacted.
§ 173-13. Embankments.
Embankments shall be formed of suitable material taken from the
excavation. Where embankments are to be placed on existing pavements or
side hill slopes, the original surface shall be broken up by plowing or other
means before any material is placed thereon. Materials shall be placed
in successive horizontal layers not exceeding eight inches in thickness,
and each layer shall be rolled or compacted as hereinafter provided. The
developer shall prosecute his work in such manner that all deep fills are
made first in order that they may be afforded maximum time for settlement.
Where rock excavation is encountered, the contractor shall arrange to
excavate the same so that it may be placed at the bottom of such fills.
No rock, however, placed in fills shall project closer than six inches to the
bottom of the proposed pavement.
§ 173-14. Additional suitable material.
Wherever insufficient material is obtained from the excavation required
within the limits of the roadway to make the necessary embankments,
the necessary additional suitable material may be obtained from borrow
pits furnished by the contractor and approved by the Village Manager or
his duly designated representative, located beyond the limits of the work.
Borrow pits shall be trimmed and left in a neat and orderly condition upon
completion of the work and shall be seeded.
§ 173-11 STORM SEWERS § 173-15
170:325
§ 173-15. Finished subgrade to be rolled.
The finished subgrade shall be rolled to the satisfaction of the Village
Manager or his duly designated representative with a self-propelled threewheel
roller weighing not less than 10 tons. In places where the character
of the material makes the use of this roller impracticable, a lighter one
may be used if approved by the Village Manager or his duly designated
representative. In fills where it is impracticable to use any kind of roller,
the materials shall be compacted by other means as directed by the Village
Manager or his duly designated representative.
§ 173-16. Subgrade.
The subgrade shall be formed in accordance with the width, lines and
grades as established on the plans and specifications. All soft and spongy
materials shall be removed to a depth ordered by the Village Manager or his
duly designated representative and shall be replaced by suitable material.
All boulders and ledge rock shall be excavated to a depth of at least six
inches below subgrade, and the resulting spaces shall be filled with suitable
material. This process of rolling and filling shall be continued until the
subgrade is thoroughly compacted and of the required contour. After the
subgrade is formed, it shall be protected from damage until the pavement
is placed.
§ 173-17. Shoulders.
Shoulders of approximately the dimensions required by the plans shall
be formed along the edges of the proposed pavement before pavement
is placed. They shall be formed of carefully selected material from the
excavation. Upon completion of the subgrade, the shoulders shall be rolled
with a three-ton roller until compact and of the required contour.
§ 173-18. Cleanup upon completion.
Upon the completion of the work, all side slopes, ditches, shoulders and
other portions of the roadway shall be trimmed to the widths and lines as
established on the plans. All surfaces shall be raked free of all loose stones,
and debris shall be removed from the site of the work. The faces of all rock
cuts shall have a fairly even uniform surface, free from all loose stone or
shattered edges or other conditions that will render them unsafe.
§ 173-19. Maintenance of ditches and waterways.
The developer shall maintain and keep open all required ditches and
waterways and do such pumping and bailing as will keep all portions of the
work free from the accumulation of water.
§ 173-20. Grading of roadbed.
§ 173-15 ARDSLEY CODE § 173-20
170:326
§ 173-21. Construction specifications.
A. The subgrade shall be fine-graded as shown on the approved plans and
shall form a neat trench to the full width as shown on the plans to
receive the six-inch bed of stone.
B. The subgrade shall be furnished to the same crown as required in the
plans, with a minimum to be three inches in any case.
C. All soft spots will be removed and drained, backfilled with earth,
properly tamped and rolled in place to bring the depression to the
required grade.
D. At the discretion of the Village Manager or his duly designated
representative, the grade may be changed in the event of hardship to
the contractor due to rock or other condition.
A. No bituminous work shall be done between November 1 and April 1 or
when the temperature is below 50° F., except with written permission of
Village Manager or his duly designated representative.
B. A compacted depth of six inches of one-and-one-half-inch trap rock shall
be placed in the trench formed above.
C. Compaction shall be by means of a ten-ton roller, to the satisfaction of
the Village Manager or his duly designated representative.
D. The trap rock shall consist of a uniformly graded No. 3 stone, all of
which shall pass through a circular mesh of two-and-three-fourths
aperture and be retained by a one-and-one-half-inch aperture.
E. Upon this prepared foundation, a properly heated bituminous material
in the amount of 1 1/2 gallons per square yard shall be spread over the
entire surface at a pressure of 50 pounds per square inch or greater if
required by the Village Manager or his duly designated representative.
F. The road shall be then thoroughly rolled after which all surplus broken
stone on the surface shall be broomed.
G. A course of approved clean three-eighths-inch screenings shall then be
evenly spread thereon in such quantity as to cover the entire surface. A
seal coat of one-half-gallon-per-square-yard properly heated bituminous
material shall then be applied by pressure distributor to cover the
entire roadside.
H. Two bituminous concrete layers, each one inch in thickness, shall be
applied to the road in the following manner:
(1) Where the road has depressions and irregular areas, they shall be
filled, and a binder course of asphalt concrete mix shall be placed
to bring the road back to the designed grade and crown. Where the
depressions require greater than a two-inch wedge course, the
required thickness shall be built up in two-inch layers which shall
§ 173-20 STORM SEWERS § 173-21
170:327
be rolled between each layer. Upon being brought to a proper

ARTICLE VII
Curb Cuts
[Added 12-1586 by L.L. No. 9-1986]
§ 173-43. Legislative intent.
The village finds it necessary to control the location and number of curb
cuts. Such approval or denial will be based on such considerations as
Planning Board requirements, availability of alternative access points,
traffic hazards and conditions and any other factor affecting the health,
safety or welfare of the public or which might be detrimental to the best
interests of the village.
§ 173-44. Permit; application; approval.
§ 173-45. Requirements.
A. All curb cuts in an existing curb or where a curb could be placed along
the street-front property line shall require a permit. Such permit shall
be issued by the Building Inspector after review and approval by the
Planning Board and Police Department.
B. An application for curb cut approval may be included in an application
for new construction. However, an application for work to be performed
outside a B-1 or B-2 Zone shall not exempt the curb cut from the
necessary review and approval of the Planning Board or Police
Department.
C. All curb cuts on Route 9A must meet the approval of the State
Department of Transportation.
D. The village may require as a condition for granting a curb cut permit
that the applicant construct drainage swales, pipes or other drainage
structures on his property to prevent discharge of storm drainage water
onto the village highway in a manner which may affect the health,
safety or welfare of the public or which might be detrimental to the best
interests of the village. Such drainage works shall meet the approval of
the village, and the deposit of security for restoration required for
issuance of a permit may include a sum of money to assure the village
that such drainage works will be built, along with appropriate fees for
the curb cut.
A. All curb cuts for driveways shall have a curb reveal of 1 1/2 inches.
B. Curb cuts in an existing curb shall not be made by cutting or chipping
so as to reduce the height of the curb section. Existing stone curbs shall
be removed, and the same stones or others of equal material and size
shall be reset to the new reveal, with the contractor making such
excavation as is necessary to accomplish the same. Any stone curb reset
in this manner shall be set in a footing of concrete. Existing concrete

§ 173-46. Fees.
§ 173-47. Penalties for offenses.
Any person, firm or corporation found guilty of violating the provisions of
this article shall be guilty of committing a violation, the fine for which shall
not exceed $250.
curb shall be removed, and a new section poured to provide the
required reveal.
C. Where curbing is disturbed by trenching or for any reason other than
the construction of a curb cut, it shall be restored by the placement of a
curb of the same material and size as adjoins the disturbed area. If the
curb is concrete, it shall be cut back at least three feet from each edge
of the trench or area of disturbance, and replaced by a single poured
section. If these cuts are within three feet of any joint in the curb, the
new curb shall extend to such joint.
D. There shall be a limit of two curb cuts per lot and a maximum width per
curb of 14 feet except in unusual circumstances at the discretion of the
Planning Board.
E. Parking on shoulder areas or paving of shoulder areas to provide a
parking area adjoining the traveled way, or lowering of curbs for the
same purpose, will not be permitted except in unusual circumstances at
the discretion of the Planning Board. A "shoulder area" shall be defined
as that unpaved area that is part of the village right-of-way.
A. The fee for such permit shall be $5 per linear foot.
B. The applicable curb cut fee shall be added to the applicable building
permit fee when a request for an approval for a curb cut is included in
an application for new construction.

ARTICLE IV
General Requirements and Design Standards
§ 175-9. Minimum requirements.
The Planning Board, in considering an application for the subdivision of
land, shall be guided by the following standards for subdivision design,
unless the Planning Board makes a finding that doing so would not be
appropriate for the site.
§ 175-10. General.
A. Character of land. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that
it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or
peril from fire, flood or other menace. Land subject to such hazards
shall not be subdivided or developed for residential purposes nor for
such other uses as may increase danger to health, life or property or
aggravate a flood hazard, but such land may be set aside for uses as
shall not involve such danger nor produce unsatisfactory living
conditions.
B. Preservation of natural features.
(1) Land to be subdivided shall be designed in reasonable conformity
to existing topography in order to minimize grading, cut and fill and
to retain, insofar as possible, the natural contours, to limit
stormwater runoff and to conserve the natural vegetative cover and
soil. No tree, topsoil or excavated material shall be removed from
its natural position except where necessary and incidental to the
improvement of lots and the construction of streets and related
facilities in accordance with the approved plan (see § 185-8 for
specific regulations regarding the removal of trees in subdivisions).
Topsoil shall be restored to a depth of at least six inches and
properly seeded and fertilized in those disturbed areas not
occupied by buildings or structures.
(2) Existing natural features which are of ecological, aesthetic or
scenic value to residential development or to the Village as a whole,
such as wetlands, watercourses, water bodies, rock formations,
large trees, historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be
preserved, insofar as possible, through harmonious design of the
subdivision, and where appropriate, the Planning Board, at its
discretion, may require the inclusion of such features as permanent
reservations.
C. Conformity to Zoning Map. Subdivisions shall conform to the streets
and parks shown on the Zoning Map of the Village.
D. Frontage on improved streets. The area proposed to be subdivided shall
have frontage on and direct access to a street duly placed on the Zoning
Map, and if such street is private, it shall be improved to the
§ 175-9 STORM SEWERS § 175-10
170:365
§ 175-11. Standards for streets, blocks, and sidewalks.
satisfaction of the Planning Board or there shall be a bond held by the
Village to guarantee such improvement.
A. Streets.
(1) Legislative findings and intent. The Board of Trustees of the Village
of Ardsley has determined that the standards set forth by the
American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials (AASHTO), as amended from time to time, is adopted to
promote public safety and traffic safety in subdivisions throughout
the Village.
(2) Standards for street design. Streets shall be designed and
constructed to the current standards set forth in "A Policy on
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets published by AASHTO,"
as amended from time to time.
(3) Design speed. The design speed for all new roads shall exceed the
posted or permitted speed by 10 miles per hour or the equivalent of
the 85th percentile of speed of the existing traffic as determined by
appropriate surveys, whichever is higher.
(4) Street names.
(a) All streets shall be named, and such names shall be subject to
the approval of the Village Board.
(b) Names shall be sufficiently different in sound and in spelling
from other street names in the Village so as not to cause
confusion.
(c) A street which is a continuation of an existing street shall bear
the same name.
B. Blocks.
(1) Block length and width or acreage within bounding roads shall be
such as to accommodate the size of the lot required in the area by
the Zoning Ordinance72 and to provide for convenient access,
circulation control and safety of street traffic.
(2) In blocks over 1,000 feet long, pedestrian crosswalks may be
required in locations deemed necessary by the Planning Board.
Such walkway shall be 10 feet wide and be straight from street to
street.
C. Sidewalks.

§ 175-10 ARDSLEY CODE § 175-11
170:366
§ 175-12. Standards for lots.
(1) At its discretion, the Planning Board may require that sidewalks be
installed along either or both sides of any street in a subdivision,
and in pedestrian easements, where necessary to provide safe
pedestrian passage, particularly in the vicinity of schools, parks,
playgrounds and other public facilities, at school bus loading sites
and along thoroughfares and commercial streets.
(2) All sidewalks in residential subdivisions shall be five feet wide,
unless otherwise specified.
(3) Sidewalks shall be designed and constructed in accordance with
Chapter 173, Streets and Sidewalks, of the Village Code, as well as
AASHTO and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990
requirements.
A. Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulty, for reasons of topography or other conditions,
in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the
Zoning Ordinance73 and the County Health Department regulations.
B. Lot dimensions.
(1) Except as provided elsewhere in these regulations or otherwise
permitted by the Planning Board, lot area and dimensions shall
comply with at least the minimum standards of the Zoning
Ordinance for the district in which they are located. Where lots are
more than double the minimum required area, the Planning Board
at its discretion may require that they be arranged so as to allow
for further subdivision and the opening of future streets where
necessary to serve such potential lots, all in compliance with the
Zoning Ordinance and this chapter. Where, in the opinion of the
Planning Board, lots of larger than minimum size are required for
purposes of proper drainage, water supply, waste disposal or the
preservation of important ecological features, the Planning Board,
at its discretion, may require such oversized lots as a condition of
plat approval.
(2) Side lot lines shall generally be at right angles to street lines (or
radial to curving street lines) unless the Planning Board, at its
discretion, allows a variation from this rule to give a better street or
lot arrangement. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to
allow for erection of buildings observing the minimum front yard
setback from both streets.
(3) Where a proposed subdivision includes an existing residence larger
in size than can appropriately be placed on a lot of the minimum
size permitted in the zoning district, the Planning Board, at its
73.Editor's Note: See Ch. 200, Zoning.
§ 175-11 STORM SEWERS § 175-12
170:367
§ 175-13. Improvements.
discretion, may require that the lot be of such size and relationship
to the proposed street system that the structure will be an
appropriate and harmonious part of the subdivision.
(4) Where extra width has been dedicated for the widening of existing
streets, lots shall begin at such extra width line, and all setbacks
shall be measured from such line.
A. Street improvements. Streets shall be graded and improved with
pavement, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, streetlighting standards, street
signs, street trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm drains, fire
alarm signal devices, fire hydrants and other utilities, except that the
Planning Board may waive, subject to appropriate conditions, such
improvements as it considers are not requisite in the interest of the
public health, safety and welfare. The subdivider shall install
underground service connection to the property line of each lot before
the street is paved. Except where waivers are granted, all such grading
and street improvements shall conform in all respects to this chapter;
Chapter 173, Streets and Sidewalks; and the construction standards
described in § 115-5 of the Village Code.
B. Drainage improvements.
(1) At its discretion, the Planning Board may require the subdivider to
carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that
may exist either previous to or as a result of the subdivision. Such
drainage facilities shall be located in the street right-of-way where
feasible or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate
width and shall be constructed in accordance with Chapter 173,
Streets and Sidewalks, and the construction standards described in
§ 115-5 of the Village Code.
(2) Drainage facilities shall, in each case, be large enough to
accommodate potential runoff from their entire upstream drainage
area, whether inside or outside the subdivision, based on a onehundred-
year storm and assuming conditions of maximum potential
development within the watershed as permitted by the Zoning
Ordinance.74 The applicant shall be responsible for submitting such
computations to the Building Inspector in sufficient detail to make
possible the ready determination of the adequacy of the proposed
drainage installations, and the Building Inspector shall be
responsible for reviewing these and preparing recommendations
for the Planning Board.
(3) The Planning Board, at its discretion, may also require the
subdivider to prepare a study of the effects of the subdivision on
existing downstream drainage facilities. Where such study or the
74.Editor's Note: See Ch. 200, Zoning.
§ 175-12 ARDSLEY CODE § 175-13
170:368
Planning Board after an independent analysis determines that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will
overload an existing downstream drainage facility, the Planning
Board shall notify the owner of such downstream facility of such
potential condition and may withhold approval of the subdivision
until provision has been made for the correction of said potential
condition.
C. Underground utilities. In order to assure greater safety and improved
appearance, all utility lines and related equipment for providing power
and communication services shall be installed underground in the
manner prescribed by the regulations of the utility company having
jurisdiction. Underground utility lines shall be located outside of the
traveled way of the streets but, except in unusual circumstances, within
the street right-of-way. Underground service connections shall be
provided to the property line of each lot before the street is paved and
may pass under the traveled way of the street.
D. Other improvements.
(1) Monuments.
(a) Monuments shall be required wherever deemed necessary by
the Planning Board to enable all property lines to be readily
reproduced on the ground. In general, monuments shall be
located no more than 500 feet apart on street lines, preferably
at street, lot or easement corners or at points of curvature or
tangency on curved streets and spaced to be within sight of
one another along lines entirely within the street right-of-way.
(b) Monuments shall be set vertically in solid ground three inches
above the ground surface with accurate reference to a
permanently identifiable fixed point and shall meet or exceed
the construction requirements specified in the construction
standards described in § 115-5 of the Village Code.
(2) Traffic control and street signs. Traffic control and street signs
shall be provided by the subdivider and placed at all intersections,
within the street right-of-way, and in other locations as required by
the approving authority. In the case of traffic control signs and
street signs, their type and location shall be approved by the
Building Inspector of the Village of Ardsley.
(3) Streetlighting standards. When required by the Planning Board,
streetlighting standards, of a design and location specified in the
construction standards described in § 115-5 of the Village Code,
shall be provided and installed by the subdivider.
(4) Sanitary sewers and sewerage facilities, water mains and water
supply facilities and fire hydrants. Where required by the Planning
Board, the subdivider shall install sanitary sewers and sewerage
facilities and/or water mains and water supply facilities and fire
§ 175-13 STORM SEWERS § 175-13
170:369
§ 175-14. Reservations and easements.
All reservations and easements shall be clearly indicated on the final
subdivision plat, along with appropriate notations indicating the rights
which exist with respect to each such reservation and/or easement. All
easements shall be indicated on the plat
hydrants of the type and in a manner specified in the Construction
Standards described in § 115-5 of the Village Code.
(5) Fire alarm signal devices. Where required by the Planning Board,
the subdivider shall install fire alarm signal devices, including
necessary ducts, cable and other connecting facilities, of a type and
in a manner and location prescribed by the appropriate fire district
or other municipal agency having jurisdiction.
(6) Street trees. The Planning Board, at its discretion, may require the
planting of street trees. Such trees shall be of a hardwood variety
indigenous to the neighborhood and shall be at least five inches
caliper at a height of five feet above ground level. Where they are
required by the Planning Board, such trees shall be planted along
both sides of the street, within the street right-of-way, and spaced
approximately 40 feet on center.
(7) School bus pickup areas. The Planning Board, at its discretion, may
require that the subdivider reserve, clear, grade, pave and
otherwise improve an area of such size and location as will provide
a safe and suitable place for the use of children awaiting school
buses. In general, the size of such area shall not be less than 100
square feet, and no dimensions shall be less than eight feet. Such
area shall be included within the street right-of-way and shall be
maintained by the holder of fee title to the street. The layout and
design shall be subject to Planning Board approval.
A. Cash payment in lieu of park reservation. The Planning Board may
require, as a condition to approval of any such plat, a payment to the
Village of a sum determined by the Planning Board in lieu of park
reservation.
B. Widening or realignment of existing streets. Where the subdivision
borders an existing street and the Zoning Map indicates plans for
realignment or widening of the street that would require reservation of
some land of the subdivision, the Planning Board may, at its discretion,
require that such areas be shown and marked on the plat "Reserved for
Street Realignment (or Widening) Purposes." At its discretion, the
Planning Board may not count land reserved for such purposes in
satisfying yard or area requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.75
C. Utility and drainage easements.
75.Editor's Note: See Ch. 200, Zoning.
§ 175-13 ARDSLEY CODE § 175-14
170:370
(1) Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of utilities or drainage facilities within
street rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20
feet in width for such utilities or drainage shall be provided across
property outside the street lines and with satisfactory access to the
street.
(2) At the Planning Board's discretion, it may require that drainage
easements extend from the street to the watercourse or other
drainage facility and convey to the holder of fee title of the street
the perpetual right to discharge stormwater runoff from the street
and the surrounding area onto and over the affected premises by
means of pipes, culverts or ditches, or a combination thereof,
together with the right to enter said premises for the purpose of
making such installations and doing such maintenance work as the
holder of such fee title may deem necessary to adequately drain the
street and the surrounding area. When a proposed drainage system
will carry water across private land outside the subdivision,
appropriate drainage rights must be secured in a form satisfactory
to the Village Attorney and suitable for recording in the Office of
the County Clerk.
D. Easements for pedestrian access. The Planning Board, where it deems
it necessary, may require, in order to facilitate pedestrian access from
streets to schools, parks, playgrounds or other nearby streets,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width. All
easements shall be indicated on the plat.
E. Slope easements. Where determined appropriate by the Planning
Board, the Planning Board may permit an embankment alongside a
proposed street to extend beyond the normal right-of-way of such
street, provided that a slope easement is granted, conveying to the
holder of fee title of the street the right to enter the premises for the
purpose of maintaining such slope. Where the embankment slope is
located on private land outside the subdivision, such easement shall be
permitted only where the appropriate rights have been secured in a
form satisfactory to the Village Attorney and suitable for recording in
the Office of the County Clerk.
F. Sight easements. At the Planning Board's discretion, it may require
sight easements to be provided across all street corners, outside the
street right-of-way, within the triangular area formed by the nearest
edges of street pavement and a straight line between two points each
75 feet back from the theoretical intersection of the edges of such
pavement prolonged. The easements shall provide that the holder of fee
title to the abutting streets shall have the right to enter the easement
area for the purpose of clearing, pruning or regrading so as to maintain
a clear line of sight in either direction across such triangular area
between an observer's eye 3 1/2 feet above the pavement surface on
one street and an object one foot above the pavement surface on the

§ 175-15. Restrictions by owner; modification of standards by
Planning Board.
other. The initial establishment of clear sight lines within the sight
easement area shall be the responsibility of the subdivider.
A. Self-imposed restrictions. The owner may place restrictions on the
development greater than those required by the Zoning Ordinance.
Such restrictions, if any, shall be indicated on the final plat.
B. Modifications of standards. The Planning Board may waive or modify
the specified requirements in any individual case where, in the Planning
Board's judgment, such waiver or modification is in the public interest
or will avoid the imposition of unnecessary individual hardship.

shown on the final plat. Iron pipes shall not be considered permanent
monuments for the purpose of these regulations.
E. Protection of topsoil. No topsoil shall be removed from the site or used
as spoil. Topsoil moved during the course of construction shall be
redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover to all areas of
the subdivision and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting on the
slopes of less than 12% as shown on the final grading plan and shall be
stabilized by sodding on slopes of 12% or over as shown on the final
grading plan.
F. Inspection of improvements.
(1) All of the above-listed improvements shall be subject to inspection
and approval by the Village Engineer (or other appropriate Village
representative as determined by the Planning Board and named in
the resolution approving the final plat, including any consultants

notified by the developer at least 24 hours prior to the start of
§ 175-17 ARDSLEY CODE § 175-17
170:374
§ 175-18. Completion of improvements or filing of bond.
construction. No underground installation shall be covered until
inspected and approved.
(2) If the Village Engineer or other appropriate Village representative
finds, upon inspection, that any of the required improvements have
not been constructed in accordance with the approved construction
detail sheets, the applicant and the bonding company will be
severally and jointly liable for the costs of completing said
improvements according to specifications.
(3) The Village Engineer or other appropriate Village representative as
determined by the Planning Board and named in the resolution
approving the final plat shall act as an agent of the Planning Board
for the purposes of assuring the satisfactory completion of
improvements required by the Planning Board.
(4) The Village Engineer or other appropriate Village representative
shall determine an amount sufficient to defray costs of inspection,
which sum shall be paid to the Village by the applicant before the
final plat is signed.
A. After adoption of a resolution approving a final subdivision plat and
before the plat is endorsed by the Planning Board, the applicant shall be
required to complete, at his expense and without reimbursement by the
Village or any special district, all street and other improvements as
shown on the approved construction plans or otherwise specified in the
resolution.
B. As an alternative, the applicant may file with the Village Clerk a bond in
an amount fixed by the Planning Board in its resolution as sufficient to
secure to the Village the satisfactory construction, installation and
completion of the required improvements. Such performance guarantee
shall comply with the requirements of Article 7 of Village Law and shall
be satisfactory to the Village Attorney as to form, sufficiency, and
execution. Such performance guarantee shall be issued by a bonding or
surety company approved by the Village Board or by the owner with
security acceptable to the Village Board. The term of such bond shall be
fixed by the Planning Board but in no case for a period longer than
three years. Such term may be extended, however, with the consent and
agreement of all parties. Such bond shall state the period within which
the required improvements must be completed, which period shall be
that specified in the Planning Board resolution. All improvements shall
be completed to the satisfaction of the Planning Board in accordance
with the approved construction plans and the requirements of these
regulations and the construction standards described in § 115-5 of the
Village Code.
C. Failure to complete improvements.
§ 175-17 STORM SEWERS § 175-18
170:375
(1) Where a bond is not filed. If all required improvements are not
completed within the period specified in the Planning Board
resolution of approval, such approval shall be deemed to have
expired, unless, upon request of the applicant, the period has been
extended by resolution of the Planning Board.
(2) Where a bond is filed. If all required improvements are not
completed within the term specified by the Planning Board and set
forth in the filed bond and if no application for the extension of such
period and bond has been made by the applicant and approved by
the Planning Board, the Planning Board may thereupon declare
said bond to be in default and collect the sum remaining payable
thereunder, and upon receipt of the proceeds thereof, the Village
shall install such improvements as are covered by the bond and are
commensurate with the extent of the building development that has
taken place in the subdivision but not exceeding, in cost, the
amount of such proceeds.
D. Modification of bond.
(1) Extension of period specified in bond. The time period specified for
the completion of all required improvements, as set forth in the
bond, may be extended only by resolution of the Planning Board
upon request by the applicant setting forth, in detail, the amount of
work which has been completed, reasons for failure to complete the
remainder of the work within the specified period, the maximum
estimated time required to complete the remainder of the work and
the time period extension which is requested.
(2) Reduction of bond. An applicant may request, in writing, that the
Planning Board authorize a reduction in the amount of the bond.
Such request shall itemize the extent of required improvements
already completed, the estimated cost of improvements remaining
to be completed, and the amount of bond reduction requested. The
Planning Board may, if it determines that sufficient required
improvements have been installed to warrant such action, reduce
the face amount of the bond by an appropriate amount so that the
new amount will cover the cost in full of all required improvements
remaining to be completed, and any security deposited with the
bond may be reduced proportionately.
E. The performance guarantee shall in all cases extend for a period of two
years beyond the date of completion of the required improvements to
assure their satisfactory condition. Any defects in the construction or
faulty equipment shall be repaired or replaced by the applicant without
cost to the Village.
F. Modification of requirements. If, at any time, either before or during the
course of construction of the required improvements, it is determined
by the Planning Board that unforeseen conditions make it necessary to
modify the location or design of any improvements, the Planning Board
§ 175-18 ARDSLEY CODE § 175-18
170:376
§ 175-19. Inspection of improvements.
may modify the terms and conditions of the approval so as to require
such change as may be necessary to comply with the spirit and intent
of the Planning Board's original approval and to conform to accepted
engineering practices. If such modification affects the scope of work
covered by a bond, the Planning Board may require or allow
appropriate modification of such bond.
G. Guarantees by utility companies. As to utilities required by the Planning
Board, the Planning Board may accept assurance for such public utility
company whose facilities are proposed to be installed. Such assurance
shall be in writing, addressed to the Planning Board, stating that such
public utility company will make the installations necessary for the
furnishing of its services within a specified time, in accordance with the
approved construction detail sheets.
A. Inspection required. The Building Inspector, or his designee (including
any consultants hired by the Village and funded by the project escrow
account established pursuant to § 38-1B of the Village Code), shall be
responsible for inspecting required improvements during construction
to ensure their satisfactory completion and, upon such completion, shall
furnish the Planning Board with a statement to that effect. If the
Building Inspector determines that any of the required improvements
have not been constructed in accordance with the approved plan and
other applicable laws and regulations, as well as any other applicable
approvals, the applicant shall be responsible for properly completing
said improvements. Failure of the Building Inspector to carry out
inspections of required improvements during construction shall not in
any way relieve the applicant or the bonding company of its
responsibilities related to the proper construction of such
improvements.
B. Inspection of stages of construction.
(1) To facilitate inspection of required improvements during
construction, the applicant shall notify the Building Inspector, or
his designee, at least three working days before reaching each of
the following stages of construction:
(a) Rough grading completed.
(b) Drainage and other underground facilities installed, but prior
to backfilling.
(c) Before installing curbing.
(d) After gravel base is spread and compacted.
(e) When each paved course is being applied.
(f) After completion of all improvements.
§ 175-18 STORM SEWERS § 175-19
170:377
§ 175-20. Public acceptance of streets and reservations.
(2) The applicant shall not proceed to work on any stage subsequent to
the first stage until the work of the previous stage has been
inspected and approved by the Building Inspector or his designee.
In the case of any other improvements, the Building Inspector; or
his designee, shall inspect the work at such progressive stages as
he shall specify, and he shall certify to the Planning Board that the
work was inspected by him and was in accordance with the
approved plans and specifications.
C. Certificate of construction. At such time as the applicant has completed
construction of all required improvements, he shall furnish to the
Building Inspector three copies of as-built plans and profiles which
show the actual location of all paved streets, culverts, headwalls,
drains, manholes, catch basins, sidewalks, curbs, utility lines and
equipment, monuments, street signs, street trees and all other required
improvements, as constructed, and all other pertinent information,
such as cross sections of the streets at intervals determined by the
Building Inspector, the culvert and drain grades, sewer grades,
sidewalk and curb grades and invert elevations at manholes. Such plans
and profiles shall bear a dated certification by a professional engineer
or licensed surveyor to the effect that the data shown thereon was
accurately determined by field survey. If the location or accuracy of
improvements does not, in the opinion of the Planning Board, fully
comply with the approved construction plans and specifications, the
Planning Board shall have the right to refuse to sign the final plat or
release the bond until such situation is corrected.
D. Inspection fee. To offset the cost incurred by the Village in conducting
inspections, all applicants for approval of submissions involving the
construction of streets and/or other improvements shall be required to
submit an inspection fee, payable to the Village of Ardsley, in an amount
as set by resolution of the Planning Board.
A. The approval by the Planning Board of a final plat shall not be deemed
to constitute or imply the acceptance by the Village of any street, park,
playground or other open space shown on said plat.
B. Offers of dedication. All streets and reservations shall be indicated on
the plat. In accordance with § 7-732 of Village Law, the applicant may
add as part of the plat a notation, if he so desires, to the effect that no
offer of dedication of such streets or reservations, or any of them, is
made to the public. All offers of cession to the public of all streets and
reservations not so marked shall be filed with the Planning Board at the
time of submission of the final application.
C. Petition for dedication. Upon completion of the subdivision and the
road(s), a petition in the form required by the Village shall be filed for
the acceptance of any reservations or easements.
§ 175-19 ARDSLEY CODE § 175-20
170:378
§ 175-21. Waiver of required improvements.
The Planning Board may waive, subject to appropriate conditions, the
provision of any or all such improvements and requirements as, in its
judgment of the special circumstances of a particular plat, are not requisite
in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare or which, in
its judgment, are inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting
facilities adjacent or in proximity to the subdivision.
§ 175-22. Certificates of occupancy for structures on bonded
streets.
A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for a structure within a
subdivision where the improvements are guaranteed by a performance
bond unless it is determined by the Planning Board all of the following
conditions have been complied with:
D. Acceptance by Village. Acceptance of any offer of cession of streets or
reservations shall rest with the Board of Trustees. In the event that the
applicant shall elect not to file the plat in the Office of the County Clerk
within the period prescribed for such filing, then such formal offer of
cession shall be deemed void. The approval by the Planning Board of a
subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute nor imply the
acceptance by the Village of any streets, parks or other areas shown on
said plat, and the Planning Board may require the addition of
appropriate notes to this effect on the plat.
E. Maintenance. In the event that no offer of cession to the public is made
for the streets or reservations shown on the plat, there shall be
submitted with the final application copies of agreements or other
documents providing for the suitable maintenance of such facilities and
a statement of all rights which exist with respect to each of them. The
adequacy of such documents shall be subject to the Planning Board's
approval.
A. Status of street improvements. The improvement of the street or streets
giving access to the structure has progressed to a stage deemed
adequate by the Planning Board to render safe all-weather vehicular
access for both routine and emergency purposes.
B. Maintenance agreements. Written agreements have been filed
providing for the maintenance of the bonded street or streets in such
all-weather passable condition, including snow removal and sanding,
during the period between the issuance of the certificate of occupancy
and the acceptance of the fully completed street by the Planning Board.
(If the street is not to be offered for dedication to the Village, such an

Utility Tax
[Adopted 12-27-1967 by L.L. No. 3-1967]
§ 180-1. Authority.
Pursuant to the authority granted by § 6-640 of the Village Law of the
State of New York,78 a tax equal to 1% of its gross income from and after
the first day of January 1968 is hereby imposed upon every utility doing
business in the Village of Ardsley which is subject to the supervision of the
State Department of Public Service, which has a gross income for the 12
months ending May 31 in excess of $500, except motor carriers or brokers
subject to such supervision under Article 3-B of the Public Service Law,
and a tax equal to 1% of its gross operating income from and after the
first day of January 1968 is hereby imposed upon every other utility doing
business in the Village of Ardsley which has a gross operating income for
the 12 months ending May 31 in excess of $500, which taxes shall have
application only within the territorial limits of the Village of Ardsley, and
shall be in addition to any and all other taxes and fees imposed by any
other provision of law. Such taxes shall not be imposed on any transaction
originating or consummated outside of the territorial limits of the Village
of Ardsley, notwithstanding that some act be necessarily performed with
respect to such transaction within such limits.
§ 180-2. Definitions.
As used in this Article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
GROSS INCOME  Includes receipts received in or by reason of any sale,
conditional or otherwise (except sales hereinafter referred to with respect
to which it is provided that profits from the sale shall be included in gross
income), made or service rendered for ultimate consumption or use by the
purchaser in the Village of Ardsley, including cash, credits and property of
any kind or nature (whether or not such sale is made or such service is
rendered for profit), without any deduction on account of the cost of the
property sold, the cost of the materials used, labor or other services or
other costs, interest or discount paid, or any other expense whatsoever;
also profits from the sale of securities; also profits from the sale of real
property growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property;
also profit from the sale of personal property (other than property of a
kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer
if on hand at the close of the period for which a return is made); also
receipts from interest, dividends and royalties, derived from sources within
the Village of Ardsley other than such as are received from a corporation a
majority of whose voting stock is owned by the taxpaying utility, without any
deduction therefrom for any expenses whatsoever incurred in connection
with the receipt thereof; and also profits from any transaction (except sales
78.Editor's Note: See Village Law § 5-530.
§ 180-1 SWIMMING POOLS § 180-2
178:385
for resale and rentals) within the Village of Ardsley whatsoever; provided,
however, that the words "gross income" shall include, in the case of a utility
engaged in selling telephony or telephone service, only receipts from local
exchange service wholly consummated with the Village of Ardsley, and in
the case of a utility engaged in selling telegraphy or telegraph service,
only receipts from transactions wholly consummated within the Village of
Ardsley.
GROSS OPERATING INCOME  Include receipts received in or by reason
of any sale, conditional or otherwise, made for ultimate consumption or use
by the purchaser of gas, electricity, steam, water, refrigeration, telephony or
telegraphy, or in or by reason of the furnishing for such consumption or use
of gas, electric, steam, water, refrigerator, telephone or telegraph service
in the Village of Ardsley, including cash, credits and property of any kind
or nature, without any deduction therefrom on account of the cost of the
property sold, the cost of materials used, labor, or service or other costs,
interest or discount paid or any other expenses whatsoever.
PERSON  Persons, corporations, companies, associations, joint-stock
associations, copartnerships, estates, assignees of rents, any person acting
in a fiduciary capacity or any other entity, and persons, their assignees,
lessees, trustees or receivers, appointed by any court whatsoever, or by any
other means, except the state, municipalities, political and civil subdivisions
of the state or municipality, and public districts.
UTILITY  Includes every person subject to the supervision of the State
Department of Public Service, except persons engaged in the business
of operating or leasing sleeping and parlor railroad cars or of operating
railroads other than street surface, rapid transit, subway and elevated
railroads, and also includes every person (whether or not such person
is subject to such supervision) who sells gas, electricity, steam, water,
refrigeration, telephony or telegraphy delivered through mains, pipes or
wires, or furnishes gas, electric, steam, water, refrigerator, telephone or
telegraph service, by means of mains, pipes or wires, regardless of whether
such activities are the main business of such person or are only incidental
thereto, or of whether use is made of the public streets.
§ 180-3. Records to be kept.
Every utility subject to tax under this Article shall keep such records of
its business and in such form as the Village Treasurer may require, and
such records shall be preserved for a period of three years, except that the
Village Treasurer may consent to their destruction within that period or may
require that they be kept longer.
§ 180-4. Tax returns to be filed; dates.
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file, on or before September
25, December 25, March 25 and June 25, a return for the three calendar
months preceding each such return date, including any period for which
the tax imposed hereby or by any amendment hereof is effective, each of
§ 180-2 ARDSLEY CODE § 180-4
178:386
which returns shall state the gross income or gross operating income for the
period covered by each such return. Returns shall be filed with the Village
Treasurer on a form to be furnished by him for such purpose and shall
contain such other data, information or matter as the Village Treasurer may
require to be included therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this section, any utility whose average gross income or average gross
operating income, as the case may be, for the aforesaid three-month periods
is less than $1,500 may file a return annually on June 25 for the 12
preceding calendar months, and the Village Treasurer may require any
utility to file an annual return, which shall contain any data specified by it,
regardless of whether the utility is subject to tax under this section. Every
return shall have annexed thereto a certification by the head of the utility
making the same, or of the owner or of a copartner thereof, or of a principal
officer of the corporation, if such business be conducted by a corporation,
to the effect that the statements contained therein are true.
§ 180-5. Imposition of tax.
At the time of filing a return as required by this Article, each utility shall
pay to the Village Treasurer the tax imposed by this Article for the period
covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which
the return is required to be filed.
§ 180-6. Insufficiency of return; hearing.
In case any return filed pursuant to this Article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Village Treasurer, and if a corrected or sufficient
return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice from
him, or if no return is made for any period, the Village Treasurer shall
determine the amount of tax due from such information as he is able to
obtain and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of external
indices or otherwise. He shall give notice of such determination to the
person liable for such tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably
fix such tax, unless the person against whom it is assessed shall, within 30
days after the giving of notice of such determination, apply to the Village
Treasurer for a hearing, or unless the Village Treasurer, of his own motion,
shall reduce the same. After such hearing, the Village Treasurer shall give
notice of his decision to the person liable for the tax. Such decision may be
reviewed by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Act of the
State of New York if application therefor is made within 90 days after the
giving of notice of such decision. The proceeding may not be commenced
unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties thereon,
if any, shall be first deposited with the Village Treasurer and an undertaking
filed with him, in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the
Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that, if such proceeding be
dismissed or the tax confirmed, the applicant will pay all costs and charges
which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding, or, at the option
of the applicant, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the
tax, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which event the applicant
§ 180-4 SWIMMING POOLS § 180-6
178:387
shall not be required to pay such tax and penalties as a condition precedent
to the commencement of the proceeding of such order. Except in the case
of a willfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no
assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than
three years from the date of the filing of a return; provided, however, that
where no return had been filed as required by this Article, the tax may be
assessed at any time.
§ 180-7. Procedures for giving notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this Article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this Article or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time, which is determined according to the
provisions of this Article by the giving of notice, shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 180-8. Penalties for offenses.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return, or to pay any tax
or any portion thereof, within the time required by this Article, shall be
subject to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax
for each month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after
such return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the Village
Treasurer for cause shown may extend the time for filing any return, and if
satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the
penalty fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 180-9. Refunds.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof
shall make application for a refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or
the Court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof
was erroneously or illegally collected, the Village Treasurer shall refund the
amount so determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund
may be so made on the initiative of the Village Treasurer. However, no
refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of
the Village Treasurer as hereinbefore provided unless the Village Treasurer,
after a hearing as hereinbefore provided, or on his own motion, shall have
reduced the tax or penalty or it shall have been established in a proceeding
under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Act of the State of New York that
such determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made out
of moneys collected under this Article. An application for a refund, made
as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for the revision
of any tax or penalty complained of and the Village Treasurer may receive
additional evidence with respect thereto. After making his determination,
the Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and
§ 180-6 ARDSLEY CODE § 180-9
178:388
he shall be entitled to commence a proceeding to review said determination
under said Article 78, subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained
relative to the commencement of such a proceeding.
§ 180-10. Tax to be part of operating expense.
The tax imposed by this Article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 180-11. Failure to pay tax; lien on property.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
Article, the Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the Village Treasurer,
bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any
judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Village Treasurer.
Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person
liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the
tax and penalty imposed by § 186 of the Tax Law of the State of New York is
made a lien.
§ 180-12. Administration by Treasurer.
In the administration of this Article, the Village Treasurer shall have power
to make such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law,
as may be necessary for the exercise of his powers and the performance of
his duties, and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other records
relating to the administration and enforcement of the tax, to take testimony
and proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter within the line of his
official duty under this Article, and to subpoena and require the attendance
of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents.
§ 180-13. Return to be confidential.
Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided
by law, it shall be unlawful for the Village Treasurer or any agent, clerk
or employee of the Village of Ardsley to divulge or make known in any
manner the amount of gross income or gross operating income, or any
particulars set forth or disclosed in any return under this article. The officer
charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required to produce
any of them as evidence or anything contained in them in any action or
proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the Village of Ardsley in an
action or proceeding under the provisions of this article or on behalf of the
State Tax Commission in an action or proceeding under the provisions of
the Tax Law of the State of New York, or on behalf of any party to any
action or proceeding under the provisions of this article when the returns
or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding,
in either of which events the Court may require the production of, and may
admit in evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby,
§ 180-9 SWIMMING POOLS § 180-13
178:389
as are pertinent to the action or proceeding, and no more. Nothing herein
shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person or his authorized
representative of a copy of any return filed by him nor to prohibit the
publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of
particular returns and the items thereof, or the publication of delinquent
lists showing the names of persons who have failed to pay their taxes at
the time and in the manner provided for by this article, together with any
relevant information which in the opinion of the Village Treasurer may
assist in the collection of such delinquent taxes; or the inspection by the
Village Attorney or other legal representatives of the Village of Ardsley of
the return of any person who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax
based thereon, or against whom an action has been instituted in accordance
with the provisions of this article. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
article, the Village Treasurer may exchange with the chief fiscal officer of
any city or any other Village in the State of New York information contained
in returns filed under this article, provided that such city or other Village
grants similar privileges to the Village of Ardsley, and provided that such
information is to be used for tax purposes only, and the Village Treasurer
shall, upon request, furnish the State Tax Commission with any information
contained in such returns.
§ 180-14. Disposition of taxes and penalties collected.
All taxes and penalties received by the Village Treasurer under this article
shall be paid into the treasury of the Village and shall be credited and
deposited in the general fund of the Village.
§ 180-15. Limitation on remedies.
The remedy provided by this article for review of a decision of the Village
Treasurer shall be the exclusive remedy available to any taxpayer to
judicially determine the liability of such taxpayer for taxes under this
article.

No exemptions shall be granted pursuant to this article:
A. If the income of the owner or the combined income of the owners of the
property for the income tax year immediately preceding the date of
making application for exemption exceeds the sum of $26,899;
provided, however, that "income tax year" shall mean the twelve-month
§ 180-16 SWIMMING POOLS § 180-17
178:391
period for which the owner or owners filed a federal personal income
tax return or, if no such return is filed, the calendar year; that where
title is vested in either the husband or the wife, their combined income
may not exceed such sum, except that where the husband or wife,
or ex-husband or ex-wife, is absent from the property as provided in
Subsection D(2) of this section, then only the income of the spouse or
the exspouse residing on the property shall be considered and may not
exceed such sum; and that such income shall include social security and
retirement benefits, interest, dividends, total gain from the sale or the
exchange of a capital asset which may be offset by a loss from the sale
or exchange of a capital asset in the same tax year, net rental income,
salary or earnings and net income from self-employment, but shall not
include a return of capital, gifts, inheritance or moneys earned through
employment in the Federal Foster Grandparent Program, and any such
income shall be offset by all medical and prescription drug expenses
actually paid which were not reimbursed or paid for by insurance
compensation. In computing net rental income and net income from
self-employment, no depreciation deduction shall be allowed for the
exhaustion, wear and tear of real or personal property held for the
production of income.
B. Unless the owner shall have held an exemption under this section for
his previous residence or unless the title of the property shall have been
vested in the owner or one of the owners of the property for at least 12
consecutive months prior to the date of making application for
exemption; provided, however, that in the event of the death of either
the husband or wife in whose name title of the property shall have been
vested at the time of death and then becomes vested solely in the
survivor by virtue of devise by or decent from the deceased husband or
wife, the time of ownership of the property by the deceased husband or
wife shall be deemed also a time of ownership by the survivor, and such
ownership shall be deemed continuous for the purposes of computing
such period of 12 consecutive months; and provided, further, that in the
event of a transfer by either the husband or wife to the other spouse of
all or part of the title to the property, the time of ownership of the

such corporation resides and which is represented by his share or shares
of stock in such corporation as determined by its or their proportional
relationship to the total outstanding stock of the corporation, including that
owned by the corporation, shall be deemed to be vested in such tenantstockholder.
That portion of the assessment of such real property owned by
a cooperative apartment corporation determined by the relationship of such
transfer title to the property which as of the date of transfer was
exempt from taxation under the provisions of this article, the
reacquisition of title by such owner or owners within nine months of
the date of transfer shall be deemed to satisfy the requirement of this
subsection that title of the property shall have been vested in the owner
or one of the owners for such period of 12 consecutive months; and

virtue of devise or decent from the deceased owner or owners, or by
transfer by any other means within nine months after such death, solely
in a person or persons who, at the time of such death, maintained such
property as a primary residence, the requirement of this subsection
that the title of the property shall have been vested in the owner or one
of the owners for such period of 12 consecutive months shall be deemed
satisfied.
C. Unless the property is used exclusively for residential purposes;
provided, however, that in the event that any portion of such property is
not so used exclusively for residential purposes, but is used for other
purposes, such portion shall be subject to taxation, and the remaining
portion only shall be entitled to the exemption provided by this article.
D. Unless the real property is the legal residence of and is occupied in

the facility, and provided, further, that during such confinement such
property is not occupied by other than the spouse or co-owner of such
property; or (2) the real property is owned by a husband and/or wife, or
an ex-husband and/or an ex-wife, and either is absent from the
residence due to divorce, legal separation or abandonment and all other

real property; the reduction in real property taxes realized thereby shall be
credited by the cooperative apartment corporation against the amount of
such tax otherwise payable by or chargeable to such tenant-stockholder.
§ 180-18. Application. [Amended 10-1-1990 by L.L. No. 12-1990;
12-21-1992 by L.L. No. 11-1992]
A. Application for such exemption must be made by the owner or all of the
owners of the property on forms prescribed by the State Board to be
furnished by the Ardsley Village Board of Tax Assessors and shall
furnish the information and be executed in the manner required or
prescribed in such forms and shall be filed in such Assessor's office on
or before the appropriate taxable status date. Notwithstanding any
other provision of law, any person otherwise qualifying under this
article shall not be denied the exemption under this article if he
becomes 65 years of age after the appropriate taxable status date and
on or before December 31 of the same year. [Amended 12-2-1996 by
L.L. No. 8-1996]
B. Notwithstanding Subdivision 5 of § 467 of the Real Property Tax Law, an
application for such exemption may be filed with the Assessor after the
appropriate taxable status date, but not later than the last date on
which a petition with respect to complaints of assessments may be filed,
where failure to file a timely application results from death of the
applicant's spouse, child, parent, brother or sister; or an illness of the
applicant or of the applicant's spouse, child, parent, brother or sister
which actually prevents the applicant from filing on a timely basis, as
certified by a licensed physician. In such case, the Assessor shall
approve or deny such application as if it had been filed on or before the
taxable status date.
C. The Village Board of Tax Assessors is hereby authorized to accept
applications for renewal of exemptions granted under this article after
the taxable status date. In the event that the owner or all of the owners
of property which have received an exemption pursuant to this article
on the preceding assessment roll shall fail to file an application for
renewal on or before the taxable status date, such owner or owners may
file the application, executed as if such application had been filed on or
before the taxable status date, with the Village Board of Tax Assessors
on or before the date for the hearing of complaints.
D. Where a person who meets the requirement for an exemption pursuant
to this article purchases property after the levy of taxes, such person
may file an application for exemption to the Ardsley Village Assessor
within 30 days of the transfer of title to such person. The Assessor shall
make a determination of whether the person would have qualified for
§ 180-17.1 ARDSLEY CODE § 180-18
178:394
exempt status on the tax roll on which the taxes were levied had title to
the parcel been in the name of the applicant on the taxable status date
applicable to the tax roll. The application shall be on a form prescribed
by the State Board. The Assessor, no later than 30 days after receipt
of such application, shall notify both the applicant and the Board of
Assessment Review, by first class mail, of the exempt amount, if any,
and the right of the owner to a review of the exempt amount upon
the filing of a written complaint. Such complaint shall be on a form
prescribed by the State Board and shall be filed with the Board of
Assessment Review within 20 days of the mailing of this notice. If no
complaint is received, the Board of Assessment Review shall so notify
the Assessor, and the exempt amount determined by the Assessor shall
be final. If the applicant files a complaint, the Board of Assessment
Review shall schedule a time and a place for the hearing with respect
thereto no later than 30 days after the mailing of the notice by the
Assessor. The Board of Assessment Review shall meet and determine
the exempt amount and shall immediately notify the Assessor and the
applicant, by first class mail, of its determination. The amount of the
exemption determined pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to
review as provided in Article 7 of the Real Property Tax Law. Such a
proceeding shall be commenced within 30 days of the mailing of the
notice of the Board of Assessment Review to the new owner as provided
in this subsection. Upon receipt of a determination of exempt amount
as provided in this subsection, the Assessor shall determine the pro
rata exemption to be credited toward such property by multiplying the
tax rate for the Village of Ardsley on the appropriate tax roll used
for the fiscal year or years during which the transfer occurred times
the exempt amount, as determined pursuant to this subsection, times
the fraction of each fiscal year or years remaining subsequent to the
transfer of title. The Assessor shall immediately transmit a statement
of the pro rata exemption to the applicant. The Village of Ardsley shall
include an appropriation in its budget for the next fiscal year equal to
the aggregate amount of such credits to be applied in that fiscal year.
Where a parcel, the owner of which is entitled to a pro rata exemption
credit, is subject to taxation in said next fiscal year, the receiver or
collector shall apply the credit to reduce the amount of taxes owed for
the parcel in such fiscal year. Pro rata exemption credits in excess of
the amount of taxes, if any, owed for the parcel shall be paid by the
Treasurer of the Village of Ardsley to all owners of property entitled to
such credits within 30 days of the expiration of the warrant to collect
taxes in said next fiscal year. [Added 12-2-1996 by L.L. No. 8-1996]
E. Where a person who meets the requirements for an exemption pursuant
to this article purchases property after the taxable status date but prior
to the levy of taxes, such person may file an application for an
exemption to the Assessor within 30 days of the transfer of title to such
person. The Assessor shall make a determination within 30 days after
receipt of such application of whether the applicant would qualify for an
exemption pursuant to this article on the assessment roll if title had
been in the name of the applicant on the taxable status date applicable
§ 180-18 SWIMMING POOLS § 180-18
178:395
to such assessment roll. The application shall be made on a form
prescribed by the State Board. If the Assessor's determination is made
prior to the filing of the tentative assessment roll, the Assessor shall
enter the exempt amount, if any, on the tentative assessment roll and,
within 10 days after filing such roll, notify the applicant of the approval
or denial of such exemption, the exempt amount, if any, and the
applicant's right to review by the Board of Assessment Review. If the
Assessor's determination is made after the filing of the tentative
assessment roll, the Assessor shall petition the Board of Assessment
Review to correct the tentative or final assessment roll in the manner
provided in Title 3 of Article 5 of the Real Property Tax Law, with
respect to the unlawful entries, in the case of wholly exempt parcels,
and with respect to clerical errors, in the case of partially exempt
parcels, if the Assessor determines that an exemption should be
granted and, within 10 days of petitioning the Board of Assessment
Review, notify the applicant of the approval or denial of such exemption,
the amount of such exemption, if any, and the applicant's right to
administrative or judicial review of such determination pursuant to
Article 5 or 7 of the Real Property Tax Law, respectively. [Added

assessment roll, the Assessor shall petition the Board of Assessment

No. 8-1996]
G. If, for any reason, the pro rata tax credit as provided in Subsection D of
this section is not extended against the tax roll immediately succeeding
the fiscal year during which the transfer occurred, the Assessor shall
immediately notify the Village of Ardsley of the amount of pro rata
exemption credits for the year in which such transfer occurred. [Added
12-2-1996 by L.L. No. 8-1996]
H. If, for any reason, a determination to exempt property from taxation as
provided in Subsection E of this section is not entered on the tax roll for
the year immediately succeeding the fiscal year during which the
transfer occurred, the Assessor shall determine the pro rata tax
exemption credit for such tax roll by multiplying the tax rate for the
Village of Ardsley by the exempt amount and shall immediately notify
the Village of Ardsley of the pro rata exemption credits for such tax roll.
The Village of Ardsley shall add such pro rata exemption credits for
such property to any outstanding pro rata exemption amounts. [Added

shall, upon the receipt and filing of the application, send by mail
notification of receipt to any applicant who has included two such
envelopes with the application. Where an applicant is entitled to a
notice of denial pursuant to this subsection, such notice shall be on a
form prescribed by the State Board and shall state the reasons for such
denial and shall further state that the applicant may have such
determination reviewed in the manner provided by law. Failure to mail
any such application form or notices or the failure of such person to
receive any of the same shall not prevent the levy, collection and
enforcement of the payment of the taxes on the property owned by such
person.
B. Any person who has been granted exemption pursuant to this article on
five consecutive completed assessment rolls, including any years when
the exemption was granted to a property owned by a husband and/or
wife while both resided in such property, shall not be subject to
application requirements set forth in this article. However, said person
shall be mailed an application form and a notice informing him of his
rights. Such exemption shall be automatically granted on each
subsequent assessment roll; provided, however, that when tax payment
is made by such person a sworn affidavit must be included with such
payment and which shall state that such persons continue to be eligible
for such exemption. Such affidavit shall be on a form prescribed by the
State Board. If such affidavit is not included with the tax payment, the

§ 180-50 SWIMMING POOLS § 180-52
178:411
§ 180-52. Exempt organizations.

of the Village of Ardsley.
§ 180-54. Registration; certificate of authority to collect.
§ 180-55. Administration and collection.
A. The State of New York or any public corporation, including a public

activities of which is carrying propaganda, or otherwise attempting to
influence legislation; provided, however, that nothing in this subsection
shall include an organization operated for the primary purpose of
carrying on a trade or business for profit, whether or not all of its profits
are payable to one or more organizations described in this subsection.
A. Within 10 days after the effective date of this article or, in the case of
operators commencing business after such effective date, within three
days after such commencement or opening, every operator shall file
with the Treasurer a certificate of registration on a form prescribed by
the Treasurer.
B. The Treasurer shall, within five days after such registration, issue
without charge to each operator a certificate of authority empowering
such operator to collect the tax from the occupant and a duplicate
thereof for each additional hotel of such operator. Each certificate or
duplicate shall state the hotel to which it is applicable. Such certificate
of authority shall be prominently displayed by the operator in such
manner that it may be seen and come to the notice of all occupants and
persons seeking occupancy. Such certificate shall be nonassignable and
nontransferable and shall be surrendered immediately to the Treasurer
upon the cessation of business at the hotel named or upon its sale or
transfer.
A. The tax imposed by this article shall be administered and collected by
the Treasurer or such other Village employee as he/she may designate
§ 180-52 ARDSLEY CODE § 180-55
178:412
by such means and in such manner as are other taxes which are now
collected and administered or as otherwise provided by this article.
B. The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from the
rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted for and charged for, and upon
every evidence of occupancy or any bill or statement of charges made
for said occupancy issued or delivered by the operator, and the tax shall
be paid by the occupant to the operator as trustee for and on account of
the Village, and the operator shall be liable for the collection thereof
and for the tax. The operator and any officer of any corporate operator
shall be personally liable for the tax collected or required to be
collected under this article, and the operator shall have the same rights
in respect to collecting the tax from the occupant, or in respect to
nonpayment of the tax by the occupant, as if the tax were part of the
rent for the occupancy payable at the time such tax shall become due
and owing, including all rights of eviction, dispossession, repossession
and enforcement of any innkeeper's lien that he/she may have in the
event of nonpayment of the rent by the occupant; provided, however,
that the Treasurer or employees or agents duly designated by him/her
shall be joined as a party in any action or proceeding brought by the
operator to collect or enforce collection of the tax.
C. The Treasurer may, whenever he/she deems it necessary for the proper
enforcement of this article, provide by regulation that the occupant
shall file returns and pay directly to the Treasurer the tax imposed at
such times as returns are required to be filed and payment made over
by the operator.
D. The tax imposed by this article shall be paid upon any occupancy on and
after March 1, 2017. Where rent is paid or charged or billed or falls due
on either a weekly, monthly or other term basis, the rent so paid,
charged, billed or falling due shall be subject to the tax herein imposed
to the extent that it covers any portion of the period on and after March
1, 2017. Where any tax has been paid hereunder upon any rent which
has been ascertained to be worthless, the Treasurer may, by regulation,
provide for credit and/or refund of the amount of such tax upon
application therefor as provided in § 180-61 of this article.
E. For the purpose of the proper administration of this article and to
prevent evasion of the tax hereby imposed, it shall be presumed that all
rents are subject to tax until the contrary is established, and the burden
of proving that a rent for occupancy is not taxable hereunder shall be
upon the operator or occupant. Where an occupant claims exemption
from the tax under the provisions of § 180-52 of this article, the rent
shall be deemed taxable hereunder unless the operator shall receive
from the occupant claiming such exemption a copy of a New York State
sales tax exemption certificate.
§ 180-55 SWIMMING POOLS § 180-56
178:413
§ 180-56. Records to be kept.
Every operator shall keep records of every occupancy and of all rent paid,
charged or due thereon and of the tax payable thereon, in such form as
the Treasurer may by regulation require. Such records shall be available
for inspection and examination at any time upon demand by the Treasurer
or his/her duly authorized agent or employee and shall be preserved for
a period of three years, except that the Treasurer may consent to their
destruction within that period or may require that they be kept together.
§ 180-57. Filing of returns.
§ 180-58. Determination of tax; reviewability.
Any final determination of the amount of any tax payable hereunder shall
be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason
whatsoever by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules if application therefor is made to the Supreme Court within 30
days after giving the State of New York notice of such final determination;
provided, however, that any such proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules shall not be instituted unless:
A. Every operator shall file with the Treasurer a return of occupancy and
of rents and of the taxes payable thereon for the three-month periods
ending the last day of February, May, August and November on and
after March 1, 2017. Such returns shall be filed within 20 days from the
expiration of the period covered thereby. The Treasurer may permit or
require returns to be made for other periods upon such dates as he/she
may specify. If the Treasurer deems it necessary, in order to ensure the
payment of the tax imposed by this article, he/she may require returns
to be made for shorter periods than those prescribed pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this section and upon such dates as he/she may
specify.
B. The forms of return shall be prescribed by the Treasurer and shall
contain such information as he/she may deem necessary for the proper
administration of this article. The Treasurer may require amended
returns to be filed within 20 days after notice and to contain the
information specified in the notice.
C. If a return required by this article is not filed, or if a return is
incorrectly filed or is insufficient on its face, the Treasurer shall take
such steps as he/she deems necessary to enforce the filing of such
return or of a corrected return.
A. The amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with such interest and
penalties thereon as may be provided for by local laws or regulations,
shall be first deposited, and there shall be filed an undertaking, issued
by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and
approved by the Superintendent of Insurance of this state as to
solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a Justice of the Supreme
§ 180-56 ARDSLEY CODE § 180-58
178:414
§ 180-59. Payment of taxes.
At the time of filing a return of occupancy and of rents, each operator
shall pay to the Treasurer the taxes imposed by this article upon the rents
required to be included in such return, as well as all other moneys collected
by the operator acting or purporting to act under the provisions of this
article; even though it be judicially determined that the tax collected is
invalidly required to be filed, it shall be due from the operator and payable
to the Treasurer on the date prescribed herein for the filing of the return
for such period, without regard to whether a return is filed or whether the
return which is filed correctly shows the amount of rents and taxes due
thereon. Where the Treasurer in his/her discretion deems it necessary to
protect revenues to be obtained under this article, he/she may require any
operator required to collect the tax imposed by this article to file with him/
her a bond, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in
this state and approved by the Superintendent of Insurance of this state
as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as the Treasurer may
find to secure the payment of any tax and/or penalties and interest due or
which may become due from such operator. In the event that the Treasurer
determines that an operator is to file such bonds, he/she shall give notice
to such operator to that effect, specifying the amount of the bond required.
The operator shall file such bond within five days after the giving of such
notice unless, within such five days, the operator shall request, in writing, a
hearing before the Treasurer at which the necessity, propriety and amount
of the bond shall be determined by the Treasurer. Such determination shall
be final and shall be complied with within 15 days after the giving of notice
thereof. In lieu of such bond, securities approved by the Treasurer or cash in
such amount as he/she may prescribe may be deposited with him/her, which
shall be kept in the custody of the Treasurer, who may at any time, without
notice of the depositor, apply them to any tax and/or interest or penalties
due, and for that purpose the securities may be sold by him/her at public or
private sale without notice to the depositor thereof.
§ 180-60. Disposition of revenues.
All revenue resulting from the imposition of the tax under this article
shall be paid into the treasury of the Village and shall be credited to and
deposited in the general fund of the Village.
Court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed
or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which
may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding; or
B. At the option of the petitioner, such undertaking may be in a sum
sufficient to cover the taxes, interests and penalties stated in such
determination, plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it
in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the petitioner shall
not be required to pay such taxes, interests or penalties as a condition
precedent to the application.
§ 180-58 SWIMMING POOLS § 180-61
178:415
§ 180-61. Refunds.
A. In the manner provided in this section, the Treasurer shall refund or
credit, without interest, any tax penalty or interest erroneously, illegally
or unconstitutionally collected or paid if application to the Treasurer for
such refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof.
Whenever a refund is made by the Treasurer, he/she shall state his/her
reason therefor in writing. Such application may be made by the
occupant, operator or other person who has actually paid the tax. Such
application may also be made by an operator who has collected and
paid over such tax to the Treasurer, provided that the application is
made within one year of the payment to the operator, but no actual
refund of moneys shall be made to such operator until it shall first
establish to the satisfaction of the Treasurer, under such regulations as
the Treasurer may prescribe, that it has repaid to the occupant, or
other person who has actually paid the tax, the amount for which the
application for refund is made. The Treasurer may, in lieu of any refund
required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due or to
become due from the applicant.
B. An application for a refund or credit made as herein provided shall be
deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest
complained of, and the Treasurer may receive evidence with respect
thereto. After making his/her determination, the Treasurer shall give
notice thereof to the applicant, who shall be entitled to review such
determination by a proceeding pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules, provided that such proceeding is instituted
within 30 days after the giving of the notice of such determination, and
provided that a final determination of tax due was not previously made.
Such a proceeding shall not be instituted unless an undertaking is filed
with the Treasurer in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of
the Supreme Court shall approve to the effect that, if such proceedings
be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay costs and
charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.
C. Under this section, a person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or
credit of a tax, interest or penalty which had been determined to be due
pursuant to the provisions of § 180-64 of this article where it has had a
hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section, or
has failed to avail itself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or
credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a
determination by the Treasurer made pursuant to § 180-64 of this
article, unless it be found that such determination was erroneous,
illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper by the Treasurer after
a hearing or on his/her own motion or in a proceeding under Article 78
of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, pursuant to the provisions of said
section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made
of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.
§ 180-61 ARDSLEY CODE § 180-62
178:416
§ 180-62. Reserves.
In cases where the occupant or operator has applied for a refund and has
instituted a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules
to review a determination adverse to him/her on his/her application for
refund, the Treasurer shall have the option of crediting future tax payments
to meet the cost of any settlements or judgments or, at his/her option,
may, in the first instance, set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision
adverse to the Village.
§ 180-63. Remedies exclusive.
The remedies provided by §§ 180-58 and 180-61 of this article shall be the
exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability
imposed by this article, and no determination or proposed determination
of tax or determination on any application for refund shall be enjoined or
reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money had
and received or by any action or proceeding other than a proceeding in a
nature of a certiorari proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer may proceed by declaratory
judgment if he/she institutes suit within 30 days after a deficiency
assessment is made and pays the amount of the deficiency assessment to
the Treasurer prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for costs
as provided in § 180-59 of this article.
§ 180-64. Penalties for offenses; interest.
A. Any person failing to file a return or to pay or pay over any tax to the
Treasurer within the time required by this article shall be subject to a
penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due per month or any fraction of a
month to a maximum of 25% for each year, plus interest at the rate of
1% of such tax for each month of delay or fraction of a month after such
return was required to be filed or such tax became due but the
Treasurer, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any
part of such penalty, but not interest. Such net penalties and interest
shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues
from this article. Unpaid penalties and interest may be enforced in the
same manner as the tax imposed by this article.
B. Any operator or occupant and any officer of an operator or occupant
failing to file a return required by this article, or filing or causing to be
filed or making or causing to be made or giving or causing to be given
any return, certificate, affidavit, representation, information, testimony
or statement required or authorized by this article which is willfully
false, and any operator and any officer of a corporate operator willfully
failing to file a bond required to be filed pursuant to § 180-59 of this
article, or failing to file a registration certificate and such data in
connection therewith as the Treasurer may by regulation or otherwise
require, or failing to display or surrender the certificate of authority as
required by this article or assigning or transferring such certificate of

authority, and any operator or any officer of a corporate operator
willfully failing to charge separately from the rent the tax herein
imposed or willfully failing to state such tax separately on any evidence
of occupancy and on any bill or statement or receipt of rent issued
or employed by the operator or willfully failing or refusing to collect
such tax from the occupant; any operator or any officer of a corporate
operator who shall refer or cause reference to be made to this tax in a
form or manner other than that required by this article, and any such
person or operator failing to keep records required by this article, shall,
in addition to the penalties herein or elsewhere prescribed, be guilty of
a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, imprisonment for
not more than one year, or both such fine and imprisonment. Officers
of a corporate operator shall be personally liable for the tax collected
or required to be collected by such corporation under this article,
and penalties and interest thereon, and subject to the fines and
imprisonment herein authorized.
C. The certificate of the Treasurer to the effect that a tax has not been
paid, that a return, bond or registration certificate has not been filed or
that information has not been supplied pursuant to the provisions of
this article shall be presumptive evidence thereof.
D. Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with intent to
evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the
expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a
return; provided, however, that where no return has been filed as
provided by law, the tax may be assessed at any time.
A. It shall be unlawful, except in accordance with proper judicial order or
as otherwise provided to the fullest extent permitted by law, for the
Treasurer or employee or designee of the Treasurer to divulge or make
known in any manner the rents or other information relating to the
business of a taxpayer contained in any return required under this
article. The officers charged with the custody of such returns shall not
be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained
in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the
Treasurer in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this article
or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the
provisions of this article when the returns or facts shown thereby are
directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which events
the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so
much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby as are pertinent to
the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit the delivery to a taxpayer or his/her duly
authorized representative of a certified copy of any return filed in
connection with his/her tax, nor to prohibit the publication of statistics
so classified to prevent the identification of particular returns and items
thereof, or the inspection by the Village Attorney or other legal

review the tax based thereon, or against whom an action or proceeding
has been instituted for the collection of a tax or penalty. Returns shall
be preserved for three years and thereafter until the Treasurer permits
them to be destroyed.
B. Any violation of Subsection A of this section shall be punishable by a
fine not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment not exceeding one year,
or both, in the discretion of the court, and if the offender is an officer or
employee of the Village, he/she may be, at the discretion of the Village
Manager, dismissed from office and be incapable of holding any further
Village office as may be determined according to law.
A. Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article
may be given to the person to whom it is intended in a postpaid
envelope addressed to such person at the address given in the last
return filed by him/her pursuant to the provisions of this article or in
any application made by him/her or, if no return has been filed or
application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The
mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of
the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is
determined according to the provisions of this article by the giving of
notice shall commence five days after the date of mailing of such notice.
B. The provisions of the Civil Practice Law and Rules or any other law
relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy shall
not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the Village to levy,
appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of any tax or
penalty provided by this article. However, except in the case of a
willfully false, fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no
assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more
than three years from the date of filing of a return; provided, however,
that in the case of a return which should have been filed and has not
been filed as provided by law, the tax may be assessed at any time.
C. Where, before expiration of the period prescribed herein for the
assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented, in writing,
that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due
may be determined at any time within such extended period. The period
so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents, in
writing, made before the expiration of the extended period.

§ 181-1. Purposes.
§ 181-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ANTENNA  A device used in communications that converts radio
frequency electrical energy to radiated electromagnetic energy and vice
versa; in a transmitting station, an "antenna" is the device from which radio
waves are emitted.
A. The purpose of this chapter is to establish regulations for the siting of
wireless communication antennas and towers that are consistent with
the Telecommunications Act of 1996. This chapter is intended to:
(1) Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
(2) Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing antenna and
tower sites;
(3) Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimized;
(4) Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and
antennas; and
(5) Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and
efficiently.
B. The classification of personal wireless service facilities as a special
permit use is made solely in recognition of the village's responsibilities
under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and no presumption should
be derived from this classification that this use is harmonious with the
general zoning plan of the village and will not adversely affect
neighborhood character.
§ 180-67 ARDSLEY CODE § 181-2
181:420
COLLOCATION  The mounting of personal wireless service facilities used
by two or more persons, firms or corporations on the same equipment
mounting structure.
EQUIPMENT MOUNTING STRUCTURE  Any structure used primarily to
support reception or transmission equipment, including, but not limited to,
antenna support structures, towers and monopoles.
PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICES  Commercial mobile services, wireless
telecommunications services using duly authorized devices that do not
require individual licenses (excluding satellite earth station antennas) and
common carrier wireless exchanges, including cellular radiotelephone,
specialized mobile radio system and personal communications services.
PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICE FACILITY  A facility for the provision
of personal wireless services. A personal wireless service facility includes
an antenna, equipment-mounting structure and/or accessory buildings and
equipment.

Except as specified in § 181-16 (Special permits for sites outside the
Personal Wireless Service Facilities Overlay District), all new personal
wireless service facilities, and all additions and/or modifications to currently
existing personal wireless service facilities, shall be allowed only:

are hereby established as shown on the map entitled "Personal Wireless
Service Facilities Overlay District," dated June 7, 1999, and from time to
time amended, which map is hereby made a part of this chapter.81

required by Chapter 4 of the Ardsley Code.
§ 181-8. Criteria for special permit applications.
Applicants for special permits for establishment or construction of personal
wireless service facilities shall meet all of the following criteria:
B. In addition to the notice required for a zoning variance, the applicant
shall give 14 days' written notice to the legislative body of each
municipality that borders the village, as well as to the County Planning
Board. Notice shall include the exact location of the proposed personal
wireless service facility and a general description of the project.
A. Necessity. The proposed personal wireless service facility is required to
provide service to locations within the village that the applicant is not
able to serve with existing facilities that are located within and outside
the village, by collocation and otherwise.
B. Collocation.
(1) The collocation of existing personal wireless service facilities only
within the Personal Wireless Service Facilities Overlay District
shall be strongly preferred to the construction of new personal
wireless service facilities.
(2) Approval of a proposal to share space on an existing personal
wireless service facility within the Personal Wireless Service
Facilities Overlay District shall be conditioned upon the applicant's
agreement to pay the reasonable costs of adapting an existing
facility to a new shared use. These costs can include, but are not
limited to, structural reinforcement, prevention of transmission or
receiver interference, additional site screening and other changes
required to accommodate shared use.
(3) If a new site for a personal wireless service facility is proposed, the
applicant must demonstrate that the proposed personal wireless
service facility cannot be accommodated on an existing personal
wireless service facility within the village or on an existing facility
in another municipality due to one or more of the following
reasons:
(a) Service to the locations to which the applicant seeks to provide
service cannot be provided by existing facilities within or
outside the village.
(b) Adequate and reliable service cannot be provided from existing
sites in a financially and technologically feasible manner
consistent with the applicant's system requirements.
§ 181-6 TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 181-8
181:425
(c) Existing sites cannot accommodate the proposed personal
wireless service facility due to structural or other engineering
limitations, such as frequency incompatibilities.
(d) The applicant has been unable to come to a reasonable
agreement to collocate on another personal wireless service
facility. The applicant shall provide the names, addresses,
phone and FAX numbers of other service providers
approached, along with a written statement as to why an
agreement to collocate could not be reached.
(e) Other reasons make it impracticable to place the proposed
equipment on existing and approved personal wireless service
facility within the village or existing facilities in other
municipalities.
C. Location on existing tall structure. Where collocation is unavailable,
location of a personal wireless service facility on a preexisting tall
structure, such as a water tank, utility pole, church spire, etc., shall be
preferred to the construction of a tower or monopole. The applicant
must demonstrate that it has made good faith efforts to locate the
personal wireless service facility on each existing tall structure in the
Personal Wireless Service Facilities Overlay District, but that, for
physical, technical and/or financial reasons, or because of the inability
to obtain a lease, the personal wireless service facility cannot be
accommodated on any existing tall structure in the PWSF District.
D. Maximum height and size.
(1) Unless the Federal Communications Commission promulgates
rules to the contrary or the applicant demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Board of Trustees that a greater height is
necessary, the maximum height for an antenna mounted on another
structure shall be six feet above the highest point of the building or
structure on which it is installed. The maximum height for a tower
or monopole shall be 125 feet above ground level or the minimum
height necessary to provide service to locations that the applicant
is not able to serve with existing' facilities within and outside the
village, whichever is less. The Board of Trustees may permit a
tower or monopole to be higher than the minimum necessary to
provide service to such locations if such additional height is
necessary to accommodate collocation of other personal wireless
service facilities on the same tower or monopole.
(2) Accessory structures shall be the minimum size necessary to house
the equipment for the personal wireless service facility, but in no
event shall they be larger than 250 square feet (inside dimensions)
per carrier.
(3) The provisions of this section shall supersede any contrary
provision in the Zoning Code of the Village of Ardsley.82

TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS
§ 181-20 ARDSLEY CODE § 181-20
181:432
ARTICLE I
Sale of Tobacco, Liquid Nicotine Products and Electronic Cigarettes
[Adopted 12-18-2018 by L.L. No. 4-2018]
§ 182-1. Legislative intent.
§ 182-2. Definitions.
As used in this article the following terms shall the meanings indicated:
NICOTINE DELIVERY PRODUCT  Any article or product made wholly
or in part of a tobacco substitute or otherwise containing nicotine that is
expected or intended for human consumption, but not including a tobacco
substitute prescribed by a licensed physician or a product that has been
approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for sale as
a tobacco use cessation or harm reduction product or for other medical
purposes and which is being marketed and sold solely for that purpose.
A. The Village Board hereby finds and determines that the Village of
Ardsley has a substantial interest in reducing the number of individuals
of all ages who use cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine products,
and a particular interest in protecting adolescents from tobacco
dependence and the illnesses and premature death associated with
tobacco and nicotine use. Tobacco companies sell products that are
addictive and inherently dangerous, causing cancer, heart disease and
other serious illnesses. Primary tobacco use is a major cause of
mortality and morbidity, directly causing an estimated 480,000 deaths
per year in the United States, more deaths than are caused by the use of
any other legal or illegal substance or drug. An overwhelming majority
of Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products
while they are adolescents and become addicted before reaching the
age of 18. The Surgeon General of the United States has concluded that
if young people do not start using tobacco by age 26, they almost
certainly will never start. The effects of smoking generated by smoking
cigars, cigarettes, pipes, and similar articles pose a threat to the health,
safety and well-being of youths within the Village of Ardsley. Therefore,
it is the intent of the Village of Ardsley to reduce the youth smoking rate
by prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to persons under the age of
21.
B. The Village Board further finds that the Village has substantial interest
in responding to the increased use of electronic cigarettes and nicotine
delivery products among adolescents. E-cigarettes are now the most
commonly used tobacco product among youth, having surpassed
conventional cigarettes in 2014. Public health authorities and agencies,
including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and United
States Surgeon General, have advised that the use of e-cigarettes and
nicotine delivery products poses significant and avoidable health risks
to young people.
§ 182-1 TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 182-2
181:433
Nicotine delivery products include, but are not limited to, e-cigarettes,
vapes, vaporizers, vape pens, lozenges or other candy, drinks or inhalers.
PERSON  A person, firm, company, corporation, partnership, sole
proprietor, limited partnership or association.
TOBACCO PRODUCTS  One or more cigarettes or cigars, bidis, chewing
tobacco, powdered tobacco, blunt papers or wrappers, cigarette rolling
papers of any kind, or any other tobacco products.
VAPE SHOP  A retail outlet with 25% of its retail space devoted to selling
or distributing of any tobacco products as defined herein, including but not
limited to selling or distributing any electronic cigarette or vapor products,
including but not limited to electronic cigarettes, vape pens, dissolvable
liquids, vaporizing liquids, oils or gels, mods, atomizers, vape tanks and coil

Self-service displays of tobacco products or nicotine delivery products
shall be prohibited.
B. No person shall sell tobacco products, liquid nicotine products or
nicotine delivery products to any person under the age of 21 years or,
not being his/her parent or guardian, give tobacco products or nicotine
delivery products to any person under the age of 21.
C. The sale of tobacco products, liquid nicotine products and nicotine
delivery products shall only be made to an individual who demonstrates
through a government-issued photographic identification containing
the bearer's date of birth that no person purchasing the tobacco or
nicotine containing products is younger than 21 years of age. No such
verification is required for any person who reasonably appears to be
over the age of 26. No clerk shall sell tobacco products or nicotine
delivery products to a person under 21 years of age who has a note from
an adult requesting such a sale.
A. A vape shop may only be located in those districts enumerated on the
Zoning Map of the Village of Ardsley as District B-1 or B-2. A vape shop
shall not be located within 500 feet of the lot line of any park,
playground, library, religious institution or public community center.

exceeds the number of available units, units shall be allotted:
(a) By category;
(b) By chronological order of filing; and
(c) By lottery, if necessary.

Its future sale (including resale) or rent must be to persons who
qualify with the income requirements and at a price in accordance
with the program."
(2) Legal assurances. Each application for a proposed development
containing workforce and affordable housing units shall be
accompanied by appropriate undertakings, deed restrictions,
easements and the like, in form and content satisfactory to the
Village Attorney, as may be necessary to provide for and assure
continued proper future maintenance and ownership
responsibilities for all common areas, facilities and utilities within
each stage of development or section thereof.
(3) Other assurances. The Planning Board may condition its
recommendation of approval of a development containing

obtaining any other necessary approvals from the appropriate
Village, county or state agencies having jurisdiction thereof.

CCH District: Conservation or Clustered Housing District
[Added 12-14-1983 by L.L. No. 7-1983]
§ 200-30. Intent; objectives.
§ 200-31. Districts created. [Amended 3-18-1996 by L.L. No.
1-1996]
A. The Board of Trustees finds that the topography of certain parcels on
the Village Tax Map do not lend themselves to the conventional
development as designated by their current zoning. It also finds that it
is essential to the public health, safety and general welfare to
encourage such forms of residential construction as will promote the
conservation of the remaining open space, preserve and enhance
natural beauty and resources and permit reasonable development of
large plots of land. It further finds that the creation of a Clustered
Housing District will substantially promote the conservation and
enhancement of natural beauty and resources.
B. Among the objectives which should be achieved through use of the CCH
Clustered Housing District are the following:
(1) The creative use of land so as to establish a more desirable living
environment than would be possible through the strict application
of other sections of this article.
(2) The preservation of water bodies, wetlands, steep slopes, hilltops,
ridgelines, major stands of trees, outstanding natural topography,
significant geological features and other areas of scenic and
ecological values and the prevention of soil erosion.
(3) Innovation, flexibility and variety in the type, design and layout of
residential housing so as to permit greater variety in the choice of
housing type, living environment and housing costs.
(4) A district in harmony with the planning objectives of the Village.
A. A Conservation or Clustered Housing District (CCH), known as
"CCH-1," was created by Local Law No. 7-1983.
B. For the purpose of implementing recommendations as set forth in the
Ardsley Business District Plan of 1994 and, more specifically, to
encourage diversity of use, reduce potential future traffic generation,
protect steep slopes, provide alternative housing opportunities and
protect the residential character of the Village, an additional
Conservation or Clustered Housing District is hereby created and shall
be known as "CCH-2."
C. CCH Districts may be developed pursuant to a site plan subject to this
article and to the density requirements of the R-3 District.

§ 200-33. Horizontal construction prohibited. [Amended 3-18-1996
by L.L. No. 1-1996]
Construction of dwelling units in a horizontal design, i.e., one over the other,
shall not be permitted.
D. Notwithstanding front, rear and side yard restrictions otherwise
contained in this Zoning Chapter and subject to the conditions set forth
in this article, dwelling units may be in attached, semidetached,
detached, grouped or clustered form.
E. The site plan design shall provide for the grouping or clustering of
houses so that each cluster is set off from the others and from adjacent
property by intervening open space with the intention of permanently
preserving the undeveloped land and of permanently preserving as
much of the existing foliage as possible, particularly around the
perimeter of the site.
F. Conserved land areas. A CCH District shall result in the preservation of
open space areas having meaningful scenic, ecological, environmental
and/or recreational characteristics, with such access, shape, size and
location as determined to be appropriate by the Planning Board and
acceptable to the Board of Trustees to satisfy the intended purpose. The
permanent preservation of such open space areas shall be legally
assured in accordance with the provisions of this article by the filing of
appropriate covenants, deed restrictions, easements or other
agreements in recordable form acceptable to the Village Attorney to
accomplish the restriction of any and all subsequent residential or other
development and/or the modification of the minimum density or other
requirements of this article.
A. In a CCH District, the total number of individual family dwelling units
shall not exceed the number permitted if the land were subdivided into
lots conforming to all normally applicable requirements of this Zoning
Chapter, the Land Subdivision Regulations, the Westchester County
Health Department Regulations and all other applicable requirements
of the R-3 District (7,500 square feet). Each structure shall comply with
the building standards of the R-3 District and with all other
requirements of this article, except that houses may be clustered or
attached, semidetached or detached. The side, front and rear yard
setbacks of attached or semiattached dwelling units shall also comply
with the standards of the R-3 District, except as expressly modified by
the Board of Trustees when approving the site plan, but, if the dwellings
are detached, such setbacks may be reduced by not more than 50%.

L.L. No. 1-1996]
The following off-street parking, loading and related requirements shall
apply in connection with any application for the use, erection, enlargement
or alteration of any building or for the change in any use which would
increase the number of off-street parking or loading spaces required. All
off-street parking, loading and related improvements shall be satisfactorily
maintained by the owner of the property for the duration of the buildings or
uses being served:
A. Dwellings: at least one parking space for each dwelling unit in the
building or buildings.
B. Auditoriums, theaters or other places of public assemblage: at least one
parking space for each three seats provided for its patrons (based on
maximum seating capacity).
C. Restaurants: at least one parking space for each three seats or for each
75 square feet of floor area, whichever requirement is greater.
D. Retail and personal service businesses: at least one parking space for
each 150 square feet of floor area.

the above categories shall be determined by the Village Board of
Trustees, after review and report by the Planning Board, as a part of the
site plan and/or special permit approval process.
I. All parking spaces provided pursuant to this section shall be on the
same lot with the building, except that the Board of Appeals may permit
the parking spaces to be on any lot within 500 feet of the building, if it
determines that it is impractical to provide parking on the same lot with
the building.
J. Where two or more different uses are served by the same parking
facility, the total number of parking spaces required shall be the sum of
the requirements for each individual use, except that the Board of
Trustees may approve, after review and report by the Planning Board,
the joint use of parking spaces by two or more different uses on the
same or contiguous lots, provided that the total number of spaces is no
more than 1/3 less than the sum of the spaces required. In such case,
the Board of Trustees shall find that the capacity to be provided will
substantially meet the intent of the requirements of this chapter by
§ 200-71 VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 200-71
194:537
reason of variation in the probable time of maximum use by patrons
and employees of such establishments, and provided that such approval
of joint use of parking spaces shall be automatically terminated upon
the termination of the operation of one or more of the establishments
served. If more than one lot is involved, the Board of Trustees shall
require, as a condition of its approval, a legal instrument in form
satisfactory to the Village Attorney, assuring the continued use of such
joint parking facilities in connection with the uses they are intended to
serve.
K. Fee in lieu of off-street parking.
(1) At the request of the property owner, the Village Board of Trustees,
after review and report by the Planning Board, may accept the
payment of a fee in substitution for providing some or all of the
required off-street parking spaces, provided that the Board finds
that the required number of spaces cannot reasonably be provided
on the site. Such fee in lieu of providing parking shall be applicable
only within the B-1 District and shall be assessed at the rate of
$10,000 for each space. This fee is based upon the estimated cost
for land acquisition, demolition and construction of municipal
parking in the B-1 District. Any such payments shall be placed in a
special trust fund to be used exclusively for public parking space
purposes to benefit the B-1 District. The fee may be paid in full at
the time of site plan approval or over a period not to exceed 10
years, with interest, in accordance with terms and conditions to be
mutually agreed upon by the property owner and the Board of
Trustees.
(2) By acceptance of the fee in lieu, the Village of Ardsley undertakes
to provide parking of a type, location and quantity appropriate to
help meet the needs of the properties for which fees have been
paid. The Village may charge for the use of such spaces an amount
consistent with the charge for other publicly provided parking in
the B-1 District. All expenditures from the parking trust fund shall
be designed to increase the quantity and/or the quality of municipal
parking available to serve the B-1 District.
L. Off-street loading.
(1) Retail and service business establishments, restaurants and banks:
at least one loading space shall be provided for each 10,000 square
feet of floor area or major portion thereof.
(2) Offices: at least one loading space shall be provided for each
25,000 square feet of floor area or major portion thereof.
(3) Off-street loading requirements for land uses which do not fall
within the categories listed above shall be determined by the
Village Board of Trustees, after review and report by the Planning
Board, as a part of the site plan and/or special permit approval
process.
§ 200-71 ARDSLEY CODE § 200-71
194:538
M. Waiver of improvement. Where the Board of Trustees, in connection
with its review of a site plan, determines that the immediate use of any
property may not warrant the full improvement of all required off-street
parking and/or loading spaces, the Board, after review and report by
the Planning Board, may waive the improvement of up to 1/3 of the total
number of such spaces, subject to the following conditions:
(1) It shall be expressly demonstrated on the site plan that sufficient
space remains for the provision of the total amount of off-street
parking and loading required.
(2) Any unimproved portions of the parking and loading facility shall
be used and maintained as additional landscaped area until and
unless required for parking and loading purposes.
(3) Written guaranties, subject to approval by the Village Attorney,
shall be submitted by the property owner ensuring the
improvement of all or such portion of the waived parking and/or
loading facilities as the Board of Trustees may, in the future,
determine to be necessary. Such improvement shall be completed
within six months of the date of the mailing to the property owner
of a copy of a Board of Trustees resolution deeming that such
spaces, in said Board's opinion, have become necessary and must
be constructed.
N. Landscaping of off-street parking and loading areas. All off-street
parking and loading facilities shall be curbed, screened and landscaped
with appropriate trees, shrubs, ground cover and other plant materials
to assure the establishment of a safe, convenient and attractive facility
and shall comply with the following requirements:
(1) In all off-street parking areas containing 25 or more parking
spaces, at least 10% of the parking area shall be curbed and
landscaped with trees, shrubs and other plant materials as
determined appropriate by the Board of Trustees.
(2) For the purpose of preventing the diagonal movement of vehicles,
alleviating the visual impact of large expanses of paved areas and
otherwise improving traffic and pedestrian safety, raised
landscaped islands shall be provided wherever possible. Such
landscaped islands shall be located at the ends of each parking bay
containing 10 or more spaces and separating opposing rows of
parking spaces. The minimum width of landscaped islands shall be
six feet where located at the ends of parking bays and eight feet in
other locations.
(3) At least one tree of not less than four inches caliper measured at a
height of three feet above grade shall be provided within such
parking area for each eight parking spaces.
(4) The selection, amount and location of landscaping materials shall
be based upon consideration of the adequacy of the proposed
§ 200-71 VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 200-71
194:539
landscaping to serve its intended purpose with a minimum of
nuisance and maintenance problems, including plant care,
snowplowing and leaf removal.
(5) All landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy growing condition
throughout the duration of the structure or use which it is intended
to serve. Any planting not so maintained shall be replaced with new
plants at the beginning of the next, immediately following growing
season.

off-street parking and loading areas from neighboring properties in
residence districts.
(7) Landscaping shall also be provided along the periphery of all offstreet
parking and loading areas where they abut streets and other
neighboring properties.
(8) The selection, design and arrangement of landscaping shall take
into consideration the need to maintain clear sight distance for
drivers entering, exiting and circulating around the off-street
parking and loading area.
(9) All landscaping plans shall be subject to approval by the Board of
Trustees, after review and report by the Planning Board.
O. Lighting. All off-street parking and loading areas shall be suitably
lighted to provide for the safety and convenience of those using such
facilities. Illumination shall be of such type and location, and shall have
such shading, as will prevent the source of the light, or any
objectionable glare, from being observable from any neighboring
streets or properties. The location of lighting facilities shall be
coordinated with the landscaping plan so as to assure adequate
coverage of all areas. The lighting plan shall be subject to approval of
the Board of Trustees, after review and report by the Planning Board.
P. Striping. All parking spaces shall be separated by double painted lines
in accordance with the Typical Parking Space Details as shown on
Detail 1.96

provided in all off-street parking and loading areas to properly control
and direct traffic flow. The design and location of such signage shall be
based on accepted engineering practice and subject to approval by the
Board of Trustees, after review and report by the Planning Board.
R. Aisles. All parking spaces shall be designed at a 90° angle with a
twenty-four-foot-wide two-way maneuvering aisle unless a different
width or angle is permitted or required by the Board of Trustees based

§ 200-82 ARDSLEY CODE § 200-82
194:562
(1) Approval required. The purpose of this subsection is to streamline
the site development plan approval process in the Village of Ardsley
by establishing procedures and standards for securing
administrative approval of proposed change of use applications and
minor site plan modifications involving property located in the B-1,
B-2, B-3, RO and CCH Districts.
(2) Where site development plan approval is required by the terms of
this chapter or by resolution by the Village Board or Planning
Board, no building permit shall be issued by the Building Inspector
until such a plan has been approved by the Village Board or
Planning Board. Furthermore, no certificate of occupancy or use
shall be issued for such premises until all of the requirements of the
Board's approval, including any conditions attached thereto, shall
have been met. Continued conformance with such plan and
requirements shall be a condition of the continued validity of the
certificate of occupancy or use. Except as provided for in
§§ 200-82F(3)(a) and 200-82F(4)(a) herein, revisions of such plans
to reflect site development plan modifications, including but not
limited to changes of use, shall be subject to these approval
requirements.
(3) Change of use.
(a) Where a change of use from one permitted use requiring site
development plan approval to another permitted use requiring
site development plan approval is proposed for premises
located in a business or industrial district, such change of use
shall not require site development plan approval by the Village
Board or Planning Board prior to the issuance of a building
permit or a certificate of occupancy or use by the Building
Inspector, provided that the following conditions have been
satisfied:
[1] There are no existing violations on the premises, whether
or not of record.
[2] The existing use of the premises shall be shown on a site
development plan previously approved by the Village
Board or Planning Board and recorded in the Village.
[3] The requirements of § 200-71 of this chapter shall have
been satisfied in all respects.
[4] There shall be no enlargement of the existing building.
[5] The proposed use shall not result in an increase in
intensity of use that will affect the characteristics of the
site in terms of access, traffic circulation, parking,
pedestrian movement, loading and unloading, noise,
stormwater drainage, water supply, sanitary sewage
§ 200-82 VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 200-82
194:563
disposal or site lighting as determined by the Building
Inspector.
(b) If all of the above conditions can be met, the Building Inspector
may, in his discretion, review and approve the proposed
change of use in accordance with all other applicable
provisions of this code, prior to issuing a building permit or a
certificate of occupancy or use. If any of the above conditions
cannot be met, site development plan approval by the Village
Board or Planning Board shall be required. Irrespective of the
foregoing, the Building Inspector is reserved the right to
forward any and all applications pursuant to this section to the
Village Board of Trustees for hearing and review.
(4) Modifications to approved plan.
(a) Where any other modification to a previously approved site
development plan is proposed for premises located in a B-1,
B-2, B-3, RO, or CCH District, such modification shall not
require amended site development plan approval by the Village
Board or Planning Board prior to the issuance of a building
permit or a certificate of occupancy or use by the Building
Inspector, provided that the following conditions are met:
[1] There are no existing violations on the premises, whether
or not of record.
[2] The proposed modification(s) shall not involve the
construction of building additions or the construction of
any structural additions other than handicap access
ramps, stairs, walks, decks or fences that do not violate the
lot and bulk requirements of this chapter.
[3] The proposed modification(s), including but not limited to
the addition of proposed landscaping, shall not involve any
changes that may conflict with recommended minimum
sight line standards.
[4] The proposed modifications shall not result in an increase
of use that will affect the characteristics of the site in
terms of access, traffic circulation, parking, pedestrian
movement, loading and unloading, stormwater drainage,
water supply, sanitary sewage disposal or site lighting.
[5] The proposed modification(s) shall not involve any
regulated wetlands, steep slopes or trees, as set forth in
§§ 200-92 and 200-93. Irrespective of the foregoing, the
Building Inspector is reserved the right to forward any and
all applications pursuant to this section to the Village
Board of Trustees for hearing and review.

(b) If all the above conditions are satisfied, the Building Inspector
may review and approve the proposed site development plan
modification(s) in accordance with all other applicable
provisions of this code prior to issuing a building permit or a
certificate of occupancy or use. If any of the above conditions
cannot be met, site development plan approval by the Village
Board or Planning Board shall be required. Irrespective of the
foregoing, the Building Inspector is reserved the right to
forward any and all applications pursuant to this section to the
Village Board of Trustees for hearing and review.
G. The Board of Trustees may grant a special permit to property owners
who, at the Village's request, transfer land to the New York State
Department of Transportation, the Village of Ardsley or any other
governmental agency or municipality for highway widening or
improvement purposes, when such owner has waived all rights to
compensation thereof. The special permit shall specify that all
applicable setback, density and other bulk and area zoning
requirements shall be calculated as if the transferred land had been
retained. This provision shall apply to all pending and previously
approved site plans. No special permit shall be granted unless the
following findings are made by the Board of Trustees concerning the
particular application: [Added 8-1-2011 by L.L. No. 2-2011]
(1) That, at the Village's request, the owner has transferred or has
offered to transfer land to the New York State Department of
Transportation, the Village of Ardsley or any other governmental
agency or municipality for highway widening or improvement
purposes.
(2) That the transfer is for a public purpose and is in the public
interest.
(3) That the owner has waived all rights to compensation for the land
transferred or to be transferred.
(4) That the Board of Trustees finds that granting the special permit is
necessary and desirable, and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare, and
shall be consistent with the provisions of § 200-97C(1) through
(11).
(5) In addition to all of the foregoing reasons, the Board of Trustees
may grant the special permit provided in this chapter together with
any fair market compensation when it is determined, in its sole
discretion, that it is in the public interests and to do so would
minimize the hardship and unique impact of such taking upon the
property owner affected. [Added 12-17-2012 by L.L. No.

§ 200-82 VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 200-83
194:565
A. Legislative intent Economic and social changes, including changes in
lifestyles, which have occurred since the time that most homes in
Ardsley were built, have created a demand for significantly larger new
homes, as well as the teardown and redevelopment and/or major
expansion of existing homes. The Village Board hereby finds that the
scale of these new or expanded homes has, in some cases, been out of
character and scale with the neighborhoods in which they are located.
Similarly, a combination of larger houses and increased land utilization
for uses and structures accessory to such homes has caused excessive
disturbance of the land, increased stormwater runoff and resulted in a
reduction in green space, i.e., trees and other forms of vegetation. Such
intensive development and increased stormwater runoff results in
increased downstream flooding, erosion and sedimentation, as well as
impacting the aesthetically pleasing parklike character of the Village's
established neighborhoods. It is, therefore, the intent of the Village
Board, consistent with relevant economic and social considerations, to
establish reasonable controls on the size of new or expanded houses, as
well as on impervious surface coverage, but to do so in a way that
incorporates flexibility and good judgment into the process.
B. Maximum house size. The following table establishes the basic
permitted floor area for one-family dwellings on lots of the sizes
indicated, irrespective of zoning district, in the Village of Ardsley.
Notwithstanding these floor area standards, if any proposed dwelling is
located on a lot that has a lot area which exceeds the minimum lot area
requirements by more than 30%, such dwelling shall require Planning
Board special permit approval pursuant to the standards and
procedures as set forth in § 200-83D, unless such dwelling was made to
comply with the basic permitted floor area of a lot that does not exceed
the minimum lot area requirements by more than 30%. Further, the
Planning Board is hereby authorized, by special permit and also
pursuant to the standards and procedures as set forth in § 200-83D, to
allow an increase in the basic permitted floor area for any one-family
dwelling and its accessory buildings, not to exceed the maximum
amount as shown in the following table: [Amended 11-21-2005 by
L.L. No. 6-2005; 11-5-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007]

standards and procedures as set forth in § 200-83D, to allow an
increase in the basic permitted gross land coverage for one-family
dwelling lots, not to exceed the maximum amount as shown in the
following table. Further, in either case, an additional 10 square feet of
gross land coverage shall be permitted for each one foot of front yard

Planning Board shall, within a maximum of 30 days from the date of
the close of the public hearing unless such time period is extended
with the consent of the applicant, act either to approve, disapprove
or approve with required modifications any such special permit
application. Required modifications may include reduction in the
size of the proposed dwelling, its redesign or relocation on the site,
the redesign and/or relocation of any other proposed accessory
buildings, structures or uses on the site, the preservation of certain
site features, the provision of additional landscaping or other such
similar design changes. The Planning Board's decision with respect
to any such special permit application shall constitute a final
determination of the Planning Board. Aggrieved parties may seek
relief pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Laws and Rules of
the State of New York.
A. Reduced lot area. No lot shall be so reduced in area that any required
open space will be smaller than prescribed in the regulations for the
district in which said lot is located. Whenever such reduction in lot area
occurs, any building located on said lot shall not thereafter be used
until such building is altered, reconstructed or relocated so as to
comply with the area and yard requirements applicable thereto.
B. Visibility at intersections. On a corner lot in any residence district no
fence, wall, hedge or other similar structure or planting more than
three feet in height above established grade shall be erected, placed or
maintained within the triangular area formed by the intersecting street

§ 200-85. Yard requirements.
§ 200-86. Lots in two districts.
lines and a straight line joining said street lines at points which are 30
feet distant from the point of intersection, measured along said street
lines.
A. Terraces. A paved terrace shall not be considered as part of any
building in the determination of yard size or lot coverage; provided,
however, that such terrace is unroofed and without walls, parapets or
other form of enclosure. Such terrace, however, may have an open
guard railing not over three feet high and shall not project into any yard
to a point closer than four feet from any lot line.
B. Porches. Any porch or similar structure shall be considered a part of the
building in the determination of the size of yard or lot coverage.
C. Projecting architectural features. The space in any required yard shall
be open and unobstructed except for the ordinary projections of
window sills, belt courses, cornices, eaves and other architectural
features; provided, however, that such features shall not project more
than two feet into any required yard.
D. Fire escapes. Open fire escapes may extend into any required yard not
more than four feet, six inches.
E. Front yard depth. In any residence district, each dwelling hereafter
erected shall have a front yard at least equal in depth to the average
depth of the front yards of the lots adjacent thereto on either side, but
no front yard shall be less than 20 feet nor need any front yard have a
greater depth than 40 feet.
F. Reduction in rear yards. When a lot is less than 100 feet deep at the
time of the passage of this chapter, such rear yard may be decreased 1/
4 of the distance that the lot depth is less than said 100 feet; provided,
however, that no rear yard shall be less than 15 feet in depth.
A. District boundary. Where a district boundary line divides a lot in single
or joint ownership of record at the time such line is adopted, the Zoning
Board of Appeals may permit the extension of a use or structure into a
more restricted district immediately adjacent thereto when, and to the
extent that, it is evident that the portion of land in the more restricted
district is physically unsuited for the more restricted purpose, provided
that the lot has frontage on a street in the less restricted district, or if a
business lot extends from a business street to a residential street, all
business pedestrian or vehicular street access shall be from the
business street.
B. Business entrances on residential streets. Where a residential district is
bounded by a portion of a business district, then any side street
extending through such residential district into such business district
§ 200-84 ARDSLEY CODE § 200-86
194:570
§ 200-87. Side and rear yard transitions.
Where a lot in a business district abuts a lot in a residential district, there
shall be provided along such abutting lines a yard equal in width or depth
to that required in the residential district, and 10 feet shall be set aside
for ornamental plantings designed for concealment but not to exceed a
height necessary for concealment of the business structure. This provision
may be waived by the Zoning Board of Appeals if the business property is
topographically lower by the height of one story or more than the residential
area.
§ 200-88. Front yard transition.
Where the frontage on one side of a street between two intersecting streets
is zoned partly as residential and partly as business, the front yard depth in
the business district shall be equal to the required front yard depth of the
residential district.
§ 200-89. Corner lot transition.
On every corner lot in a residential district, there shall be provided on the
side street a side yard equal in depth to the required front yard depth on
the side street.
§ 200-90. Noncommercial livestock and poultry.
Only in an R-1 District shall there be permitted the keeping of livestock or
poultry, provided that:
§ 200-91. Street dedication. [Added 5-7-1962]
Whenever, after December 20, 1959, the owner or owners of any property
shall, while said property is located in a Residential District R-1, R-2 or
R-3, convey and dedicate to the Village of Ardsley, New York, any portion
thereof for use as a public highway or street, and such dedication shall be
completed without litigation and by the adoption by the Board of Trustees of
the Village of Ardsley, New York, of a resolution accepting such dedication,
which resolution provides expressly that the grantors shall suffer no
adverse effect under the Village of Ardsley, New York, Zoning Ordinance by
virtue of such dedication, then:
shall not be used for any business purposes, except as herein set forth.
The business structure erected in said business district shall face and
open upon the street set aside for business purposes, and an entrance
may be made at the corner of such business and residential streets, and
all other entrances thereto must face on the business street.
A. Livestock and poultry shall be adequately fenced on the property; and
B. No nuisance shall be created to any adjoining property owners.

§ 200-91.1. Adult entertainment uses. [Added 3-18-1996 by L.L. No.
1-1996]
The Board of Trustees hereby finds that adult entertainment uses of
property, by their very nature, have serious objectionable characteristics
which can have a significant impact on the neighborhood and community
in which they are located. The Board of Trustees further finds that: the
uncontrolled proliferation of such uses would be inconsistent with the
nature of the Village as a primarily residential, family-oriented community;
such uses can contribute to the blighting or downgrading of neighborhoods
in which they are located as a result of their related potential for an
increase in crime and the undermining of the economic, moral and social
welfare of the community; such uses can adversely impact the general
health, safety and economic well-being of the entire community and, in
particular, the children of the community; and the location of such uses in
areas where children reside or may regularly assemble is of great concern
to the Village of Ardsley. Therefore, it is the purpose of this section to
prevent a concentration of these uses in any one area and to specifically
reduce their potential accessibility to children.
A. The remaining contiguous property of such owner or owners shall not
be deemed nonconforming in any respect whatsoever, merely by virtue
of such dedication;
B. The owner or owners, and their successors in title, shall be entitled, in
applying the provisions of Article III, § 200-8, and/or § 200-9; Article IV,
§ 200-16, and/or § 200-17; Article V, § 200-24, and/or § 200-25, to have
the same applied as if the property so dedicated remained a portion of
the property owned by such owner or owners;
C. The conveyance and dedication shall not be deemed a reduction in area
for purposes of Article IX, § 200-84, of this chapter; and
D. The owner or owners, and their successors in title, shall be entitled, as
of right, to variances from the provisions of Article III, §§ 200-10 and
200-12; Article IV, §§ 200-18 and 200-20; Article V, §§ 200-26 and
200-28; and Article IX, § 200-85, without further showing of hardship,
to the extent deemed necessary and appropriate by the Zoning Board of
Appeals so as to avoid penalizing such owner or owners for such
dedication.

ARTICLE X
Environmental Protection
[Added 5-19-2003 by L.L. No. 4-2003]
§ 200-92. Legislative intent.
The Village Board of Trustees of the Village of Ardsley hereby finds and
declares it to be the public policy of the Village of Ardsley to preserve its
wetlands (including water bodies and watercourses), its steep slopes and its
trees, so as to protect both the environment and the aesthetic character of
the Village. The following specific purposes and findings are related to each
of these areas of environmental concern:
A. Wetlands.
(1) Population growth has produced increasing demands upon the
Village's land and natural resources. The resulting development is
encroaching upon, despoiling, polluting and/or eliminating some of
the Village's wetlands, water bodies, watercourses and other
natural resources, including the natural processes associated
therewith. The Village Board finds that it is necessary to preserve,
protect and conserve Ardsley's wetlands, including water bodies
and watercourses, so as to prevent their despoliation and
destruction, and to regulate the use and development thereof. The
preservation and maintenance of such natural features in an
undisturbed condition is important for physical, ecological, social,
aesthetic, recreational and economic reasons related to promoting
the health, safety and general welfare of present and future
residents of the Village, and of downstream drainage areas. In
particular, wetlands serve multiple functions, including, but not
limited to, the following:
(a) Protecting water resources by providing sources of surface
water, recharging groundwater and aquifers, serving as
chemical and biological oxidation basins and functioning as
settling basins for naturally occurring sedimentation.
(b) Controlling flooding and stormwater runoff by storing or
regulating natural flows.
(c) Providing nesting, migratory and wintering habitats for diverse
wildlife species, including many on the New York State and
federal Endangered Species lists.
(d) Supporting vegetative associations specifically adapted for
survival in low-oxygen environments.
(e) Providing areas of unusually high plant productivity which
support significant wildlife diversity and abundance.
(f) Providing breeding and spawning grounds, nursery habitat and
food for various species of fish.
§ 200-92 VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 200-92
194:579
(g) Serving as nutrient traps for nitrogen and phosphorus and
filters for surface water pollutants.
(h) Helping to maintain biospheric stability by supporting
particularly efficient photosynthesizers capable of producing
significant amounts of oxygen and supporting bacteria that
process excess nitrates and nitrogenous pollutants and return
them to the atmosphere as inert nitrogen gas.
(i) Providing open space and visual relief from development.
(j) Serving as outdoor laboratories and living classrooms for the
study and appreciation of natural history, ecology and biology.
(2) Some of these important natural resources have been lost or their
function impaired by having been drained, dredged, filled,
excavated, built upon, or polluted or by other actions which are
inconsistent with their proper protection. Remaining wetlands,
water bodies and watercourses are in similar jeopardy. It is the
intent of this article to promote the public purposes identified in
this section by providing for the protection, preservation, proper
maintenance and use of the Village's wetlands, water bodies and
watercourses; by preventing or minimizing erosion caused by
stormwater runoff and flooding; by maintaining natural
groundwater supplies; by preserving and protecting the purity,
utility, water retention capability, ecological functions, recreational
usefulness and natural beauty of all wetlands, water bodies,
watercourses and other related features of the terrain; and by
providing and protecting appropriate habitats for natural wildlife.
The avoidance or minimization of development on wetlands or
wetland buffers will also require appropriate adjustment of
development density to achieve the stated purpose.
B. Steep slopes.
(1) Population growth and increased land values have resulted in the
development of steep slope areas which were once considered to
be unbuildable or prohibitively expensive to develop. The Village
Board hereby finds that it is necessary to preserve, protect and
conserve Ardsley's steep slope areas so as to prevent their
unnecessary and improper disturbance with the resultant impact
which that may have upon the public health, safety and general
welfare. The preservation of such areas in an undisturbed condition
is important for physical, ecological, social, aesthetic, recreational
and economic reasons related to promoting and protecting the
health, safety and general welfare of present and future residents
of the Village and surrounding areas. The Village Board finds that it
is particularly important to preserve steep slopes for the following
reasons, among others:
(a) The improperly managed disturbance of steep slopes can cause
erosion and sedimentation to occur at rates in excess of those
§ 200-92 ARDSLEY CODE § 200-92
194:580
experienced under normal conditions. Erosion and
sedimentation often includes the loss of topsoil (a valuable
natural resource), and can result in the disturbance of natural
habitats, the degradation of the quality of surface water, the
alteration of drainage patterns, the gullying of land, the
obstruction of drainage structures and the intensification of
flooding, both on and off the subject site.
(b) The inadequately or uncontrolled disturbance of steep slopes
can lead to the failure of slopes and the mass movement of
earth which creates safety concerns for persons, wildlife and
man-made structures.
(c) Sleep slopes, including vegetation and rock outcroppings
located thereon, contribute to the attractive visual character of
the Village and surrounding areas since such slopes are more
highly visible from roadways and neighboring properties than
are more level lands.
(2) Regulation of development on steep slopes can eliminate, or at
least minimize, the degradation of these important environmental
features while still allowing the reasonable use of private property.
This can be done by encouraging flexible development design
which seeks to avoid the disturbance of steep slopes or, where that
is impractical, requires that any such disturbance be conducted in
accordance with acceptable engineering practices. The avoidance
or minimization of development on steep slope areas will also
require appropriate adjustment of development density to achieve
the stated purpose.
C. Trees. Population growth and changing lifestyles have resulted in
increasing demands for the clearance of trees to provide space for
various forms of human activity, including roadways, driveways,
parking areas, buildings, patios, decks, swimming pools, and other such
uses. The Village Board hereby finds that the preservation of trees is
necessary to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the
Village because trees provide shade, impede soil erosion, aid water
absorption and water retention in the soil, inhibit excess runoff and
flooding, enhance air quality, offer a natural barrier to noise and glare,
provide a natural habitat for wildlife, provide screening, enhance
property values and add to the general aesthetic quality of Ardsley. In
particular, trees benefit the community in the following specific ways,
among others:
(1) By providing shade and cooling the air, ground and buildings.
(2) By reducing wind, thereby resulting in greater energy efficiency for
the heating of buildings during winter.
(3) By reducing noise levels and glare.
(4) By reducing soil erosion, especially on slopes.
§ 200-92 VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 200-92
194:581
§ 200-93. Regulations.
The regulations established in this section shall apply to any proposed
regulated activity affecting wetlands, watercourses, water bodies, steep
slopes and trees in the Village of Ardsley, as defined in § 200-2, for which a
permit or other final development approval has not been issued prior to the
effective date of these regulations.
(5) By reducing stormwater runoff and the possibility of flooding.
(6) By balancing the oxygen in the air by removing carbon dioxide.
(7) By reducing air, soil and water pollution.
(8) By providing habitat for wildlife.
(9) By buffering views of man-made structures, thereby helping to
maintain the attractive character of the Village.
(10) By enhancing property values.
A. Regulated activities. The following are regulated activities with regard
to the respective environmental features, as set forth below:
(1) Wetlands, water bodies and watercourses. Within any wetland,
water body or watercourse, and within a twenty-five-foot horizontal
buffer area thereof, none of the following activities shall be
permitted without a permit from the Village of Ardsley Planning
Board pursuant to the standards, procedures and requirements of
§ 200-93C hereof:

§ 200-96. Board established. [Amended 12-5-88 by L.L. No. 6-1988]
A Zoning Board of Appeals is hereby established in accordance with the
Village Law. The words "the Board," when used in this article, refer to said
Board. The Board shall consist of five members appointed by the Village
Board. Appointments shall be for a five-year term. The Chairman of the
Board shall be designated by the Village Board each year and shall serve
as such Chairman for one year pursuant to each such designation. The
Board shall serve without compensation. The Board shall, consistent with
the Village Law, determine its own rules, forms and procedure, and all its
deliberations, resolutions and orders shall be in accordance therewith.
§ 200-97. Powers and duties.
The Board shall have all the powers and duties prescribed or permitted by
law and/or by this chapter, which are more particularly specified as follows;
provided, however, that none of the following provisions shall be deemed
to limit any power conferred upon the Board by law or elsewhere in this
chapter:
A. Interpretation. Upon appeal from any decision, determination, order or
requirement by an administrative official or upon the request of any
official or board of the Village, to decide any question involving the
interpretation of any provision of this chapter, including determination
of the exact location of any district boundaries if there is uncertainty
with respect thereto.
B. Variances. Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this chapter, the
Board shall have the power, in passing upon appeals from orders,
requirements, determinations or decisions made pursuant to this
chapter by the Superintendent of Buildings (or any of his assistants,
inspectors or subordinates to whom he has delegated final authority to
make such orders, requirements and determinations, if any, which he
has been authorized by the Village Board so to delegate) or upon a
direct application to the Board in any case where the Board, by rule or
uniform policy, permits such application, to vary or modify the
application of any of the regulations or provisions of this chapter
relating to the use, construction or alteration of buildings or structures
or the use of land so that the spirit of the chapter shall be observed,
public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. No
variance from the strict application of any provision of this chapter shall
be granted by the Board unless it finds that:
(1) There are special circumstances or conditions, fully described in
the findings, applying to the land or building for which the variance
is sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such
land or buildings and do not apply generally to land or buildings in
§ 200-96 VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 200-97
194:591
the neighborhood, do not result from any act of the appellant
or applicant or his or its predecessors in interest subsequent to
the adoption of this chapter or subsequent to the adoption or
purported adoption of any prior Zoning Ordinance or purported
Zoning Ordinance or amendment or purported amendment thereto,
if such act when done or performed was contrary to the terms
or provisions of such prior ordinance, purported ordinance,
amendment or purported amendment then actually or purportedly
in force, and that said circumstances or conditions are such that
the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive
the applicant or appellant of the reasonable use of such land or
building;
(2) For reasons fully set forth in the findings, the granting of the
variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building
and that the variance as granted by the Board is the minimum
variance that will accomplish this purpose; and
(3) The granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. In
granting any variance, the Board shall prescribe any conditions
that it deems to be necessary or desirable in the public interest,
and such determination or reference thereto shall be recorded
upon the building permit or certificate of occupancy issued
pursuant thereto.
(4) The time limitation for zoning variances is established for the
period of one year. [Added 12-5-88 by L.L. No. 6-1988]
C. Special variances, uses, exceptions and permits. Upon appeal from any
decision by an administrative official, which decision is adverse to the
appellant because a special variance or permit in the discretion of the
Board is required by the provisions of this chapter for the result or
relief requested, to issue variances for any of the uses for which this
chapter requires the obtaining of such variance from the Board or for
the extension of a building or use as such lawfully existed at the time of
the passage of this chapter into a contiguous more restricted district for
a distance not exceeding 10 feet, but not for any other use or purpose;
and to direct the issuance of a permit and to specify the terms and
conditions upon which the same shall be issued in any case made
subject to the consent, approval or permission of the Board by the
provisions of this chapter. No such variance or permit shall be granted
by the Board unless it finds that the use for which the same is sought
will not, in the circumstances of the particular case and under any
conditions that the Board considers to be necessary or desirable, be
injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public
welfare. In addition, as a prerequisite to the approval of any special
permit application, the following general findings shall be made:
[Amended 12-17-1990 by L.L. No. 16-1990]

and vehicular traffic from public streets and sidewalks, so as to
assure the public safety and to avoid traffic congestion, and further
that vehicular entrances and exits shall be clearly visible from

character or integrity of any land use within the immediate
neighborhood having unique cultural, historical, geographical,
architectural or other special characteristics.

194:596
Buildings, and any violation of any such order and any failure to comply
therewith within any reasonable time for compliance therein set forth
shall constitute a violation of this chapter. If the Board finds as a fact
that the thing done without the requisite permission was done in good
faith and in an honest belief that the person doing the same was entitled
to do the same, the Board shall set forth such finding in its decision;
in any such case where the permission is nevertheless denied and an
order issued requiring the modification or removal of any structure or
the undoing of any thing, the Board shall require only the minimum
modification, removal or undoing which the Board deems necessary to
effectuate the purposes of this chapter and shall state in its decision
that the requirements in its order contained are such minimum. Where
the Board does not find such fact, it may require such modification,
removal or undoing as it deems appropriate under all the circumstances
to effectuate the purposes of this chapter and the policies of the Board
not inconsistent therewith.
H. The Board shall cause minutes to be kept of all its official meetings and
public hearings, such minutes to be placed in a separate minute book
maintained in the office of the Village Clerk, but no minutes need be
kept of any informal meeting with an applicant or appellant prior to the
public hearing upon his or its application or appeal. Any decision or
determination of the Board shall be made only at an official meeting.
Minutes of a meeting shall contain the substance of such discussions or
deliberations as the Board or any member thereof may determine, but
shall contain the complete findings of fact, conclusions, decisions and
determinations made or reached, the names of the members of the
Board present and each vote of each member of the Board; and minutes
of a public hearing shall contain a transcript of the hearing, the names
and addresses of the representative of the applicant or appellant and of
any Village official or board, and the name and address of each person
who speaks at the hearing, provided that when any document is
annexed to the minutes or permanently filed with any officer or board of
the Village or with the Board, and such document is read in whole or in
part at such hearing or meeting, it shall be sufficient to identify such
document and incorporate the same by reference and indicate the
portion or portions thereof so read. A certified copy of any such minutes
or of any portion thereof shall be supplied by the Village Clerk within 15
days after request to any person upon payment to the Village Clerk, at
the time of such request, of a fee of $0.20 for each 100 words or major
fraction thereof but not less than $1 per copy.
I. Whenever the Board shall desire the attendance of the Superintendent
of Buildings or of any officer of the Building Department at a public
hearing, the Board shall cause a copy of the notice thereof as published
or as to be published to be sent or delivered to such Superintendent or
other officer personally or by registered or certified mail at least 10
days in advance of the date of such hearing, and such Superintendent
or other officer shall thereupon either attend such hearing or advise the

Board at the earliest date and time possible under the circumstances of
his inability to attend and of the reasons therefor.
J. Subpoenas requiring the attendance of any witness before the Board
and subpoenas duces tecum requiring the production before the Board
of any books, records, documents or other tangible objects, may be
issued by and in the name of the Chairman or Acting Chairman of the
Board, upon their own motion, upon the request of any applicant or
appellant, upon the request of any member of the Board or upon the
request of any official or board of the Village. All such subpoenas and
subpoenas duces tecum shall be in form substantially similar to those
used in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, and service thereof
shall be made in the same manner and shall be accompanied by tender
of the same witness fees and mileage fees as are applicable in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York.
A. Every exercise of any discretion conferred by this chapter shall be
guided by the principles and purposes of zoning as provided in the law
of the State of New York, by the principles of due process and equal
protection of the law, by the basic concepts of nondiscriminatory
treatment of persons similarly situated and fairness, both to the
individual and the residents of the Village as a whole, and by the
purposes of this chapter.
B. Except as otherwise expressly provided, every exercise of any
discretion conferred by this chapter shall be based upon consideration
of the following standards:
(1) Protection of the individual from unnecessary and non-self-imposed
hardships.
(2) Protection of the character of the Village and of the various
sections and areas thereof.
(3) Protection of the property values of the individual, the residents of
the Village as a whole and the residents of the various sections and
areas thereof; and, in case of conflict, equitable balancing of such
interests.
(4) Protection of the residents of the Village and of the various sections
and areas thereof against nuisance and hazard of any and every
kind and against unreasonable and undue interference with their
peace, quiet, enjoyment, safety or general welfare.

Jersey Area, as published by the United States Bureau of Labor
Statistics (the "Index") on any date between the month that was
two months earlier than the month in which the seller contracts to
sell the unit. If the Bureau stops publishing this index, the Village
designates a substitute index; and
(2) The cost of major capital improvements made by the seller of the
unit while said seller owned the unit, as evidenced by paid receipts
depreciated on a straight-line basis over a fifteen-year period from

income should subsequently exceed the maximum then allowable, as
defined in this article, then the renter may complete his/her current
lease term and shall be offered a nonrestricted rental unit in the
development, if available, at the end of such lease term. If no such unit
is available at said time, the renter may be allowed to sign one
additional one-year lease for the fair and affordable housing unit s/he
occupies but shall not be offered a renewal of the lease beyond the
expiration of that additional one-year lease term. If, however, at the end
of the additional one-year term the renter's income is below the
maximum then allowable, the renter shall be offered a two-year
renewable lease.

meeting to the greatest extent possible during the review
and approval process, subject to the demonstrated cooperation of the
applicant to adhere to same. Should the approval process extend
beyond one year, an applicant for a development including fair and
affordable housing units shall be entitled to at least one additional

staff to review any and all items discussed at previous pre-application
