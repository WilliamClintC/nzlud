SECTION 7.07 | LIGHTING PLAN
A. Fully Shielded Lights. All lights exceeding ten (10’) feet in height as measured from grade directly below the fixture to the top of the fixture shall be fully shielded lights that do not emit light rays at angles above the horizontal plane as certified by a photometric test report.
B. Light Level Measurement. Lighting shall not exceed six (6) foot candles as measured at ground level, except gasoline service station pumps, and drive-thru’s may be permitted to have lighting not in excess of ten (10) foot candles, provided the lighting is concentrated for safety and security purposes and not allowed across an entire site or to spill onto adjacent areas.
C. Light Levels at Property Line. The maximum illumination at the property line shall not exceed one-half (0.5) foot candles. No direct light source shall be visible at the property line (adjacent to residential) at ground level, additional house side shielding may be required where light sources are visible.
D. Zoning Commission Modifications. The Zoning Commission, as applicable, may modify these levels or place conditions on their application (e.g., the installation of screening such as an open buffer, landscaping, wall, or fence) if such modifications are deemed necessary and appropriate for the use and surrounding area.
E. Uniform Illumination Levels. Outdoor lighting shall be designed to achieve uniform illumination levels. The ratio of the average light level of the surface being lit to the lowest light level of the surface being lit, measured in foot-candles, shall not exceed a ratio of 4-to-1. In no case shall the maximum to minimum light levels exceed a ratio of 10-to-1 between any 2 points on a lot.
F. Color Temperature of Lighting. Lighting utilized for street or parking lot lighting shall not have a correlated color temperature exceeding three thousand kelvin (3,000K). Security lighting such as at an ATM or drive thru may be permitted by the Zoning Commission to exceed three thousand kelvin (3,000K).
G. Light Pole Height. Light fixtures mounted on poles (i.e. site lighting as opposed to building wall packs and architectural lighting mounted to a building façade) shall not exceed twenty-five (25’) feet above grade for lighting in residential districts and for uses adjacent to a residential district or use nor thirty-five (35’) feet for all other districts. In no case shall lights be mounted in excess of the maximum height limitation of the district in which they are located.

concrete bases are prohibited.
1. Existing sites (i.e. a site with an existing primary structure and parking area lighting) outside of the AC-1 through AC-5 Zoning Districts may be permitted to utilize elevated concrete bases, projecting no more than thirty-six (36”) inches above grade, during replacement or renovation of parking area lighting where owing to the existing conditions of the site and or public safety considerations it is the determination of the Zoning Commission that it is not practical to eliminate the use of elevated bases.
2. Such uses shall be minimized to areas where due to the location of existing landscape islands or other features it is not possible to locate a light in such feature and still maintain compliance with the photometric requirements of the site without adding additional lighting.
3. Light poles located in landscape areas shall be flush with the ground or on a poured concrete foundation extending no more than three (3”) inches above grade.
I. Wall Pack Placement. Wall packs designed and utilized for security and safety purposes must be fully shielded to direct the light downward. They shall not be used to draw attention to the building or to provide general building or site lighting.
J. Canopy Mounted Lighting. Light fixtures mounted on canopies shall be recessed or flush with the bottom of the canopy. Where a drop-down fixture is used, the lens shall be flush with (i.e., no more than one inch beyond) the casing so that light is directed down and not sideways. All canopy lighting shall be shielded to provide a cut-off angle of 85 degrees. Fixtures shall not be mounted on the top or sides of canopies. The illumination of canopy sides shall be prohibited.
K. Glare Reduction. Glare control shall be accomplished primarily through the proper selection and application of lighting equipment. Only after those means have been exhausted shall landscaping, fencing and similar screening methods be considered acceptable means for reducing glare.
L. Security Lighting. Lighting for security purposes shall be directed only onto the area to be secured:
1. All fixtures shall be located, shielded and aimed so that light is not cast toward adjacent properties or streets or unnecessarily transmitted into the night sky.
2. Fixtures mounted on the building and designed to illuminate the facade are preferred.
M. Exceptions to Light Levels. The illumination of vehicle fueling stations, drive

E. Yard and Bulk Requirements.
It is desirable to establish setback requirements to maintain consistency in building placement along major thoroughfares. Building height and bulk should be the highest adjacent to the interchange and decline gradually as the distance away from the interchange increases.
1. Front yard setback. A minimum front yard setback of 60 feet is required for buildings with frontage on Byers Road, Miamisburg-Springboro Pike, and State Route 741. This setback is sufficient to provide the required area for tree preservation zones or landscaped buffer yards next to road rights-of-way as required under Section 2710.G.2. The front yard setback may be reduced to 30 feet if parking is not located between the building and the road right-of-way. A minimum front yard setback of 30 feet is required for all buildings located adjacent to other public roads.
2. Side yard setback. Side yard setbacks shall be the minimum required to accommodate required buffer yard widths pursuant to Section 2710.G.3 below. A zero foot setback is permissible with a common building wall.
3. Rear yard setbacks shall be the minimum required to accommodate required buffer yard widths pursuant to Subsection D below.
4. Setback from Residential Districts. All nonresidential uses and associated parking lots and loading facilities shall be located not less than seventy-five (75) feet from land zoned for residential purposes.
5. Coverage and Open Space Requirements. Not more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the area of any development lot or development parcel shall be covered with any combination of buildings, pavement, or other impervious surfaces. Detention ponds, retention ponds, wetlands and floodplains shall not account for more than 50% of the required 25% open space area. Exceptions can be made to the 50% restriction by the Zoning Commission if extraordinary efforts are proposed to make such areas a positive site amenity by incorporating trails and pedestrian furniture and lighting around and/or through such areas.
6. Maximum Building Height. Buildings located adjacent to I-75 or within 500 feet of the Miamisburg Springboro pike overpass at I-75 shall not exceed 8 stories in height. Buildings located between 500 and 1,500 feet from the
Miamisburg Springboro pike overpass at I-75 shall not exceed six stories. All other buildings shall not exceed 4 stories in height.
7. Minimum Building Height. Multi-story structures are required within a 1,000 foot radius from the center of the Miamisburg-Springboro Pike overpass at I-75 to
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION

create a pronounced gateway at the Austin Center Interchange.
8. Maximum Lot Coverage. The maximum building coverage shall not exceed 50% of the lot area except when a parking garage is proposed. In such case, the maximum lot coverage shall not exceed 75% of the lot area.
F. Landscaping Standards.
Landscaping has a significant impact on the quality of the environment. In addition to visual appeal, landscaping provides an essential buffer and screen for undesirable features such as parking lots and utility structures. The standards of Article 45-A shall apply, except as specifically modified below:
1. General Requirements. As a general guideline, a consistent landscape program is required throughout Austin Center including a mix of evergreen trees, canopy trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, and flowering ground covers to provide an inviting environment.
2. Landscaping Adjacent to Rights-of-Way. Landscape buffer yards shall be provided adjacent to the Byers Road, Miamisburg-Springboro Pike, Austin Road, SR 741 and I-75 rights-of-way planted with a mixture of shade trees, ornamental trees, bushes and ground cover as required in the below table. A minimum screen height is established to screen parking lots and commercial uses from rights-of-way. Earth mounds, decorative masonry walls, and dense vegetation can be used in any combination to provide the required screening.

4. Parking Lot Interior.
A continuous landscape island should be provided between every fourth double row of parking or, alternatively, at the ends of each parking aisle and between every twelve (12) parking spaces. Trees shall be planted at locations protected from vehicular encroachment. Landscape islands shall be designed to separate parking aisles, direct traffic, and break large expanses of asphalt. The width and area of each landscape island shall be sufficient to protect trees from vehicular encroachment. Each island shall contain shrubs, ground cover and/or mulch at least one required deciduous tree for every 500 square feet of landscape island.
5. The Zoning Director or Zoning Commission may grant modifications to any buffer yard landscaping requirement where existing or proposed vegetation meets the intent of these regulations, or when, because of the unique shape, location, or character of the property, alternative landscaping requirements would produce a more appealing landscape design. However, additional tree plantings or other landscape elements may be required where existing vegetation is sparse and/or the intent of these regulations is not met. Existing plant material used in lieu of the above buffer yard requirements shall be protected by a perpetual

conservation easement.
G. Planting Standards. The following guidelines shall be followed:
1. The plant palette should emphasize native trees, shrubs, and ground cover that are hardy to this region.
2. Deciduous trees shall have a DBH (diameter at breast height) of at least 2.5 inches; Ornamental trees shall have a DBH of at least 2.0 inches and evergreen trees shall be at least six feet high at the time of planting. Deciduous and evergreen shrubs shall be a minimum of 18 inches high at the time of planting with no fewer than 6 main branches.
3. Plants shall be salt-spray tolerant, compatible with existing soil conditions and tolerant of a wide range of conditions.
4. Creativity in landscape design is encouraged. The planting design shall use massing or groupings of materials to create a stronger visual impact for high speed areas, use plant diversity for long term health of the plants, use repetition for continuity and create visual interest by incorporating spring and summer flowers and fall color. The design shall incorporate the Zoning Director’s or Zoning Commission’s desired visual effect and, equally important, the intent of the Township to coordinate landscaping on adjoining properties.
5. New landscaping should be naturalistic looking by being sensitive to Austin Center’s existing natural features. New landscaping should blend with existing vegetation and topography. Earth mounds should undulate horizontally and vertically to remove monotony from the landscape and to look as naturalistic as possible.
6. Plants shall not be located where they might interfere with overhead utilities or block visibility for pedestrians and motorists.
H. Screening Standards. Proper placement of utilitarian features enhances the effectiveness of screening. Ground and roof mounted mechanical equipment, trash receptacles, and loading areas shall be screened from view from any public right-of-way or adjacent property through the use of evergreen plantings or enclosures or roof form.
I. Trash receptacles shall be screened on three (3) sides with durable building materials consistent with the colors and materials used on the façade of the principal building. The fourth side shall be screened with a decorative opaque gate with a lockable latch assembly. Bollards shall be provided to protect adjacent vehicles from gate over-swing.
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 27 – AUSTIN CENTER DISTRICTS
Revised: November, 2006 – Res. 242-2006 27 - 21
J. Signs. Consistent business signage is necessary for ease of way finding and visual continuity. Low profile monument signs, rather than pole or pylon signs, shall be used throughout the Austin Center District. Such signs should be integrated into the overall site design, consistent in architectural style with the building it advertises. Article 41 Sign Regulations, shall control the specific sign requirements and prohibitions. Office uses shall follow the standards of Section 4105, and retail and industrial uses shall follow the standards of Section 4106,with the following additional provisions:
1. Prohibited Signs. Roof signs, pole signs, pylon signs, billboards, and highway signs are prohibited.
2. Ground Sign Requirements. Ground signs shall be monument signs such as no support structures are visible. The sign base shall be constructed of the same materials as the building facade, and the sign style shall be consistent with the architecture of the building it advertises. Landscaping consisting of shrubs, flowers, and accent stones shall be provided around the base of all monument signs. Ground lighting should be flush with the grade or obscured by landscaping. Internally illuminated ground signs are discouraged.
K. Parking and Loading. Article 42 Off-street Loading Regulations and Article 43 Off-street Parking Regulations shall govern in addition to the following provisions.
1. Permitted Parking Lot Locations. Not more than two rows of parking shall be placed in any front yard of an office and/or industrial development and not more than one row of parking shall be placed in any front yard of a retail development. For the purpose of determining the permitted location of parking lots any yard located adjacent to a road right of way shall be considered a front yard. Parking lots located in front and side yards shall be screened in accordance with subsection (D).
2. Shared Parking Lots. Parking lots located on adjacent properties shall be connected by access aisles. Access easements shall be shown on Development Plans and recorded at Montgomery County. The number of required parking spaces may be reduced if shared parking is provided in conjunction with uses that have different peak hour parking demand.
3. Pedestrian Circulation. A safe transition shall be provided for people walking from their vehicles to the building, or for pedestrians or bicyclists using a public pathway to the building entrance. The design of the parking lot should minimize areas where vehicular traffic moves in the same space with pedestrians. Walkways shall be curbed and elevated higher than parking lots to place pedestrians at a higher level than vehicular traffic.
4. Loading Bays. Loading bays shall not face I-75, Miamisburg Springboro Pike,
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 27 – AUSTIN CENTER DISTRICTS
Revised: November, 2006 – Res. 242-2006 27 - 22
or SR 741 or be visible from any other right-of-way or residential district. Loading areas shall be screened from view from local streets and residential districts by an opaque barrier consisting of a decorative screen wall consistent in appearance and materials with that of the principal building, continuous evergreen planting, or some combination thereof.
5. Bicycle Parking. Bicycle parking should be provided next to building entrances or at safe and convenient locations within parking lots.
L. Pedestrian Amenities/Circulation. Each development shall provide at least one centrally located and well defined pedestrian space. Examples of pedestrian spaces include plazas, patios, and courtyards. Pedestrian spaces shall be located at logical destinations and be anchored by special design features and site furniture such as decorative towers, arcades, porticos, pedestrian scale light fixtures, bollards, art, water features, planting walls, and other elements that define the pedestrian realm. Pedestrian spaces located in isolated areas, located away from buildings, or are sparse with amenities, will not meet the requirements of this section.
M. Pathways. Pathways (i.e., bike paths and shared use trails) and/or sidewalks shall extend into each site development from the existing or planned Austin Center bike path and sidewalk system. The intent is to offer a range of non-motorized commuting and recreational options for employees, residents and visitors of the area. The Zoning Commission may reduce the number of off-street parking spaces required for the provision of bicycle parking facilities and a well designed non-motorized circulation system on-site that:
1. Links buildings and main entrances to the public sidewalk system and multi-use paths.
2. Connects office and industrial buildings to nearby common areas, open spaces, plazas, courtyards, and retail areas.
3. Establishes pedestrian connections between employment centers and adjacent neighborhoods.
SECTION 2714 | MODIFICATIONS.

ARTICLE 31 | PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
SECTION 3101 | PURPOSE.
This Chapter is intended to describe the procedures for placement of parcels into either one of the previously established Planned Development Districts listed within this Resolution, as authorized and pursuant to Ohio Revised Code (ORC) Section 519.021(A) or into a new Planned-Unit Development, simultaneously adopting regulations that will apply only to that Planned-Unit Development as authorized and pursuant to ORC Section 519.021(B), and the standards by which these districts must adhere. Such districts are to be permitted as amendments to the Zoning Map, on application and approval of specific and detailed plans where tracts suitable in location and character for the uses and structures proposed are to be planned and developed as units. Regulations set forth herein are adapted to unified planning and development in such districts. Applications for Planned Development rezoning will be granted only when the plan for the project is such that the public health, safety and morals will not be jeopardized by a departure from the restrictions on corresponding uses in the standard zoning district. The Planned Development shall further the purpose of promoting the general public welfare.
SECTION 3102 | GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
A. Application of Standards.
All Planned Developments, whether utilizing the provisions of Articles 32 through 35-A or through the establishment of a new Planned Unit Development pursuant to ORC, Section 519.021 (B), shall require adherence to quality landscaping, lighting, parking and other general standards of Miami Township while providing flexibility to encourage innovation in the planning and building of developments.
In addition to the listed development standards and provisions for the applicable Planned Development District, each Final Development Plan shall adhere to the standards listed below:
1. Article 7: The Building Design and Lighting standards of Article 7 shall apply to commercial buildings and sites, including apartment complexes, as permitted for any PD-1 through PD-5 District, with all other residential buildings, i.e. single-family homes and similar structures, adhering to the approved elevation plans. Site design, screening and other criteria shall be based upon the landscaping requirements and individual provisions of the applicable Planned Development District;
2. Article 38: Accessory uses;
3. Article 41: Sign regulations;
4. Article 42 and Article 43: Parking and loading regulations;
5. Article 44: Noise regulations;
6. Article 45-A: Landscaping regulations;
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 31 – PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
Revised: October, 2019 – Res. 060-2019 31 - 2
The Board of Trustees may waive specific elements of an individual standard and such waiver shall be documented either through the approval of a specific alternative standard or a clearly approved plan noting any such approved deviations from the standards of each Article listed above.
It is also recognized that individual Final Development Plans may meet certain criteria through cross guarantees and approvals of adjacent Final Development Plans that are part of the same overall Preliminary Development Plan and such approval of an individual plan on this basis shall be documented and noted in the standards and requirements for each respective Final Development Plan.
B. Existing Planned Developments.
Existing plans which are subsequently modified and do not have an otherwise adopted set of development standards granting a waiver from the provisions of the Articles noted above, shall be subject to the current standards of each article unless approved for such waiver by the Board of Trustees. In the absence of a clear adjustment to a written standard or clearly denoted waiver noted on an approved Final Development Plan, the standards of each article shall apply.
C. Planned-Unit Developments.
In addition to utilizing the existing Planned Development Districts established under this Resolution, the Board of Township Trustees may, upon application of the property owners, establish a new Planned-Unit Development pursuant to ORC Section 519.021 (B) and simultaneously adopt regulations that will apply only to the new Planned-Unit Development.
1. Planned-Unit Developments adopted under these procedures shall be listed below and/or in an appendix to this Resolution by case number along with the respective adopted planned-unit development regulations for that case, until such time as the applicable tract of land is zoned into another zoning designation.
2. Planned Unit-Developments created under the provisions of ORC Section 519.021(B) and adopted after the effective date of this Resolution as amended, shall be given a Special Purpose Planned-Unit Development “SP-PUD” or Special Purpose Master Planned Unit Development “SP-MPUD” designation as applicable on the zoning map.
3. In each case, the architectural, landscaping, lighting and other development standards of this resolution shall be utilized as a basis for development of the SP-PUD and SP-MPUD standards but may be modified as approved under the final PUD standards for each project.

The role of the Master Developer shall be clearly outlined in the covenants and restrictions for the project. Applications for new development or modifications to existing development within the designated MPUD submitted to Miami Township shall be accompanied by a letter from the Master Developer indicating that they have reviewed the proposed plans and approve of said plans, disapprove or recommend specific adjustments. Absent a letter of approval from the Master Developer, the applicant may submit evidence via record of certified mail that the applicant provided said plans to the Master Developer at least ten (10) days prior to submittal to Miami Township. Miami Township retains authority in making a final determination regarding compliance with the standards of this resolution and associated development standards.

MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 31 – PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
Revised: October, 2019 – Res. 060-2019 31 - 17
Modifications may be initiated by one or more of the property owners within a Planned Development District. A completed application and plan following the standards and requirements for a Preliminary, Final or Master Planned Unit Development Plan application respectively, together with any applicable fees, shall be submitted.
Master Planned Unit Developments shall follow the criteria prescribed under the Master Planned Unit Development regulations for a specific project, but shall follow the criteria below if no such criteria were prescribed.
A. Administrative Minor Modifications
1. Minor modifications to an approved Preliminary, Final, or Master Planned Unit Development plan which become necessary due to field conditions, detailed engineering data, fire and or other life safety requirements, utility conflicts, topography, general changes requested by one or more of the owners, or critical design criteria may be authorized by the Director of Community Development and/or his/her designee (Staff) or successor with the concurrence of the Township Administrator on behalf of the Board of Trustees. In the event the Township Administrator is absent, the Acting Township Administrator, Assistant Township Administrator or the President of the Board of Trustees may offer a concurring signature.
2. Minor Modifications are characterized as minor adjustments to approved features and buildings that comply with the standards of the particular planned development in which they are located. Minor adjustments include but are not limited to the following features:
a. Driveway locations (not including the addition or removal of driveways);
b. Curb cuts;
c. Pedestrian walkways;
d. Retaining walls;
e. Utilities and related equipment or structure;

MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 31 – PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
Revised: October, 2019 – Res. 060-2019 31 - 18
3. Minor modifications shall be guided by the following standards, shall not alter the general intent or character of the approved planned development and shall not:
a. Modify an element that is described as a Major Modification or an Amendment to the Planned Development Regulations;
b. Increase the density of residential units;
c. Decrease the number of parking spaces below that required by Article 43 or increase the square footage of buildings to the point that the parking standards are not met;
d. Modify the overall street layout beyond minor adjustments in alignment due to field conditions or safety requirements;
e. Generally decrease the amount of landscaping provided, without appropriate substitutions based upon either the approved landscape standards or the standards of Article 45-A or reduce required landscape buffers between office/commercial/industrial areas and adjoining residentially zoned districts;
f. Modify signage standards in a manner that would violate the general spirit and intent of the sign regulations of Article 41 and provided sign standards are adjusted as part of a comprehensive sign package for a building or site. Sign packages shall emphasize low profile signage that complements the architectural style of a site or building and promotes a pedestrian friendly environment but may vary from the standards of Article 41 in order to accommodate the particular layout of a master planned development and associated structures. Modifications to sign standards shall be based upon the placement, manner, duration, and area of sign displays rather than the content of proposed signage; however, staff may specify the ability to display commercial versus non-commercial messages on specific types of signage. Staff may also require that a more comprehensive set of buildings or standards be included as part of any sign modification request in order to provide consistency throughout the planned development. The sign standards of Article 41 and any adopted standards that are part of an approved preliminary or final development plan shall continue to apply, except as specifically modified through this process.
4. Staff may require such substitutions or adjustments in other site elements as necessary to mitigate any proposed modifications. All approved modifications shall be reported to the Zoning Commission and Board of Trustees within sixty (60) days. A completed application form and such other information as required by Miami Township shall accompany all applications.
5. An Administrative Review for minor modifications may be appealed to the Board
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 31 – PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
Revised: October, 2019 – Res. 060-2019 31 - 19

All decisions of the staff may also be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals following the procedures for an Administrative Appeal under Article 4.
6. Applications for minor modifications may be reviewed concurrently as part of an application for zoning certificate. Fees shall be paid per the fee schedule.
7. Administrative reviews shall occur within fourteen (14) business days of receiving all necessary materials. If such review does not occur within fourteen (14) business days and no further materials have been requested by staff, the applicant may submit said application directly to the Board of Trustees to be heard at the next regularly scheduled meeting. Staff may extend a review period up to fourteen (14) additional business days upon submittal to the applicant of a written letter detailing the need for such extension, i.e. for additional fire, traffic, or other regulatory review. At the end of the initial fourteen (14)-day review period or such permitted extension, staff shall either approve or deny said application.
B. Modifications to residential units within an approved planned development.
The Director of Community Development and/or his/her designee may approve, upon application for a zoning certificate, modifications to single family residences within an approved planned development provided such modifications are limited to those which:
1. Comply with the setback requirements established for the planned unit development
2. Involve the addition or alteration of accessory uses within non-common areas of a single-family residential planned development and comply with the provisions of Article 38 and such other provisions as specified by the final development plan.

1. Major Modifications shall be characterized by the following:
a. Modifications that involve the relocation of approved buildings and other large features, beyond minor adjustments, as shown on the preliminary or final site plan(s) in compliance with the overall setback, density, or other similar standards of the development while adhering to the general spirit and intent of the approved preliminary or final development plans;
b. Increasing the size, general location, or placement of detention/retention basins outside of designated retention/detention basin areas or closer to perimeter property lines if no such areas are designated on the approved plans, beyond minor adjustments necessary due to specific field conditions;
c. A change in the number of lots or size of the phasing plan within the planned development, provided such change does not require adjustment of an approved density standard;
d.

This allowance does not include amendments to approved design standards, such as a series of model home designs.
2. The items to be provided or shown on the application and plans may be modified by Miami Township as noted on the official and current Miami Township application form for a Major Modification.

c. The Zoning Commission shall have authority to render a final decision on Major Modifications as these are intended to be modifications that are in keeping with the general spirit and intent of the original plan approvals and standards for the development.
d. The Zoning Commission shall within thirty (30) days following the close of the public hearing either approve, approve with modifications, or deny the Major Modification.
e. The approval of a Major Modification does not exempt the owner from obtaining any required new or revised zoning certificates and such other approvals as may be required by Miami Township or other authorities.
D. Planned Development Regulation Amendments.
Amendments to the adopted standards of a Planned Development shall be noticed and heard at a public hearing in the manner prescribed for zoning map amendments under Article 6 of this Resolution and upon payment of applicable fees and submission of an application by one or more of the property owners within the affected Planned Development.

In addition to the provisions of Article 31, Section 3102, General Development Standards, the Final Development Plan must comply with the following:
32-A04.01 MINIMUM PROJECT SIZE.
The minimum gross area of a tract of land proposed for an open space residential subdivision in the Planned Agriculture District shall be twenty (20) acres. The area proposed shall be in single ownership or, if in multiple ownership, all the owners of the included properties shall jointly file the application.
Parcels less than twenty (20) acres in size may be subdivided subject to the restrictions of Article 8, Section 803 of the Miami Township Zoning Resolution.
32-A04.02 MINIMUM LOT AREA.
The minimum lot area shall be determined by whether the development is a conventional, non-clustered development layout or a clustered development layout. The total number of housing units permitted in a development is limited in the manner defined in Section 32-AO4.03 below. For this determination, all dwelling units must also comply with the spacing and yard requirements defined in Section 32-A04.04 below.
A. Conventional, Non-clustered Development. The minimum lot area
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 32-A – “PD-A” PLANNED AGRICULTURE DISTRICT
Adopted: November 1972 32-A - 3
for a conventional, non-clustered development layout in the PD-A District shall be five (5) acres. Areas within a non-clustered development lot that would be completely undevelopable by virtue of public or private easements, or physical limitations such as steep slopes, water features, wetlands, or other existing environmental constraints to development shall not be included in calculating the size of a lot. Some lots may result in being larger than the required minimum lot size due to the size and shape of the site.
B. Clustered Development. For clustered development layouts, the arrangements of residential dwelling units are not required to be on individual lots and there is no minimum lot size per each dwelling. However, when lots are included as part of a clustered development, such lots shall be of sufficient size and shape to accommodate dwelling units in compliance with the Montgomery County Combined Health District regulations as well as the spacing requirements of this Section.
32-A04.03 MAXIMUM DWELLING UNIT REQUIREMENTS.
A. Maximum Dwelling Unit Allowance. The maximum number of dwelling units permitted in a PD-A development shall be determined by producing a conventional, non-clustered development layout plan of the site with new streets and lot sizes that are not less than five (5) acres as required in Section 32-A04.02(A). The resulting number of lots yielded by a conventional, non-clustered development layout shall determine the maximum dwelling units allowed for both non-clustered and clustered development layouts.
B. Lot Bonus. A clustered development site layout may increase the maximum dwelling unit allowance by meeting one or more of the following additional health and safety conservation standards. Each bonus shall be computed by multiplying the sum of all bonus percentages which may apply against the number of lots yielded in 32-A04.03A and then adding this bonus number of lots to the number of lots yielded in 32-A04.03A. Individual bonuses shall only apply one time and the sum of all bonus percentages may not exceed thirty-five (35) percent. When the above formula produces a fractional value, the number shall be rounded to the nearest whole number with a fractional value of 0.5 rounded down to the nearest whole number.
1. Five (5) percent bonus if the selection and design of open space maximizes contiguous linear configuration of sufficient width, generally larger than 100 feet width designed as a single block with
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 32-A – “PD-A” PLANNED AGRICULTURE DISTRICT
Adopted: November 1972 32-A - 4
logical, straightforward boundaries, and minimizes fragmentation of open space so that these resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development. Long thin strips of open space shall be avoided, unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails.
2. Ten (10) percent bonus if the open space minimizes disturbance to mature or remnant woodlands, wetlands, vegetated riparian corridors and is limited to passive recreation activities such as hiking, biking, horseback riding, fishing or other activities which provide for conservation of environmental quality on the land and limits to five (5) percent of the total open space, golf courses and active recreation uses, such as housed facilities or the extensive use of ball fields.
3. Ten (10) percent bonus if the development maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural native species vegetation of at least one hundred (100) feet in depth on each side of wetlands and surface waters, including creeks, streams, springs, lakes and ponds.
4. Five (5) percent bonus if all required open space is interconnected with all dwellings such that each and every dwelling has direct, adjacent access to the open space system.
5. Five (5) percent bonus if the open space generally abuts existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels (such as in other subdivisions, public parks, or properties owned by or eased to private land conservation organizations). Such subdivision open space shall be designed as part of larger contiguous and integrated greenway systems.
32-A04.04 MINIMUM YARD REQUIREMENTS.
All Buildings in a PD-A Development District shall be located in compliance with the following development and site planning standards. The applicant shall depict on the development plan the maximum parameters, or building envelopes, to indicate where buildings shall be located, and shall demonstrate that such building locations will be in compliance with the spacing requirements of this section.

An application for a PD-A Planned Agricultural District shall only be processed, noticed, and heard by the Township Zoning Commission concurrently with an application for a proposed subdivision or re-subdivision of the same property pursuant to the subdivision regulations of Montgomery County. In addition to the requirements stated in Article 31 of the Miami Township Zoning Resolution, the Zoning Commission shall evaluate whether the submitted Final Development Plan:
A. Illustrates the location of wetlands, prime farmland soils according to the county soil survey, locations of all existing wooded areas, tree lines, hedgerows and specimen trees, existing drainage patterns, identification of unique vistas, along with existing
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 32-A – “PD-A” PLANNED AGRICULTURE DISTRICT
Adopted: November 1972 32-A - 9
wells and well sites.
B. Illustrates the location of building footprints or envelopes within which dwelling units are to be constructed. Proposed building envelopes or footprints shall demonstrate that building locations will be in compliance with applicable development and site planning standard requirements.
C. Provides the site with direct access to a major street without creating traffic on minor residential streets outside the development. Intersections between new roadways and existing roadways should be spaced as far apart as possible. Access to future adjacent developments must be provided.
D. Protects rural roadside character, maintains public safety and minimizes impact on vehicular carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting directly onto existing public roads.
E. Proposes road systems that are curvilinear and designed to follow natural topography as closely as possible, avoiding the need for extensive cutting and filling. The construction of new roadways in open fields is generally discouraged in favor of road construction at the edges of open fields, especially when necessary to provide access to home sites in adjacent wooded areas.
F. Cul-de-sac design should create large landscaped islands capable of supporting mature trees and other landscape elements.
G. Protects and preserves all floodplains, vegetated riparian corridors, wetlands, and steep slopes from clearing, grading, filling, or construction (except as may be approved by the Township for essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation amenities.)
H. Preserves and maintains mature or remnant woodlands, existing fields, pastures, meadows, and orchards, and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses.
I. Designs around existing hedgerows and treelines between fields or meadows, and minimizes impacts on large woodlands (greater than five acres), especially those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife habitat, or those not degraded by invasive vines.
1. Woodlands of any size on highly erodible soils with slopes greater than 10 percent should be avoided.
2. Woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential can provide suitable locations for residential development.
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 32-A – “PD-A” PLANNED AGRICULTURE DISTRICT
Adopted: November 1972 32-A - 10
3. When any woodland is developed, great care shall be taken to design all disturbed areas (for buildings, roads, yards, septic disposal fields, etc.) in locations where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas, to the fullest extent that is practicable.
J. Sites dwellings on the least prime agricultural soils protecting farmland of local importance, or in locations at the far edge of a field as seen from existing public roads, where development must be located on open fields or pastures because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site.
1. In most cases, homes should be in small clusters of units, not a single grouping or multiple large groupings. The number of units in clusters should vary in size and shape, but in most cases, should not exceed 25.
2. The creation of lawn areas greater than 10,000 s.f. should generally be avoided.
K. Leaves prominent or locally significant scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted, particularly as seen from public thoroughfares; Avoids the siting of new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges by taking advantage of lower topographic features.
1. In open agrarian landscapes, a deep “no-build, no-plant” buffer is recommended which utilizes the concept of “foreground meadows” with homes facing the public thoroughfare across a broad grassy expanse.
2. In wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained, a deep “no-build, no-cut” buffer should be respected, to preserve existing vegetation.
L. Landscapes common areas (such as community greens), cul-de-sac islands, and both sides of new streets with native species shade trees and flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value. Deciduous shade trees shall be planted at forty-foot intervals on both sides of each street, so that the neighborhood will have a stately and traditional appearance when they grow and mature. These trees shall generally be located between the sidewalk or footpath and the edge of the street, within a planting strip not less than five feet in width.
M. Visually buffers development from existing public roads, such as by a planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees, shrubs, and wildflowers.
1. Off-street parking for community buildings or similar structures should not be visible from roadways.
2. Parking areas should be located behind buildings or otherwise screened with
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 32-A – “PD-A” PLANNED AGRICULTURE DISTRICT
Adopted: November 1972 32-A - 11
mounding or plant material.
3. Any lighting from parking areas should not be visible from an existing public roadway.
4. New trees should mainly be limited to varieties found on the site and/or nearby, and should be planted in a random pattern (not single rows or a single species.)
O. Designs around and preserves sites of historic, archaeological, or cultural value, and their environs, insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the feature, including stone walls, spring houses, barn foundations, cellar holes, earthworks, and burial grounds; Existing barns or other agricultural structures should be preserved where possible and incorporated in to the development.
1. Establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor of rural roads. To help maintain rural character, required open space, historic buildings, stone walls, hedgerows, etc; should be located along existing roadways to act as a buffer between developed land and the roadway.
2. Protects wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered, threatened, or of special concern by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Ohio Natural Heritage Data Base.
3. Provides active recreational areas in suitable locations that offer convenient access by residents and adequate screening from nearby houselots.
P. Includes a pedestrian pathway system designed to assure that pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site among all residential properties, open spaces and recreational features. Such a pathway system may or may not be located in a road right-of-way and should provide interconnections between open spaces in a development. All roadside footpaths should connect with off-road trails, which in turn should link with potential common open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels (or with existing open space on adjoining developed parcels, where applicable.
Q. Controls storm drainage by permanent retention ponds. Ponds designed to hold storm water at all times should be designed as open space amenities. Meter pipes should be incorporated into the drainage system to slow discharge of water into existing waterways. Where possible, storm water should flow through grass swales to retention ponds to slow runoff and filter pollutants.
R. Complies with the requirements of the Miami Township Fire Department.

SECTION 3701 | MINIMUM FLOOR AREA FOR DWELLINGS.
See Section 2900 and/or appropriate Districts.
SECTION 3702 | STREET FRONTAGE REQUIRED.
Except as permitted by other provisions of the Zoning Resolution, no lot or parcel shall contain any building used in whole or in part for residential purposes unless the front lot line of such lot abuts fully on a dedicated street. There shall be not more than one principal building for each lot. Each lot shall meet the frontage requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.
SECTION 3703 | TRAFFIC VISIBILITY ACROSS CORNER LOTS.

ARTICLE 38 – ACCESSORY USES
Revised: April, 2019 – Res. 020-2019 38 - 1
ARTICLE 38 | ACCESSORY USES
SECTION 38.01 | PURPOSE
A. This section authorizes the establishment of accessory uses that are incidental, related and customarily subordinate to principal permitted uses. For the purpose of this section, the term accessory use shall be used in conjunction with accessory structure or may be used in placement thereof.
B. Accessory uses and structures may be detached or attached to the primary structure. An example of an attached accessory structure is a deck. When determining if an accessory structure is an attached accessory structure or a dwelling addition the following shall be considered:
1. A dwelling addition shall be integrated visually, structurally and architecturally with the principal structure, has an attached roof with similar design to the principal structure, permits access between the principal structure and the addition either internally or under the roof, and/or shares a common wall with the principal structure or is connected to the principal structure by an enclosed space.
2. An attached accessory structure shall be an unenclosed space that may have solid walls no greater than 18 inches in height around its entire exterior. It may have a fence or railings that are not opaque up to 48 inches. It shall not be screened, walled, or provided with glass from floor to ceiling, where the enclosed interior space is completely separated from the outside.
SECTION 38.02 | FINDINGS
In adopting these regulations, the Miami Township Board of Trustees finds that:
A. It is necessary to set back accessory uses from residential property lines in order to provide adequate space to ensure weeds and other nuisance vegetation can be adequately controlled and that drainage flow between and along property lines is not impeded in order to protect the public health and safety.
B. It is necessary to limit the height and extent of accessory uses to ensure that adjoining property owners are not unduly deprived of access to sunlight and air circulation to their property.
C. Accessory uses are to be subordinate in size and appearance to principal permitted structures and therefore should be restricted in size, height and location in order to maintain the integrity of the permitted uses within the various districts and protect property values and the general public welfare.
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 38 – ACCESSORY USES
Revised: April, 2019 – Res. 020-2019 38 - 2
D. Some accessory uses and their associated activities, while permissible for limited durations, would create an undue impact on neighboring properties if permitted on a permanent basis due either to the size, scope, or general location of such activities.
SECTION 38.03 | GENERAL PROVISIONS
Accessory uses or structures shall be permitted provided:
A. The structure or use is incidental to and customarily found in connection with a principal structure or use permitted in the district in which it is located.
B. It is subordinate to and serves the principal structure or use.
C. It is subordinate in area, extent, or purpose to the principal structure.
D. It is located on the same parcel as the principal structure or use for which it serves.
E. An owner applies for and receives a zoning certificate, unless exempted or not required by this resolution.
F. An accessory use or structure shall not be established unless a principal use has first been established on a site in conformance with the applicable provisions of the zoning resolution.
G. No detached accessory building or structure shall contain facilities used for dwelling purposes. This does not preclude use of a guest house per the standards of Article 38.
H. Home Occupations.
1. Except as provided below, no accessory building or structure shall be used to operate a business, store equipment or supplies used for a business, or be a location where employees meet or park, in any standard agricultural district, residential district, or recorded residential subdivision.
2. It is not intended for residential properties to be used for business. As it relates to home occupations a business is defined under ORC 5701.08, “includes all enterprises, except agriculture, conducted for gain, profit, or income and extends to personal service occupations.”
3. The above is true except for:
a. Accessory structures approved as part of a final development plan within a planned development for an associated business use in a mixed-use development.
b. Business lawfully established in an agricultural district and used in support of the agricultural use of the property or a business approved as a permitted or

MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 41 – SIGN REGULATIONS
Revised: December, 2011 – Res. 168-2011 41 - 1
ARTICLE 41 | SIGN REGULATIONS
Signs are a vital part of Miami Township as sources of information and as components in the landscape. They contribute to the health, safety, and general welfare of the community by giving general information, location, direction, and warning.
A. PURPOSE
It is the intent of Miami Township to have uniform sign standards for the following purposes:
1. To protect the right of free speech, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States of America, by permitting non-commercial signs on any property.
2. To regulate the time, place, and manner of signage in order to protect the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare by:
a. Permitting a variety of non-commercial and commercial signage within Miami Township
b. Prohibiting signs that cause a hazard to the public due to; but not limited to, the setback, illumination, or movement of a signs message
c. Protecting public safety by requiring the removal or repair of damaged signs
d. Limiting visual clutter in order to promote a healthier business and community atmosphere through increased property values by regulating the height, quantity, and placement of signs
e. Promoting the visibility of adjacent properties and streetscape aesthetics by regulating the height, area, quantity, movement, and landscaping of signage
f. Establishing conditions under which non-conforming signage must be brought into conformity
B. FINDINGS
In adopting these regulations, the Miami Township Board of Trustees finds that:
1. Miami Township originally enacted sign regulations as part of the enactment of the Zoning Resolution effective November 20, 1972; and
2. Miami Township has not been a defendant in litigation concerning the sign regulations since their enactment; and
3. These regulations will further Miami Township’s desire to have sign regulations that will fulfill the purpose and intent stated in these regulations and abide by
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 41 – SIGN REGULATIONS
Revised: December, 2011 – Res. 168-2011 41 - 2
Constitutional guarantees concerning free speech and freedom of expression; and
4. Miami Township has retained the firm of Surdyk, Dowd, and Turner Co., L.P.A. to oversee the development of these sign regulations and said firm has expert experience in developing sign regulations based upon protecting Constitutional guarantees of free speech and freedom of expression; and
5. A growing number of non-commercial and commercial freestanding monument signs are abiding by the terms of these regulations, and provisions seeking the removal and replacement of non-conforming signs with conforming signs have been enforced since the original enactment of these regulations. Miami Township has a declining number of non-conforming roof signs, pylon signs, and wall signs; and
6. Greater flexibility is needed in the provision of wall signs and other types of signage within the various non-commercial and commercial areas of the Township; and
7. There is a continued need to have a consistent system of sign standards to ensure the continued safety and attractiveness of non-commercial and commercial areas and to provide a fair and consistent method of sign allowances in order to protect property values and protect the general public welfare; and
8. Establishing specific setback and height standards will promote public safety and general welfare by allowing for future right-of-way and roadway expansions, and restricting signage that will block site visibility for those entering or leaving a property; and
9. Establishing height and area standards will promote uniform sign design, reduce the instances of larger signs visually blocking signs or buildings on adjacent properties, reduce the visual clutter of multiple pylon signs at varying heights and sizes, and permit certain larger signs to accommodate multiple tenants on a single sign in order to consolidate signage; and
10. There is a continued need for standards for the area of signage on buildings in order to provide signage to users in a proportional and consistent manner based upon the size of the wall upon which such signs are to be placed; and
11. Establishing certain landscaping and architectural standards will promote a uniform appearance for the majority of free standing signage to be utilized; and
12. There is a need for a variety of structural and functional signs to provide information to persons on or off a property; and
13. There is a need to maintain appropriate standards for placing address
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 41 – SIGN REGULATIONS
Revised: December, 2011 – Res. 168-2011 41 - 3
information on buildings in order to protect the public health and safety; and
14. It is in the interest of public health, safety, and general welfare to provide a process for review of sign packages for large commercial shopping centers due to the number of private drives, unique pedestrian and traffic patterns, and unique building configurations found in such large complexes.
The following minimum regulations are applicable to all districts; and to all "PD" Planned Development Districts, unless the Board of Trustees, as part of a Final Development Plan, approves other standards.
SECTION 4101 | GENERAL PROVISIONS.
The following general provisions are applicable to all signs unless modified by the general requirements or standards of a specific district.
Any sign allowed under this resolution may contain, in lieu of any other copy, any otherwise lawful non-commercial message that does not direct attention to a business or to a commodity or service for sale and that complies with all other provisions of this Resolution, including the specific provisions for signage in the land use category on which the sign is placed. No sign intended, permitted, or regulated as an on premise sign shall display off-premise commercial messages.
This code is written to provide a user-friendly method of identifying the specific standards for each type of sign. Each sign has 5 basic categories, Area, Height, Setback, Quantity, and Special Restrictions. In each case the phrase “provided the following standards are not exceeded” shall mean that no sign face shall exceed the specified area and number of faces, no sign shall exceed the specified height, no sign shall be set closer to the road right-of-way or roadway, whichever is noted, than specified under the setback standard, no sign shall exceed the total number of signs specified under the quantity limitation, and no sign shall violate the special restrictions listed. Standards for specific sign types are also specified under Section 4102 and 4103 and shall be followed, except as specifically modified in the district in which the sign is to be located.
For the purposes of these sign regulations, a “public roadway” shall mean a street that is an improved public right-of-way fifty (50) feet or more in width which provides a public means of access to abutting property or any such right-of-way more than thirty (30) feet and less than fifty (50) feet in width provided it existed prior to the enactment of this Resolution and provided such street has been accepted by Montgomery County. The term "street" shall include avenue, drive, circle, road, parkway, boulevard, highway, thoroughfare or any other similar term. To front on a public roadway a building must have direct frontage between the building and the street that is unobstructed by other properties. In cases where a parcel has no direct frontage on a public street other than Interstate 75 or Interstate 675 and is not adjacent to parcels under the same ownership that have public street frontage, the property shall be considered to have at least one frontage in addition to any interstate frontage.

MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 41 – SIGN REGULATIONS
Revised: December, 2011 – Res. 168-2011 41 - 13
contrivance designed, intended, or used to direct attention to a use, commodity or service not related to the premises on which the sign is located. A non-commercial message may be displayed in lieu of, or in conjunction with, any commercial message.
Each advertising sign shall be permanently identified with the name of the sign owner or agency in control of the sign with letters of sufficient size to be easily read from the nearest roadway, but not more than five (5) square feet. Such permanent identification shall be affixed to the sign structure, bottom of the sign face, or necessary supports or uprights on which such sign is placed and not be part of the advertising copy.
A. Static - Non-Electronic Advertising Signs
Static off-premise commercial advertising displays are intended to be permitted in larger numbers than electronic displays due to the decreased visibility of such static displays and the inability to rapidly modify the message at any single location. This section is intended to size and space such displays at a distance sufficient to not overly intrude upon the visual landscape. Such signs shall meet the following criteria:
1. Advertising signs shall be located only in Business and Industrial Districts, and on lands zoned "A" Agricultural and/or used for agricultural purposes.
2. No such sign shall be placed within three hundred (300) feet of any residential structure in a Residential District.
3. No static or non-electronic advertising sign shall be erected or maintained within six hundred sixty (660) feet of the edge of the right-of-way of a highway on the Interstate and Primary systems in accordance with Chapter 5516 of the Revised Code of the State of Ohio.
4. Size and spacing.
With the exception of signs within the B-3 and B-4 Business District, which signs shall be permitted to have up to one hundred (100) square feet of additional non-commercial display area per side of the sign, no static or non-electronic advertising sign shall be larger than a poster panel, twenty-four and one-half (24 1/2) feet long and twelve and one-quarter (12 1/4) feet high, per supporting structure, with up to two (2) faces per pole or location on a single display panel or split panel with such faces placed back to back, nor shall any advertising sign be placed closer than one thousand (1000) feet to any other advertising sign. .No advertising sign shall exceed forty (40) feet in height.

ARTICLE 41 – SIGN REGULATIONS
Revised: December, 2011 – Res. 168-2011 41 - 14
5. No static or non-electronic advertising sign shall incorporate an electronic or changeable copy display.
6. Static or non-electronic advertising signs within the B-3 and B-4 Business District shall be subject to the Architectural Review standards and procedures of Subsection 4103.01 B.14.
B. Electronic – Digital Advertising Signs
This section is intended to permit in limited circumstances, large format electronic displays that provide off-premise commercial advertisement or any other non-commercial message. Due to the size, enhanced visibility, and the ability for advertisers to display multiple messages from a single location in rapid succession, it is the intent to require certain design criteria to establish such signs as community features and to ensure that they are architecturally compatible with the core retail district in which they are placed. Such signs shall meet the following criteria:
1. Digital Advertising Signs shall be located only in the “B-3” or “B-4” Business Districts.
2. No such sign shall be placed within three hundred (300) feet of any residential structure in a Residential District.
3. No such sign shall be erected or maintained within six hundred sixty (660) feet of the edge of the right-of-way of a highway on the Interstate system in accordance with Chapter 5516 of the Revised Code of the State of Ohio.
4. No such sign exceeds three hundred seventy eight (378) square feet of digital display area per face with a maximum of two (2) faces placed back to back. An additional display area of one hundred (100) square feet of non-commercial display area may also be placed per side of the sign structure.
5. No such sign shall exceed forty (40) feet in height to the top of the digital display panel. The sign structure may extend to fifty (50) feet in height to accommodate architectural features or a static non-commercial and non-digital display area not exceeding forty (40) square feet.
6. No such sign is located within four thousand (4,000) feet of any other Digital Advertising Sign on the same roadway nor within two thousand (2,000) feet of any other Digital Advertising Sign on any other roadway
7. No such sign shall be located within one thousand (1,000) feet of any
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 41 – SIGN REGULATIONS
Revised: December, 2011 – Res. 168-2011 41 - 15
other outdoor advertising display unless such display involves the conversion of an existing legal non-conforming advertising display to a Digital Advertising Display meeting the other requirements of this section and at least three hundred (300) square feet of additional legal non-conforming sign area at a separate location within unincorporated Miami Township is removed within a four thousand (4,000) foot radius of the proposed sign.
8. Such signage does not cause a glare and signs shall utilize automatic dimming technology to adjust the brightness of the sign relative to ambient light so that at no time shall a sign exceed a brightness level of three tenths (0.3) foot candles above ambient light, as measured using a foot candle (Lux) meter and in conformance with the following process:
a. Light measurements shall be taken with the meter aimed directly at the sign message face, or at the area of the sign emitting the brightest light if that area is not the sign message face, at the following distances:
i. A sign that is 0 to 100 square-feet in area shall be measured at a distance of 100 feet from the sign area being measured,;
ii. A sign that is 101 to 378 square-feet in area shall be measured at a distance of 150 feet from the sign area being measured.
b. An ambient light measurement shall be taken using a foot candle meter at some point between the period of time between thirty (30) minutes past sunset and thirty (30) minutes before sunrise with the sign turned off to a black screen.
c. Immediately following the ambient light measurement taken in the manner required by this Subsection, an operating sign light measurement shall be taken with the sign turned on to full white copy.
d. The brightness of a sign conforms with the brightness requirements of this Subsection if the difference between the ambient light measurement and the operating sign light measurement is three tenths (0.3) foot candles or less.
e. All signs shall contain a default mechanism that will cause the sign to revert immediately to a black screen if the sign malfunctions.
f. The lighting intensity level must be capable of being remotely and manually adjusted.

12. Such signs shall employ a minimum physical pixel pitch of twenty (20) millimeters and shall be capable of producing true NTSC (National Television System Committee) color.
13. Architectural Design Review Required. Advertising signs are unique structures within the community in that they are both informational devices but also primary uses and structures due to the use of the devices for off-premise advertising and the size and height of the devices compared to other signs and buildings within the community. Due to the significant visual impact upon the community, the concentration of such devices within the business districts as compared to other districts, and the desire to limit the distractive impacts of advertising displays, all electronic and non-electronic Advertising Signs in the B-3 and B-4 Business District shall be reviewed for architectural design approval by the Miami Township Zoning Commission. The following procedures and standards shall be followed in submission and review of such signage for design compliance:
a. Such signs shall be submitted to the Zoning Commission by filing a completed Miami Township Digital Gateway Advertising Sign Architectural Review application and submitting the required fee for Architectural Reviews.
b. Applications shall be reviewed and heard in the order in which they are received and the Zoning Commission may not approve a sign to be located in a manner that would violate the distance requirements of this section, except under the following condition:
i. An approval by the Zoning Commission shall be valid for one
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 41 – SIGN REGULATIONS
Revised: December, 2011 – Res. 168-2011 41 - 17
year, however; if a zoning certificate is not obtained within six (6) months of approval then the Zoning Commission may hear and approve another sign within the distance limitations of the first sign. If the first sign does not receive a zoning certificate and begin construction within one year from the date of the Zoning Commission approval then the approval of the first sign shall be null and void and the second sign may apply for a zoning certificate. The approval time for a second and subsequent signs shall be determined under the same schedule as the first sign beginning with each signs subsequent Zoning Commission approval date.
c. Each completed application shall be filed with the Miami Township Planning and Zoning Department at least ten (10) business days prior to the Zoning Commission hearing date

f. It is the intent of the following architectural design standards to create sign structures that are both community focal points and represent a blending of traditional architectural design with modern technology. The sign structures should utilize several techniques to create pronounced yet human scale elements that subdivide the structure into distinct sections and create the illusion of a more substantial building. The architectural design shall utilize design elements such as offsets, arches, recesses, protrusions, and integrally textured elements such as decorative stone or brick, in such combination as to create a unique, inviting, and decorative focal point for the community. The architectural design shall encase the support structures of the sign such that the sign appears incorporated into a larger overall decorative structure. Structures shall have a defined base and cap. Colors utilized for the sign structure shall be earth toned and compatible with traditional brick and natural stone colors. The design shall not utilize neon, fluorescent, bright primary colors, metallic colors or other similar high intensity colors.

For residential tracts less than 40,000 sq. ft. in the "A" Agricultural District, and all tracts in "R" Districts, all open off-street parking areas shall be graded and surfaced with bituminous concrete (asphalt), portland cement concrete, brick, cobble-stone or similar hard surface, except a space required for recreational or camping equipment as described in Article 38, Section 380l. Tracts with nonconforming gravel driveways may have gravel parking areas, but in no case shall a landscaped area (i.e., neither paved nor graveled) be used as an open off-street parking area.
All driveway or off-street parking area surfaces must be constructed and maintained according to commonly accepted practices.
B. Separation.
All open off-street parking areas shall be separated from public sidewalks by a space at least four (4) feet in width, and a six (6) inch high barrier (curb) shall be provided on the parking lot side of the four (4) foot width.
C. Screening.
When any open off-street parking area used for any non-residential purpose containing more than two (2) parking spaces is not separated from a residentially used property or portion thereof, by a dedicated street, an effective buffer or screen consisting of a solid wall, fence, or dense living hedge, shall be provided at the lot line to protect the privacy of the adjoining residential uses. Such wall, fence, or hedge shall be not less than six (6) feet in height.
D. Lighting.
Any lighting used to illuminate off- street parking areas shall be equipped with suitable shielding or be so designed as to prevent a glare at eye level on surrounding public or private property.
E. Repair and Service.
No motor vehicle repair work or service of any kind, except emergency repairs, shall be permitted in or in association with any off-street parking area.
F. Drainage.
All open off-street parking areas shall be provided with adequate drainage facilities as approved by the County Engineer. Said approval will not be required for off street parking in Districts "A" through "R-5," and the "R-9" Residential District. Single family and two family uses in "R-6" and "R-7" Residential Districts are exempt from this requirement, however.

H. Marking.
Designated parking spaces shall be marked on the surface of the parking area with paint or permanent marking materials and maintained in clearly visible condition.
4303.03 UNITS OR MEASUREMENT.
For the purpose of determining off-street parking requirements, the following units of measurements shall apply:
A. Floor Area.
Floor area for nonresidential purposes shall be the sum of the gross horizontal area of all the floors of a building measured from the exterior faces of the exterior walls or from the center line of walls separating two (2) buildings.
B. Hospital Bassinets.
In hospitals, bassinets shall not be counted as beds.
C. Places of Public Assembly.
1. Benches.
In stadiums, sports arenas, churches and other places of assembly in which those in attendance occupy benches, pews or other similar seating facilities, each twenty (20) inches of such seating facilities shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the off-street parking requirements of this Zoning Resolution.
2. Fixed Seats and Assembly Area.
In cases where a place of assembly has both fixed seats and open assembly area, requirements shall be computed separately for each type and added together.
D. Fractions.
When units of measurement determining the number of required parking spaces result in requirement of a fractional space, and fraction up to one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded and fractions of over and including one-half (1/2) shall require one parking space.

Revised: January 2012, – Res. 18-2012 43 - 9
4303.04 ADDITIONS AND EXTENSIONS.
Whenever any addition to a building or extension of land use results in an increase in the number of units used to measure required off-street parking spaces, and such addition or extension creates a need for an increase of more than ten (10) percent in the number of required off-street parking spaces, additional off-street parking shall be provided on the basis of the increase in the number of such units of measurement.
A. Exception.
In the case of additional dwelling units created by conversion of an existing dwelling, one off-street parking space shall be required for each additional dwelling unit so created.
4303.05 MIXED OCCUPANCIES AND USES NOT SPECIFIED.
In the case of mixed uses, the total requirements for off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed separately. Where a use is not specifically mentioned in Section 4302, the requirements for a use which is so mentioned and to which said use is similar shall apply. Off-street parking facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing requirements for any other use, except as specified for joint use.
4303.06 COLLECTIVE PROVISION.
Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prevent collective provision of off-street parking facilities for two (2) or more buildings or uses, provided that the total of such off-street parking spaces supplied collectively shall be not less than the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed separately; provided, however, that the requirements set forth in Subsection 4303.01-E as to maximum distances between parking areas and establishments served shall apply to each establishment participating in the collective provisions of parking.

For the purpose of measuring the intensity and frequency of sound, the sound level meter, the octave band analyzer, and the impact noise analyzer shall be employed. The flat network and the fast meter response of the sound level meter shall be used. Sounds of short duration as from forge hammers, punch presses, and metal shears which cannot be measured accurately with the sound level meter shall be measured with the impact noise analyzer.
Octave band analyzers calibrated in the Preferred Frequencies (American Standards Association Sl, 6-1960, Preferred Frequencies for Acoustical Measurements) shall be used with Table I (A through D). Octave band analyzers calibrated with pre-1960 Octave Band (American Standards Association Z24-10-1953, Octave Band Filter Set) shall use Table II (A through D) in Sections 4404 through 4406, inclusive. For impact sounds measured with the impact noise analyzer, the sound pressure levels set forth in Tables I and II (A through D) may be increased by six (6) decibels in each octave band.
SECTION 4402 | EXEMPTIONS.
The following uses and activities shall be exempt from the noise level regulations:
A. Noises not directly under the control of the property users.
B. Noises emanating from construction and maintenance activities between 7 A.M. and 9 P.M.
C. The noises of safety signals, warning devices, and emergency pressure relief valves.
D. Transient noises of moving sources such as automobiles, trucks, airplanes and railroads.

Revised: March, 2006 – Res. 63-2006 45-A - 1
ARTICLE 45-A | LANDSCAPING
Landscaping of unpaved areas of Miami Township promotes the health, safety, and general welfare of the community by reducing soil erosion, controlling water runoff and lessening flood potential, reducing the ability of pollutants to enter waterways, protecting air quality, reducing energy demands for heating and cooling, providing buffers from wind and noise, and protects the natural heritage of the community through the planting and preservation of native plants and trees. The following minimum regulations are applicable to all districts; and to all "PD" Districts unless the Board of Trustees, as part of a Final Development Plan, approves other standards.
SECTION 45-A01 | LANDSCAPING PLAN.
A. A landscaping plan shall be required in all "O," "B," "I," "PS", “AC-1 through 5,” and "RO" Districts to obtain a zoning certificate. A landscape plan shall also be required in all “PD” Districts that contain business, office, or other commercial uses. Landscape plans shall include information regarding areas to be covered by grass and/or ground cover; the number, type, caliper or DBH as appropriate, and height of trees, hedges, and shrubs; information regarding non-living material such as rock or wood, lighting fixtures; fences, walls, hedges or shrubbery as described in Section 3909; and screening. Plans shall include any ponds or water management acres, which are incorporated in the landscaping. Plans shall also show all perennial and intermittent streams and the location of stream banks on site.
1. Landscape plans involving the development of 1,000 square feet or greater of building or other impervious surface area shall be stamped by a registered landscape architect.
2. For all earthen berms used for screening, the plan shall indicate their height and area, their exact location from the right-of-way and property lines, and the direction of storm water flow.
3. A copy of a wetlands plan or agreement protecting or creating wetlands on site shall be provided with the application if used towards meeting landscaping requirements. The plan must be approved plan through the Army Corps of Engineers or Environmental Protection Agency and provide for monitoring and maintenance of the wetlands area. Wetlands must be clearly denoted on the landscape plan with area expressed in total square feet.
4. Plans must clearly denote all existing trees to be preserved and used toward meeting the requirements of this article. Tree type, size measured by DBH, and location must be clearly shown on the plan as well as how the tree preservation zone will be identified.

ARTICLE 45-A – LANDSCAPING
Revised: March, 2006 – Res. 63-2006 45-A - 2
SECTION 45-A02 | COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE.
A. Landscaping shall be installed within sixty (60) days of the completion of the building, structure, or use applied for, or as soon as weather conditions permit if such period falls within the winter months. Landscaping requiring a specific planting time outside of the standard sixty (60) day requirement shall be noted on the plans and installed within thirty (30) days of the time noted. Noted times shall not be longer than six months past the completion of the building.
B. All landscaping areas including those added beyond the requirements of this section shall receive regular maintenance, including trimming, mowing, watering, and replacement of diseased or decayed plant materials when required.
SECTION 45-A03 | LANDSCAPING ZONES.
The intent of the landscaping zones are to provide flexibility in tree location, size, and type and to avoid tree plantings that leave trees with too little soil volume to achieve a mature height and form. Each landscape plan shall meet the following standards:
For the purposes of this Article, the following terms are defined as follows:
Large Tree = Deciduous trees greater than or equal to 50’ at normal full grown height.
Medium Tree = Deciduous trees between 30’ and 50’ at normal full grown height.
Small Tree = Deciduous trees that normally attain a full-grown height of less than 30’.
Evergreen Tree = Minimum six (6) foot high tree that does not lose its leaves during the year and the leaves will remain green throughout the year.
A. Site Tree Requirement
The total number of trees required per site shall be based upon the following formula:
1. Site Trees Required = Building Coverage Zone + Impervious Surface & Parking Zone + Frontage Tree Zone Requirement + Screening Requirement (Fractional tree numbers under each zone shall be rounded up to the next whole tree)
B. Building Coverage Zone
One (1) large tree shall be planted on the site for every 1,500 square feet of building coverage for sites up to 5.0 acres in size and at a rate of one (1) large tree for every 2,000 square feet of building coverage for sites greater than 5.0 acres in size. Emphasis shall be given to planting trees around the perimeter of the building, in areas to screen dumpsters and loading areas, and along property lines. Trees planted to meet the requirements for building coverage may be planted in additional locations on
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 45-A – LANDSCAPING
Revised: March, 2006 – Res. 63-2006 45-A - 3
the site provided each tree has enough space to reach full maturity. Trees planted to meet the frontage zone requirements may be counted towards the requirement for building coverage trees.
C. Impervious Surface & Parking Zone
1. One (1) large tree shall be planted for every 1,500 square feet of parking lot coverage, loading and unloading areas, vehicular use areas, and other impervious areas outside of the building coverage and walkways for sites up to 5.0 acres in size and at a rate of one (1) large tree for every 2,000 square feet of such impervious surface coverage for sites greater than 5.0 acres in size.
2. A minimum of 40% of the trees needed to meet the parking area zone requirement shall be planted inside the boundaries of the parking area in landscape islands or other projections that extend into the parking field and are surrounded on at least two sides by parking spaces or other vehicular use areas. The remainder of the trees shall be planted along the perimeter and within 10 feet of the parking area or associated drive aisles.
3. No parking space shall be more than 80 feet from at least two large trees or equivalent number of medium or small tree substitutions.
4. Required trees placed in landscape islands shall be placed in a space containing at least 170 square feet of pervious surface area per tree, with the smallest dimension of pervious surface area being 6 feet, to allow for adequate root aeration and expansion. Islands may contain areas of less than 6 feet outside of the area required for tree plantings.
D. Frontage Tree Zone
1. Trees shall be placed at a rate of one large tree for every 35’ of road frontage or one medium tree for every 25’ of road frontage or one small tree for every 15’ of road frontage. A combination of tree sizes may also be utilized.
2. Up to one quarter of the required trees along an interstate route or other public road frontage may be grouped together, provided each tree has adequate space to reach full maturity, in order to provide visibility to signage or building facades. Trees shall otherwise be spaced in a naturalistic or semi-linear fashion along the entire length of the road frontage.
3. The portion of frontage occupied by a legal point of ingress or egress may be excluded but only to the extent required to provide the required access.
4. Frontage trees shall be placed within 20 feet of the road right-of-way of all public roads including interstate highways.

ARTICLE 45-A – LANDSCAPING
Revised: March, 2006 – Res. 63-2006 45-A - 4
5. Frontage tree zones shall have a minimum width of 5 feet measured from the street right-of-way line as shown on the Thoroughfare Plan, or 10 feet from the district boundary if said boundary adjoins an “A,” “R,” “PD-A,” “PD-l,” or “PD-5” (if used for residential purposes) District on the same side of the street and in the same block.
E. Screening Zones
1. Whenever an "O," "B," "I,” "PD-2,” “PD-3,” “PD-4,” or “PD-5" District adjoins an "A," "R,” “PD-A,” or "PD-l" District, a buffer strip shall be established along the entire length of the district boundary. Said buffer shall be a yard landscaped as described in Subsection 2l2.02, and contain a row of large deciduous trees each 2 inches or more in caliper spaced at a rate of one tree per 35 lineal feet and a row of evergreens spaced 8'-10' on center and staggered in such a way to form a visual barrier. This barrier shall be planted immediately inside and along the entire length of the common boundary line but not closer than the building setback line to a street right-of-way. Large deciduous trees and 50% of evergreen trees planted to meet the screening zone requirement or used to screen trash collection and utility areas on the site may count towards meeting the requirement for building coverage trees.
F. Tree Preservation Zone
1. Prior to construction and grading, perimeter fencing must be erected around protected trees at a distance of at least 6 feet from the trunk or to the drip line of the tree, whichever is greater.
2. Large parcels containing protected trees and separated from construction or land clearing areas, road rights-of-way and utility easements may be roped off by placing stakes 50 feet or more apart and tying ribbon or rope from stake to stake along the perimeter. Storage or movement of equipment, material, debris or fill, in the tree protection zone is prohibited.
G. Stream Landscaping Zones
1. A minimum of 15 feet from bank edge of perennial streams (solid blue line streams as shown on United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps) and shall be landscaped with trees and/or other native vegetation. Landscaping shall extend for the full length of the stream on site and shall be on both sides of banks that fall on the site.
2. Intermittent streams (dashed blue line streams as shown on USGS maps) shall be landscaped for a minimum width of 10 feet from each bank edge. Landscaping shall extend for the full length of the stream on site and shall be on both sides of banks that fall on the site.

3. These regulations do not intend to prohibit the use of stream crossings for vehicular or pedestrian traffic, but such crossings shall be the minimum required both in quantity and width to provide for such traffic and shall not be used for parking areas. The Planning Director may request that the Montgomery County Engineer provide a recommendation as to the number and width of crossings required for a particular development.
SECTION 45-A04 | LANDSCAPING SUBSTITUTIONS.
The following substitutions are permitted provided the standards for frontage and screening zone requirements are met. Parking zone tree amounts may be substituted once the requirements for 80-foot parking space coverage and a minimum of 40% of the trees being inside the parking field have been met. In no case shall the total number of trees required per site be reduced by more than 50% once all substitutions have been made.
A. Up to 50% of the combined number of large trees required to meet the building and parking zone requirements may be substituted with a small or medium tree, provided the number of trees provided is increased at the rate of 1.25 medium trees/large tree and 1.5 small trees/large tree with all substitutions rounded up to the next whole tree.
B. For every 250 square feet of federally designated wetlands that are preserved or created on site and maintained under an EPA or Army Corps of Engineers approved wetlands plan, the total number of building or parking zone trees required may be reduced by the equivalent of 1 large tree.
C. Water quality control practices enhance the community by providing filtration of pollutants prior to their entering stream channels and other bodies of water. For each water quality control practice that is installed to provide direct filtration of sediment and other contaminants through the use of landscaping, such as landscaped swales, parking lot runoff collectors, rain gardens, etc. and that are identified and recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a stormwater best management practice shall qualify for a 5% reduction in the total number of building or parking zone trees required. Each stormwater management practice must be certified by an engineer to separately treat at least 15% of the total runoff of the site and be approved by the Montgomery County Engineer’s Office.
D. Where healthy trees of native species are preserved, the number of required building or parking zone trees required may be reduced based upon the following table:

B. Evergreen trees used to meet the requirements of this section must be a minimum of 6 feet in height upon planting, as measured from the top of the root ball.
C. In order to reduce the potential for the spread of diseases and to reduce monotony of design, no more than 40% of trees planted shall be from the same genus.
D. A minimum of 50% of trees planted must be native trees. See Appendix B for a list of native trees and other recommended plantings.
E. Soil volumes should be connected to the extent possible to allow trees maximum root growth and access to water. To the extent possible, approximately 2 cubic feet of usable soil volume should be provided for every one square foot of mature canopy volume. This may be calculated by measuring the area within the projected mature drip line of the tree.
F. All required landscape elements shall be located on the property requiring the landscape plan.
G. Existing trees that are damaged or destroyed due to natural conditions or other natural causes and are part of the approved landscape plan shall be replaced at a rate of 1 large native tree per tree removed or lost due to such natural causes. Trees removed other than due to natural causes shall be replaced at a rate of 1 large native tree for every 2” caliper of trees removed. Trees planted as part of a landscape plan that are damaged, diseased, and/or otherwise in need of removal shall be replaced with an equivalent tree meeting the requirements of this Article.
H. Trees planted to meet the minimum requirements of this Article shall not be topped or otherwise prevented from attaining a natural mature canopy. Directional pruning

K. Silver Maple, Acer saccharinum
L. Tree-of-Heaven, Ailanthus altissima
M. Ash – Limited to no more than 15% of all new plantings, existing native species may be used towards meeting the native tree preservation standards
SECTION 45-A07 | BUILDING & IMPERVIOUS AREA EXPANSIONS.
The requirements of this Article shall apply to all new building and impervious surface area additions. All existing sites shall be required to install landscaping meeting the requirements of this section based upon the number of square feet of impervious surface to be added. A minimum of one large tree shall be required unless such addition will not exceed 150 square feet of impervious area within a one-year time frame. Trees may be planted on any portion of the site not meeting current requirements.
Non-conforming sites that will have an existing building remodeled or reconstructed to the extent of 50% or more of the appraised value of the building shall meet the landscaping requirements for the building coverage zone for that building in addition to any requirements pertaining to new construction on the site.
A. Amounts at or above 0.5 shall be rounded to the next whole number and amounts below 0.5 shall be rounded to zero, except as specifically modified by each section.
SECTION 45-A08 | LANDSCAPING DESIGN REVIEW OPTION.

MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 45-A – LANDSCAPING
Revised: March, 2006 – Res. 63-2006 45-A - 8
modified plan based substantially upon the standards and intent of this Article but that may address issues of particular hardship due to quantity, spacing, size, or locational requirements for plantings. Variations from the requirements of this article and otherwise permitted substitutions shall not be made without appropriate substitutions through either uniqueness of design, improvement of water filtration aspects of the landscaping design, enhancement of pedestrian amenities beyond standard sidewalk designs, substantial wetland creation, or other landscaping enhancements, such as fountains, that the Zoning Commission finds to merit a variation from the other standards of this article. In no case shall the total number of required large trees or their equivalent be reduced by more than 75% under the Landscape Review Option.
SECTION 45-A09 | NATURAL LANDSCAPING.
A. A landscaping plan shall be required in all districts to obtain the required zoning certificate for native vegetation, including prairie grasses, in planned landscapes and to use such plants in the preservation or restoration of natural plant communities. The intent of this section is not, however, to allow vegetated areas to be unmanaged or overgrown when such growth provides a demonstrated health hazard, or prevents detection of accumulated trash and refuse that constitutes either a direct health hazard or provides a breeding ground for fauna known to create a safety or health hazard.
The plan shall be in accordance with the following:
1. The native vegetation area shall be at least 10 feet from an adjacent property line.
2. The native vegetation area shall cover no more than 50% of the subject property. Native vegetation areas covering 5% or less of the subject property shall not be subject to the provisions of this section.

Five Rivers MetroParks (Dayton-Montgomery County Park District) shall be the final arbiter regarding the identification of any plants in a natural landscaping area.
C. Unless a valid zoning certificate is held for a natural landscaping area, all other applicable regulations regarding maintenance of vegetation shall apply to the subject property. This section is not intended to pre-empt the Board of Trustees' powers described in Section 505.87 of the Revised Code of the State of Ohio.
SECTION 45-A10 | LANDSCAPING DEFINITIONS.
A. Caliper: The diameter or thickness of the trunk of a nursery-grown tree as measured at six inches (6”) above the top of the root mass for calipers up to and including four inches (4”) in diameter and twelve inches (12”) above the top of the root mass for calipers greater than four inches (4”).
B. Deciduous Tree: Any tree that naturally loses its leaves in the Fall.
C. Diameter at breast height (DBH): The diameter of a tree measured at four and one-half feet above the existing grade at the base of the tree.
D. Diseased Tree: Tree weakened by disease, infestation, decay, age or fire, to an extent where there is a risk that the tree may die within five years, split, fall, threaten the viability of healthy trees; and the problem cannot be fixed or healed through normal horticultural practices.
E. Drip Line: A vertical line extending from the outermost branches of a tree to the ground.
F. Evergreen Tree: Any tree that does not naturally lose its leaves or needles in the Fall and remains green throughout the year.
G. Native Tree: Tree species and cultivated varieties originating from species that grew in Ohio or the eastern to central portions of North America prior to the importation
MIAMI TOWNSHIP ZONING RESOLUTION
ARTICLE 45-A – LANDSCAPING
Revised: March, 2006 – Res. 63-2006 45-A - 10
and/or transplantation of varieties from outside of North America.
H. Ornamental Trees: Trees planted primarily for their aesthetic qualities as opposed to the ability to provide a large degree of shade upon maturity. Examples of ornamental trees would be crab apple, cherry,
I. Tree Topping: The severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the tree’s crown to such a degree as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree.
J. Perennial Stream: A perennial stream is a flowing system continuously recharged by groundwater or surface runoff regardless of weather conditions. It exhibits well-defined geomorphological characteristics and in the absence of pollution, thermal modifications, or other man-made disturbances has the ability to support aquatic life. During hydrological drought conditions, the flow may be impaired.
K. Intermittent Stream: An intermittent stream is a flowing system under normal weather conditions. During the dry season and throughout minor drought periods, these streams will not exhibit flow. Geomorphological characteristics are not well defined and are often inconspicuous. In the absence of external limiting factors (pollution, thermal modifications, etc.), biology is scarce and adapted to the wet and dry conditions of the fluctuating water level.
L. Ephemeral Stream: An ephemeral stream is a short-lived system for carrying stormwater. Under normal conditions, these systems will not flow. The geomorphology is characteristic of flashy and erosive stormwater events. Biology is limited to terrestrial and upland species.

zoning certificate and/or occupancy certificate.
SECTION 4914 | HAZARD POTENTIAL RANKING SYSTEM.
In order to assess the risk for potential groundwater contamination, a hazard ranking has been developed for various activities categorized by their Standard Industrial activities categorized by their Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. This ranking is based on the kinds of materials commonly associated with each use looking only at the most critical hydrologic factors.
A. Table 1 - Hazard Potential by Land Use*
Table 1 lists the site hazard potential by land use activity on a scale of 1 - 9, with 1 being a low hazard and 9 a very high hazard. This rating is based on the intrinsic hazards posed by different land uses and is related to the materials commonly used or stored on the site or the types and amounts of wastes commonly discharged.
B. Table 2 - Hazard Potential by Material*
Table 2 lists the hazard potential determined on the basis of materials known to be used, stored, or disposed of at a specific site.
* If the two tables referenced above indicate different site hazard potential ratings for the SIC-coded land use activity and the materials found on-site, the higher of the two scores is the rating for the site.
