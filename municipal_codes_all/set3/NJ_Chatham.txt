described further in the appropriate section below).
A. LOSAP shall provide for fixed, annual contributions (with the ability to
increase for the cost of living, and increase as LOSAP caps are
increased) to a deferred income account for each active member of the
CES who meets the criteria set forth below. The criteria may be

Township Committee and Borough Council, the sponsoring agencies.
The program shall provide that points shall be granted for activities
designated by the sponsoring agencies, which activities may include the

A. Low/moderate split and bedroom distribution of affordable housing
units:
(1) The fair share obligation shall be divided equally between low- and
moderate-income units, except that where there is an odd number
of affordable housing units, the extra unit shall be a low income
unit. At least 13% of all restricted rental units shall be very lowincome
units. The very low-income units shall be counted as part of
the required number of low income units within the development.
(2) In each affordable development, at least 50% of the restricted units
within each bedroom distribution shall be low-income units.
(3) Affordable developments that are not age-restricted shall be
structured in conjunction with realistic market demands such that:
(a) The combined number of efficiency and one-bedroom units
shall be no greater than 20% of the total low- and moderateincome
units;
(b) At least 30% of all low- and moderate-income units shall be two
bedroom units;
(c) At least 20% of all low- and moderate-income units shall be
three bedroom units; and

such that the number of bedrooms shall equal the number of agerestricted
low- and moderate-income units within the inclusionary
development. This standard may be met by having all one-bedroom
units or by having a two-bedroom unit for each efficiency unit.
B. Accessibility requirements:
(1) The first floor of all restricted townhouse dwelling units and all
restricted units in all other multistory buildings shall be subject to
§ 69-6 SALARIES AND COMPENSATION § 69-7

the technical design standards of the Barrier Free Sub-Code,
N.J.A.C. 5:23-7 and the following.

or the casing for the installation of a door, on the first floor;
and
(e) If not all of the foregoing requirements in Subsections B(2)(a)
through B(2)(d) can be satisfied, then an interior accessible
route of travel must be provided between stories within an
individual unit, but if all of the terms of Subsections B(2)(a)
through B(2)(d) above have been satisfied, then an interior
accessible route of travel shall not be required between stories
within an individual unit; and
(f) An accessible entranceway as set forth at P.L. 2005, c. 350
(N.J.S.A. 52:27D-311a et seq.) and the Barrier Free Sub-Code,
N.J.A.C. 5:23-7, or evidence that the Borough has collected
funds from the developer sufficient to make 10% of the
adaptable entrances in the development accessible:
[1] Where a unit has been constructed with an adaptable
entrance, upon the request of a disabled person who is
purchasing or will reside in the dwelling unit, an
accessible entrance shall be installed.
[2] To this end, the builder of restricted units shall deposit
funds within the Borough's Affordable Housing Trust Fund
sufficient to install accessible entrances in 10% of the
affordable units that have been constructed with
adaptable entrances.
[3] The funds deposited above shall be used by the Borough
for the sole purpose of making the adaptable entrance of
an affordable unit accessible when requested to do so by a
person with a disability who occupies or intends to occupy
the unit and requires an accessible entrance.
[4] The developer of the restricted units shall submit a design
plan and cost estimate to the Construction Official of the
Borough for the conversion of adaptable to accessible
entrances.
§ 69-7 CHATHAM CODE § 69-7

[5] Once the Construction Official has determined that the
design plan to convert the unit entrances from adaptable
to accessible meet the requirements of the Barrier Free
Sub-Code, N.J.A.C. 5:23-7, and that the cost estimate of
such conversion is reasonable, payment shall be made to
the Borough's Affordable Housing Trust Fund in care of
the Borough Treasurer who shall ensure that the funds are
deposited into the Affordable Housing Trust Fund and
appropriately earmarked.
(g) Full compliance with the foregoing provisions shall not be
required where an entity can demonstrate that it is site
impracticable to meet the requirements. Determinations of site
impracticability shall be in compliance with the Barrier Free
Sub-Code, N.J.A.C. 5:23-7.
C. Design:

moderate-income ownership units must be available for at least
three different sales prices for each bedroom type, and low-income

the purchase price and the Federal Reserve H.15 rate of interest),
taxes, homeowner and private mortgage insurance and
condominium or homeowner association fees do not exceed 28% of

nonrestricted, fair market value of the unit based on either an appraisal
or the unit's equalized assessed value without the restrictions in place.
D. At the time of the initial sale of the unit, the initial purchaser shall
execute and deliver to the administrative agent a recapture note

B. After providing written notice of a violation to an owner, developer or
tenant of a low- or moderate-income unit and advising the owner,
developer or tenant of the penalties for such violations, the municipality
may take the following action(s) against the owner, developer or tenant
for any violation that remains uncured for a period of 60 days after
service of the written notice:
(1) The municipality may file a court action pursuant to N.J.S.A.
2A:58-11 alleging a violation or violations of the regulations
§ 69-20 SALARIES AND COMPENSATION § 69-21
56:97
governing the affordable housing unit. If the owner, developer or
tenant is adjudged by the court to have violated any provision
of the regulations governing affordable housing units, the owner,
developer or tenant shall be subject to one or more of the following
penalties, at the discretion of the court:
(a) A fine of not more than $500 per day or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed 90 days, or both, provided that each and
every day that the violation continues or exists shall be
considered a separate and specific violation of these provisions
and not a continuation of the initial offense;
(b) In the case of an owner who has rented a low- or moderateincome
unit in violation of the regulations governing affordable
housing units, payment into the Borough affordable housing
trust fund of the gross amount of rent illegally collected;
(c) In the case of an owner who has rented a low- or moderateincome
unit in violation of the regulations governing affordable
housing units, payment of an innocent tenant's reasonable
relocation costs, as determined by the court.
(2) The municipality may file a court action in the Superior Court
seeking a judgment that would result in the termination of the
owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a
mortgage foreclosure. Any such judgment shall be enforceable as if
the same were a judgment of default of the first purchase money
mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the low- or moderateincome
unit.
(a) The judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the
municipality, by means of an execution sale by the sheriff, at
which time the low- and moderate-income unit of the violating
owner shall be sold at a sale price which is not less than the
amount necessary to fully satisfy and pay off any first purchase
money mortgage and prior liens and the costs of the
enforcement proceedings incurred by the municipality,
including attorney's fees. The violating owner shall have his
right to possession terminated as well as his title conveyed
pursuant to the sheriff's sale.
(b) The proceeds of the sheriff's sale shall first be applied to satisfy
the first purchase money mortgage lien and any prior liens
upon the low- and moderate-income unit. The excess, if any,
shall be applied to reimburse the municipality for any and all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with either the
court action resulting in the judgment of violation or the
sheriff's sale. In the event that the proceeds from the sheriff's
sale are insufficient to reimburse the municipality in full as
aforesaid, the violating owner shall be personally responsible
for the full extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and all
§ 69-21 CHATHAM CODE § 69-21
56:98
costs incurred by the municipality in connection with collecting
such deficiency. In the event that a surplus remains after
satisfying all of the above, such surplus, if any, shall be placed
in escrow by the municipality for the owner and shall be held
in such escrow for a maximum period of two years or until
such earlier time as the owner shall make a claim with the
municipality for such. Failure of the owner to claim such
balance within the two-year period shall automatically result
in a forfeiture of such balance to the municipality. Any interest
accrued or earned on such balance while being held in escrow
shall belong to and shall be paid to the municipality, whether
such balance shall be paid to the owner or forfeited to the
municipality.
(c) Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the
regulations governing affordable housing units shall not
extinguish the restrictions of the regulations governing
affordable housing units as the same apply to the low- and
moderate-income unit. Title shall be conveyed to the purchaser
at the sheriff's sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions of
the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. The
owner determined to be in violation of the provisions of this
plan and from whom title and possession were taken by means
of the sheriff's sale shall not be entitled to any right of
redemption.
(d) If there are no bidders at the sheriff's sale, or if insufficient
amounts are bid to satisfy the first purchase money mortgage
and any prior liens, the municipality may acquire title to the
low- and moderate-income unit by satisfying the first purchase
money mortgage and any prior liens and crediting the violating
owner with an amount equal to the difference between the first
purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and costs of the
enforcement proceedings, including legal fees and the
maximum resale price for which the low- and moderate-income
unit could have been sold under the terms of the regulations
governing affordable housing units. This excess shall be
treated in the same manner as the excess which would have
been realized from an actual sale as previously described.
(e) Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold
at the sheriff's sale or acquired by the municipality shall
obligate the owner to accept an offer to purchase from any
qualified purchaser which may be referred to the owner by the
municipality, with such offer to purchase being equal to the
maximum resale price of the low- and moderate-income unit as
permitted by the regulations governing affordable housing
units.
(f) The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable
for complying with the terms and restrictions of governing

(1990), the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory
development fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985 (the
"Act"), N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et seq., and the State Constitution, subject
to the Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH's) adoption of rules.
B. Pursuant to P.L. 2008, c.46 section 8 (N.J.S.A. 52:27D-329.2) and the
Statewide Nonresidential Development Fee Act (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.1
through 40:55D-8.7), COAH is authorized to adopt and promulgate
regulations necessary for the establishment, implementation, review,
monitoring and enforcement of municipal affordable housing trust
funds and corresponding spending plans. Municipalities that are under
the jurisdiction of the Council or court of competent jurisdiction and
have a COAH-approved spending plan may retain fees collected from
nonresidential development.
C. This chapter establishes standards for the collection, maintenance, and
expenditure of development fees pursuant to COAH's regulations and in
accordance with P.L. 2008, c.46, Sections 8 and 32 through 38. Fees
collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used for the sole purpose of
providing low- and moderate-income housing. This chapter shall be
interpreted within the framework of COAH's rules on development fees,
codified at N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.
§ 115-2 CHATHAM CODE § 119-2
115:128
§ 119-3. Definitions.
The following terms, as used in this chapter, shall have the following
meanings:

Housing Element and Fair Share Plan, and includes, but is not limited to,
an inclusionary development, a municipal construction project or a onehundred-
percent-affordable development.
COAH or the COUNCIL  The New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing
established under the Act which has primary jurisdiction for the
administration of housing obligations in accordance with sound regional
planning consideration in the state.
DEVELOPER  The legal or beneficial owner or owners of a lot or of any
land proposed to be included in a proposed development, including the
holder of an option or contract to purchase, or other person having an

GREEN BUILDING STRATEGIES  Those strategies that minimize the
impact of development on the environment, and enhance the health, safety
and well-being of residents by producing durable, low-maintenance,

§ 119-4. Residential development fees.
A. This chapter shall not be effective until approved by COAH pursuant to
N.J.A.C. 5:96-5.1.
B. The Borough of Chatham shall not spend development fees until COAH
has approved a plan for spending such fees in conformance with
N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.10 and N.J.A.C. 5:96-5.3.
A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all residential zoning district(s), residential developers,
except for developers of the types of development specifically
exempted below, shall pay a fee of 1.5% of the equalized assessed
value for residential development, provided no increased density is
permitted.
(2) When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70d(5) (known as a "d" variance) has been permitted,
developers may be required to pay a development fee of 6% of the
§ 119-2 COOPERATIVE AND CONDOMINIUM § 119-4
115:129
§ 119-5. Nonresidential development fees.
equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be
realized. However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the
two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application,
the base density for the purposes of calculating the bonus
development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right
during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance
application. Example: If an approval allows four units to be
constructed on a site that was zoned for two units, the fees could
equal 1.5% of the equalized assessed value on the first two units;
and the specified higher percentage up to 6% of the equalized
assessed value for the two additional units, provided zoning on
the site has not changed during the two-year period preceding the
filing of such a variance application.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for residential
development.
(1) Affordable housing developments, developments where the
developer is providing for the construction of affordable units
elsewhere in the municipality, and developments where the
developer has made a payment in lieu of on-site construction of
affordable units shall be exempt from development fees.
(2) Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan
approval prior to the adoption of a municipal development fee
ordinance shall be exempt from development fees, unless the
developer seeks a substantial change in the approval. Where a site
plan approval does not apply, a zoning and/or building permit shall
be synonymous with preliminary or final site plan approval for this
purpose. The fee percentage shall be vested on the date that the
building permit is issued.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure undergoes a change to a more intense use, is demolished
and replaced, or is expanded, if the expansion is not otherwise
exempt from the development fee requirement. The development
fee shall be calculated on the increase in the equalized assessed
value of the improved structure.
(4) Developers of developments with one or two owner-occupied
dwelling units; and residential structures demolished and replaced
as a result of fire, flood, or natural disaster, shall be exempt from
paying a development fee.
A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all zoning districts, nonresidential developers, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted, shall
pay a fee equal to 2.5% of the equalized assessed value of the land
§ 119-4 CHATHAM CODE § 119-5
115:130
and improvements, for all new nonresidential construction on an
unimproved lot or lots.
(2) Nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types of
development specifically exempted, shall also pay a fee equal to
2.5% of the increase in equalized assessed value resulting from any
additions to existing structures to be used for nonresidential
purposes.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure is demolished and replaced. The development fee of 2.5%
shall be calculated on the difference between the equalized
assessed value of the preexisting land and improvement and the
equalized assessed value of the newly improved structure, i.e., land
and improvement, at the time final certificate of occupancy is
issued. If the calculation required under this section results in a
negative number, the nonresidential development fee shall be zero.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for
nonresidential development.
(1) The nonresidential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or market
rate development shall be subject to the development fee of 2.5%
unless otherwise exempted below.
(2) The fee of 2.5% shall not apply to an increase in equalized assessed
value resulting from alterations, change in use within existing
footprint, reconstruction, renovations and repairs.
(3) Nonresidential developments shall be exempt from the payment of
nonresidential development fees in accordance with the
exemptions required pursuant to P.L. 2008, c.46, as specified in the
Form N-RDF, State of New Jersey Non-Residential Development
Certification/Exemption form. Any exemption claimed by a
developer shall be substantiated by that developer.
(4) A developer of a nonresidential development exempted from the
nonresidential development fee pursuant to P.L. 2008, c.46 shall be
subject to it at such time the basis for the exemption no longer
applies, and shall make the payment of the nonresidential
development fee, in that event, within three years after that event
or after the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy of the
nonresidential development, whichever is later.
(5) If a property which was exempted from the collection of a
nonresidential development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt
from property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit the
fees required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the
termination of the property tax exemption. Unpaid nonresidential
development fees under these circumstances may be enforceable
by the Borough of Chatham as a lien against the real property of
the owner.

115:131
§ 119-6. Collection procedures.

ARTICLE I
Affordable Housing Fees
[Adopted 5-11-1998 by Ord. No. 8-98 (Ch. 69 of the 1975 Code)]
§ 129-1. Purpose.
In Holmdel Builder's Association vs. Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550 (1990),
the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory development
fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985, N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et
seq., and the State Constitution, subject to the imposition of rules by COAH.
The purpose of this article is to establish standards for the collection,
maintenance and expenditure of development fees pursuant to COAH'S
adopted rules. Fees collected pursuant to this article shall be used for the
sole purpose of providing low- and moderate-income housing. This article
shall be interpreted within the framework of COAH's rules on development
fees.
§ 129-2. Definitions.
The following definitions shall control:
BOROUGH  Shall refer to the Borough of Chatham.[Added 3-28-2005 by
Ord. No. 05-04]
COAH  The New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing.
DEVELOPMENT FEES  Money paid by an individual, person, partnership,
association, company or corporation for the improvement of property as
permitted in COAH's rules.
EQUALIZED ASSESSED VALUE  The value of a property determined by
the Municipal Tax Assessor through a process designed to ensure that all
property in the municipality is assessed at the same assessment ratio or
ratios required by law. Estimates at the time of issuance of a building permit
may be obtained by the Tax Assessor utilizing estimates for construction
cost. Final equalized assessed value will be determined at project
completion by the Municipal Tax Assessor.
SUBSTANTIVE CERTIFICATION  A determination of COAH approving a
municipality's housing element and fair share plan in accordance with the
provisions of the Act and the rules and criteria as set forth herein. A grant of
substantive certification shall be valid for a period of six years in accordance
with the terms and conditions contained therein.
§ 129-3. Determination of fees. [Amended 3-28-2005 by Ord. No.
05-04]
A. Residential zones.
(1) In all residential zones, a developer shall pay residential
development fees which will be a maximum of 1.5% of the
equalized assessed value for residential development, the coverage
of the homeowner warranty document of a for-sale unit or the
§ 129-1 DRUG-FREE ZONES § 129-3
122:141
appraised value on the document utilized for construction financing
for a rental unit, provided that no increased density is permitted.
[Amended 11-24-2008 by Ord. No. 08-24]
(2) When the Borough approves an increase in residential density
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d(5) (known as a d variance), the
Borough may impose a development fee upon the developer of up
to 6% of either the equalized assessed value for each additional
unit that may be realized, the coverage amount on the homeowner
warranty document for each additional for-sale unit or the
appraised value on the document utilized for construction financing
for each additional rental unit. (Example: If an approval allows four
units to be constructed on a site that was zoned for two units, the
fees could equal 1% of either the equalized assessed value, the
coverage amount on the homeowner warranty document or the
appraised value on the document utilized for construction financing
on the first two units; and 6% of either the equalized assessed
value, the coverage amount on the homeowner warranty document
or the appraised value on the document utilized for construction
financing for the two additional units.) However, if the zoning on a
site has changed during the two-year period preceding the filing of
such a variance application, the density for the purposes of
calculating the bonus development fee shall be the highest density
permitted by right during the two-year period preceding the filing
of the variance application.
B. Nonresidential zones.
(1) In all nonresidential zones, a developer shall pay nonresidential
development fees which shall be 2.5% of either the equalized
assessed value for nonresidential development or the appraised
value. The Borough may also utilize any recognized industry
standard to establish values of nonresidential development that is
acceptable to both the Borough and COAH. [Amended
11-24-2008 by Ord. No. 08-24]
(2) When the Borough approves an increase in floor area pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d (4) (known as a d variance), the Borough may
impose a development fee of up to 6% on the additional floor area
realized. However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the
two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application,
the base floor area for the purposes of calculating the bonus
development fee shall be the highest floor area permitted by right
during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance
application.
(3) The imposition of payments in lieu of development fees pursuant to
a development fee ordinance approved by COAH pursuant to
N.J.A.C. 5:93-8 shall not be construed as a condition of preliminary
or final site plan approval or as a stipulation included in a

calculated at the certificate of occupancy and the amount paid at
building permit.

necessary to implement the Borough of Chatham's housing element.
The expenditure of all money shall conform to a spending plan approved
by COAH.
B. At least 30% of the revenues collected shall be devoted to render units
more affordable. Examples of such activities include, but are not limited
to, down payment assistance, low interest loans and rental assistance.
C. No more than 20% of the revenues collected from development fees
shall be expended on administration, including but not limited to

element; and an affirmative marketing program.

GENERAL REFERENCES
Environmental Commission  See Ch. 11.

§ 130-1. Purpose.
A chapter to regulate the outdoor application of fertilizer so as to reduce
the overall amount of excess nutrients entering waterways, thereby helping
to protect and improve surface water quality.
§ 130-2. Basis and background.
Elevated levels of nutrients, particularly phosphorus, in surface water
bodies can result in excessive and accelerated growth of algae and aquatic
plants (eutrophication). Excessive plant growth can result in diurnal
variations and extremes in dissolved oxygen and pH, which, in turn, can
be detrimental to aquatic life. As algae and plant materials die off, the
decay process creates a further demand on dissolved oxygen levels. The
presence of excessive plant matter can also restrict use of the affected
water for recreation and water supply. While healthy vegetated areas are
protective of water quality by stabilizing soil and filtering precipitation,
when fertilizers are applied to the land surface improperly or in excess of
the needs of target vegetation, nutrients can be transported by means of
stormwater to nearby waterways, contributing to the problematic growth
of excessive aquatic vegetation. Most soils in New Jersey contain sufficient
amounts of phosphorus to support adequate root growth for established
turf. Over time, it is necessary to replenish available phosphorus, but
generally not at the levels commonly applied. Other target vegetation, such
as vegetable gardens and agricultural/horticultural plantings, will have a
greater need for phosphorus application, as will the repair or establishment
of new lawns or cover vegetation. A soils test and fertilizer application
recommendation geared to the soil and planting type is the best means
to determine the amount of nutrients to apply. Timing and placement of
fertilizer application is also critical to avoid transport of nutrients to
waterways through stormwater runoff. Fertilizer applied immediately prior
to a runoff-producing rainfall, outside the growing season or to impervious
surfaces is most likely to be carried away by means of runoff without
accomplishing the desired objective of supporting target vegetation growth.
Therefore, the management of the type, amount and techniques for
fertilizer application is necessary as one tool to protect water resources.

amended 5-10-2004 by Ord. No. 04-12]
(1) Disturbance of steep slopes. Throughout the R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4
Zones, portions of any lot having a predevelopment slope of 25% or
more shall remain undisturbed; not more than 1/5 of the portions of
any lot having a predevelopment slope of 20% or more but less than
25% shall be disturbed; and not more than 2/5 of the portions of
any lot having a predevelopment slope of 15% or more but less than
20% shall be disturbed.
(2) Lots with limited allowable land disturbance. If the provisions of
Subsection G(1) above limit the total area of allowable land
disturbance on a lot existing as of the effective date of this
subsection to 3,000 square feet or less, development of the lot shall
be permitted only as a conditional use, subject to compliance with
the conditional use requirements of § 165-141 and all requirements
of this section other than Subsection G(1).
(3) Building height in areas of excessive slope. Where relief is granted
from Subsection G(1) above to locate a building wholly or partly on
a predevelopment slope of 25% or more, building height shall be
measured in accordance with the definition of "building, height of"
in § 165-10, provided that the uphill elevation of the building shall
not exceed 1 1/2 stories and shall be not more than 16.5 feet in
height measured from the finished grade, and further provided that
the elevation of the front entry floor level shall be not more than
three feet higher or lower than the average elevation of the street
frontage of the lot or, in the case of a corner lot, not more than
three feet higher or lower than the elevation at the intersection of
the street lines, but in no case shall the elevation of the front entry
floor level be required to be below the elevation of the street the
house faces.
(4) Redevelopment in areas of excessive slope. Where a lot containing
slopes of 25% or more, which slopes have already been developed
or disturbed, is proposed to be redeveloped, the elevation of the
front entry floor level of the new dwelling shall not be higher or
lower relative to the street level than the elevation of the front
entry floor level of the dwelling that is being replaced.
§ 165-14 CHATHAM CODE § 165-14
154:284
(5) Front yard setback. Where appropriate, and as a means of limiting
the extent of disturbance of steep slopes, the Board may grant a
reduction in the required front yard.
(6) Appearance of buildings. Buildings constructed or partly
constructed on any slope of 15% or more shall present a finished
appearance on all sides of the building to within two feet of the
finished grade at the foundation. The achievement of a finished
appearance shall be through a combination of exterior building
materials, fenestration, fencing and trim.
(7) Disturbance of required rear and side yards. No land disturbance
shall be permitted within a required rear yard or in any portion of a
required side yard located behind the front building line.
(8) Grading and stormwater management plan required; retaining
walls; soil erosion and sedimentation.
(a) Where disturbance of predevelopment slopes of 15% or more
will exceed applicable limits set forth in Subsection G(1) above,
a proposed grading and stormwater management plan for the
lot shall be submitted to the Borough Engineer for review and
approval prior to the issuance of a construction permit.
(b) Stormwater runoff shall be controlled so as to result in zero net
increase in both the volume and the rate of runoff from the site
relative to predevelopment conditions both during and after
disturbance and at all times thereafter and to comply with all
current Borough and state regulations. The stormwater
management plan shall include plans for maximizing recharge
through the construction of dry wells, rain gardens and other
infiltration facilities and may include provisions for the
collection and use of rainwater for lawn and garden watering
and other approved purposes.
(c) Where structural retaining walls are proposed to be used to
limit disturbance of steep slopes, to control drainage and to
prevent soil erosion, they shall comply with setback
requirements and other applicable Borough regulations and
shall require a construction permit. No individual retaining
wall shall exceed six feet in height, measured from the toe of
the wall to the top of the wall. Where there is a need for a
structural retaining wall greater than six feet in height, the
wall shall be constructed in sections of not more than six feet in
height each and shall be designed and spaced as recommended
by the Construction Official in consultation with the Borough
Engineer to ensure the stability of the construction.
(d) All structural retaining walls shall be landscaped on the
downhill side to mitigate the potential visual impact of the wall
structure(s) on neighboring properties, and the proposed
landscaping shall be reviewed by the Borough Engineer and, if
§ 165-14 GARAGE SALES § 165-14
154:285
the Borough Engineer or the Board so recommends, by a
landscape architect retained by the Board to ensure that the
root system of any proposed landscaping will not undermine
the long-term stability of the retaining wall and that the
proposed landscaping will be viable and will achieve its
aesthetic purpose.
(e) The location and design of any proposed structural retaining
wall(s) shall be shown on the proposed grading and
stormwater management plan for the lot, which shall be
subject to review and approval by the Borough Engineer.
(f) Measures shall be instituted to prevent soil erosion and
sedimentation due to land disturbance activities, and such
measures shall be in operation during all stages of the
development. The specific methods to be utilized to prevent
soil erosion and sedimentation both during and after
construction shall be shown on the grading and stormwater
management plan.
(g) The smallest practicable area of land shall be exposed at any
one time during development. To that end, work shall be
undertaken in discrete stages so as to minimize the extent and
duration of exposed soil at any one time, and the proposed
staging plan shall be subject to review as part of the grading
and stormwater management plan. All stripping of vegetation,
grading or other soil disturbance shall be undertaken in a
manner that will avoid soil erosion and sedimentation.
Sediment shall be required to be retained on the site. Sediment
basins, debris basins, desilting basins, or silt traps may be
required to be installed to remove sediment from runoff
waters. In addition, temporary seeding, mulching, plant cover
or other suitable stabilization measures shall be used to
protect exposed areas during construction and other land
disturbance activities.
(h) The construction or installation of soil erosion and sediment
control measures, such as diversions, sediment basins and
other such structures, shall occur prior to the start of any other
construction or on-site grading or land disturbance activities.
All soil erosion and sediment control measures required by this
subsection shall be maintained by the owner of the property
and by all successors in title until the Borough Engineer has
confirmed that the possibility of soil erosion and sedimentation
no longer exists.
(i) Where an applicant seeks approval of a conditional use
pursuant to § 165-141, the Board shall review and act upon the
proposed grading and stormwater management plan, based
upon the Borough Engineer's review and recommendations, as
part of its consideration of the conditional use application.
§ 165-14 CHATHAM CODE § 165-14
154:286
(9) Landscaping and revegetation plan.
(a) Where disturbance of predevelopment slopes of 15% or more
will exceed applicable limits set forth in Subsection G(1) above,
a proposed landscaping plan for the revegetation of the steep
slopes disturbed on the lot shall be submitted to the Board or
Borough Engineer, as the case may be. The landscaping plan
shall accompany the application for minor subdivision
approval, preliminary major subdivision approval or site plan
approval, or if none of these approvals are required, then the
application for a land disturbance permit. The landscaping
plan shall show the locations of all existing vegetative types,
including meadow, forest and scrub lands, and shall identify
the locations and area of each type of vegetation to be removed
and the locations and area of each type of vegetation to be
preserved. Wherever feasible, natural vegetation shall be
retained and protected.
(b) The landscaping plan shall also identify the proposed final
plant cover(s), and such plant cover(s), including lawns and
ground covers, shall be installed prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy. In the event that the final plant cover
cannot be installed because of weather conditions, the
installation thereof shall be enforced by appropriate provisions
in a bond or other surety and an improvement agreement. In
such case, temporary protective measures shall be installed in
accordance with the requirements of the Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey as promulgated
by the State Soil Conservation Committee and shall be
maintained until such time as the permanent protective
measures can be installed.
(c) The Board or Borough Engineer, as the case may be, may seek
the advice of a consultant landscape architect in reviewing the
landscaping plan.
(d) Where an applicant seeks approval of a conditional use
pursuant to § 165-141, the Board shall review and act upon the
proposed landscaping plan as part of its consideration of the
conditional use application.
(10) Conservation easements. Lands to be preserved as open space due
to the presence of steep slopes may be offered for dedication to the
municipality, a private land trust or a nonprofit agency in order to
preserve and maintain the area in its natural state. Portions of any
individual lot that are required to be left undisturbed by the terms
of this subsection are encouraged to be permanently protected by a
conservation easement in favor of the Borough of Chatham.

E. Gateway Overlay design standards.
(1) Applicability. These standards and guidelines shall be applicable to
any project requiring subdivision, variance, and/or site plan
approval. The design standards and guidelines shall be applied
concomitantly with the applicable use and bulk regulations of the
district, as well as with other standards within this chapter. The
general requirements of § 165-32 and the design standards in
§ 165-32.1 shall apply, along with the standards in this section.
Where the standards conflict, the more restrictive requirement
shall govern.
(2) Modifications and exceptions. Modifications or exceptions to the
design guidelines and standards contained in this section may be
approved by the Board, provided the applicant has met the criteria
for exceptions pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-51, and can provide
testimony that the resulting change will conform to all of the
following: satisfy the purpose and intent of this section; enhance
the development plan; and enhance the streetscape and
neighborhood.
(3) Gateway design standards.
(a) Context, continuity, massing and scale.
[1] In cases where there is no consistent pattern of
streetscape or buildings abutting a development
application or where that pattern is inconsistent with
these guidelines, the applicant is encouraged to view its
application as an opportunity to establish the future
context for the area.
[2] Buildings located at the borders or edges of the district
shall mark the transition into and out of the district in a
distinct fashion, using massing, height extensions,
contrasting materials and/or architectural embellishments
to obtain this effect.
[3] Focal points, or points of visual termination, shall
generally be occupied by structures with distinctive
architectural treatments. Applicants may also submit
plans in which building voids or natural features, such as a
plaza or a park, act as points of visual termination.
§ 165-30 CHATHAM CODE § 165-30
154:310
[4] The layout, materials and details used in the treatment of
exterior spaces shall be selected to enhance their
immediate surroundings. Exterior spaces shall be
functional and provide visual and/or physical amenities for
their users, including, but not limited to, textured paving,
landscaping, lighting, street trees, benches, bicycle racks,
trash receptacles and other items of street furniture, as
appropriate.
[5] When development consists of multiple structures,
buildings shall be oriented around open space, courtyard
or similar landscape/streetscape elements with the overall
design preserving existing trees, vegetation and grades to
the maximum extent possible.
[6] A minimum of two principal buildings per tract is required
for properties with two or more acres.
[7] Buildings' principal orientation shall be towards and relate
to public streets, both functionally and visually. Buildings
shall not be oriented to front parking lots.
[8] In a sequence of structures along a street, the spacing
between them (sidewall to sidewall) is an important
element in defining the observer's perception of rhythm.
New structures shall reflect the existing rhythm, or, in the
absence of a clear rhythm, shall better define it. In new
development, a sequence of structures shall seek to
establish a spacing rhythm that is related to the scale of
the individual buildings, their height, the composition of
the facade, and the width of the street.
[9] All buildings are required to incorporate frequent vertical
and horizontal articulation through slight variations in
build-to-lines, incorporation of front entries and porches,
variations in roof pitch, careful selection of materials, the
use of windowed projections, and similar architectural
treatments to improve the visual appearance of the
buildings. Vertical articulations shall be provided at least
every 30 feet along all facades that exceed 60 feet in
length or width.
(b) Building orientation and architectural treatment.
[1] A diversity of architectural styles adds interest to a
streetscape or district. No particular architectural style is
preferred outside of local historic districts, and both
contemporary contributions and reinterpretations of older
architectural styles with a contemporary flavor may be
acceptable. However, a diversity of appearance in facades
shall be counterbalanced with continuity in massing, wall
line, verticality, and spacing.
§ 165-30 GARAGE SALES § 165-30
154:311
[2] In rehabilitations of older buildings in the district,
distinctive stylistic features or characteristic examples of
skilled craftsmanship shall be treated with sensitivity. If
deteriorated, these architectural features shall be restored
rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event
replacement is necessary, the new material shall match
that being replaced in composition, design, color, texture
and other visual qualities, to the maximum extent possible.
(c) Multiple uses, ground floor retail emphasis, and/or storefronts.
[1] Storefronts, display windows and other ground floor
openings shall be accentuated through fenestration and
architectural treatment. Storefronts shall maintain
consistency with upper floors in terms of composition,
materials, style and detailing.
[2] Ground floor display windows shall be oriented to the
public street rather than designed with an inward, internal
orientation.
[3] Retail sales and service uses shall have large pane display
windows on the ground level. Such windows shall be
framed by the surrounding wall.
[4] The maximum size of a ground floor retail trade, retail
service or food service establishment shall not exceed
6,500 square feet of gross floor area.
[5] Solid metal security gates or solid roll-down metal
windows are prohibited.
(d) Fenestration.
[1] Fenestration shall be architecturally compatible with the
style, materials, colors and detail of a building. Windows
shall be vertically proportioned wherever possible. To the
extent possible, the location of windows on the upper
stories of a building shall be vertically aligned with the
location of windows and doors on the ground level,
including storefronts or display windows.
[2] In buildings designed in an architectural style that
normally has windows with muntins or divided lights,
these shall be required, and they must be externally
attached on both sides on the ground floor level.
[3] Windows shall be required at ground floor level with total
fenestration at ground level a minimum of 60% along all
exposed facades.
(e) Materials, colors, roofs and building details.
§ 165-30 CHATHAM CODE § 165-30
154:312
[1] All building facades shall be treated as front facades.
[2] The selection of building design elements, such as
materials, color and texture, should be compatible with the
building's style and with those details that prevail in the
Borough. Exterior building materials shall be selected to
convey a sense of dignity and permanence to the building.
Natural materials and natural colors are preferred except
in cases where architectural style dictates a more varied
color scheme. Clapboard siding, cedar shingles, Hardie
plank, stone, or brick shall be the primary exterior
material.
[3] The use of metal or glazed curtain walls, Dryvit panels,
mirrored and/or heavily tinted glass, plastic panels, thin
veneers, exposed concrete block, aluminum or vinyl siding
or other artificial materials as exterior building materials
are prohibited.
[4] The type, shape, pitch, texture and color of a roof shall be
considered as an integral part of the design of a building
and shall be architecturally compatible with the building's
style, materials, colors and details. Flat roofs are
permitted on buildings of a minimum of two stories in
height, provided all visibly exposed walls have an
articulated cornice that projects out horizontally from the
vertical building wall plane. Hip or gable roofs are
permitted where appropriate to the building type and
compatible with the surrounding area. Other types of roofs
are permitted if appropriate to the building's architecture.
[5] Architectural embellishments that add visual interest to
roofs, such as dormers, belvederes, masonry chimneys,
cupolas, clock towers and other similar elements are
encouraged, provided they are architecturally compatible
with the building.
[6] Green or vegetative roofs are strongly encouraged as is
the incorporation of any type of rooftop landscaping
features.
[7] Awnings and canopies. Fixed or retractable awnings are
permitted at ground floor level, and on upper levels where
appropriate, provided they complement a building's
architectural style, are compatible with its materials,
colors and details, and are not internally illuminated.
Canvas is the preferred material, although other
waterproofed fabrics may be considered. Metal,
aluminum, or vinyl awnings, as well as waterfall-type
awnings, are prohibited. Awnings shall not be placed so as
to conceal any significant architectural feature or detail,
§ 165-30 GARAGE SALES § 165-30
154:313
and particular attention shall be taken with selection of
the appropriate supporting structure and hardware, as
well as with the location and method by which it is
attached to the building facade. Ground-mounted supports
are prohibited. In buildings with multiple storefronts,
compatible awnings should be used as a means of unifying
the structure.
(f) Parking and access.
[1] Site plans shall balance the functional requirements of
parking with the provision of pedestrian amenities.
Transition areas between parking and commercial or
residential uses shall be designed with textured paving,
appropriate pedestrian walkways and crosswalk
treatment, landscaping and street furniture to clearly
demarcate pedestrian flows and to protect pedestrian
safety.
[2] Parking lot layout and orientation of parking with respect
to proposed buildings shall reflect pedestrian needs,
accessibility, and safety.
[3] Parking lot layout, landscaping, buffering and screening
shall prevent direct views of parked vehicles by the public,
minimize spill-over light, glare, noise or exhaust fumes
onto adjacent properties, in particular residential
properties, and provide the parking area with a reasonable
measure of shade.
[4] The interior of all parking lots shall be landscaped to
provide shade and visual relief. A minimum of one
deciduous shade tree shall be planted for every 10 parking
spaces.
(g) Streetscape elements, lighting, walls and fences, signage and
utilities.
[1] Elements of street furniture, such as benches, waste
containers, planters, bicycle racks and bollards should be
carefully selected to ensure compatibility with the
character of the area and the site. Consistency in the
location of the various elements of street furniture is
critical, for maximum effect and functional usage.
[2] Walkway design, including sidewalks, shall promote
pedestrian activity and safety within each site and
throughout the district; walkways shall be separate and
distinct from motor vehicle circulation, provide a pleasant
route for users, and promote pedestrian safety. Walkways
shall be constructed of brick, slate, colored/textured
concrete pavers or slabs, or some combination thereof that
§ 165-30 CHATHAM CODE § 165-30
154:314
is compatible with the style, materials, colors and details
of the surrounding buildings.
[3] Lighting fixtures shall be compatible with the building's
style and shall be concealed through shielding or installed
behind features to eliminate glare and spillage.
[4] Pedestrian-scaled lights shall be provided along public
street frontages and along interior pedestrian pathways.
No freestanding lights in parking areas (base plus pole)
shall exceed 16 feet in height. Pedestrian lighting shall not
exceed 12 feet tall (base plus pole).
[5] No fences or gates across access drives shall be permitted.
Fencing along the perimeter of rear and side yards shall
not exceed six feet in height. Walls and fences shall be
made of durable materials, and shall be compatible in
style, materials and color with buildings. Brick walls with a
stone or cast-stone cap are encouraged. Board-on-boardtype
wooden fences, with reinforced corners and entrance
poles, are permitted in rear and side yards only. Chain-link,
split-rail, highway-style guardrail, stockade or
contemporary security fencing such as barbed wire or
razor wire is prohibited. Landscaping and creative use of
materials are encouraged to improve the appearance of
walls.
[6] Master signage plans are required per § 165-104. Signs
affixed to the exterior of a building shall be architecturally
compatible with the style, composition, materials, colors
and details of the building. Signs shall not interfere with
door and window openings, conceal any architectural
details or obscure the composition of the facade where
they are located. Wood and painted metal are the
preferred materials for signs. Sign colors should be limited
in number and compatible with the colors of the building
facade and of nearby signs. Internally illuminated signs,
including backlit channel lettering affixed directly to a
building facade, are discouraged.
[7] Loading areas and their driveways shall be effectively
screened from adjacent properties and from the public
right-of-way through a combination of walls, fences and
landscaping. Screening and landscaping shall also
mitigate spillover glare, noise or exhaust fumes generated
by loading activities.
[8] All utilities (water, sewer, electric, phone, etc.) shall be
located underground.
F. Additional site plan/subdivision submission requirements. In addition to
the site plan, subdivision and variance checklist requirements, the

AFD-1, AFD-1.1, AFD-2, AFD-3 and AFD-4 Affordable Housing
Districts
[Added 2-8-1988 by Ord. No. 3-88; 9-23-2002 by Ord. No. 02-17]
§ 165-39. Purpose.
§ 165-40. Application procedure.
A. The purpose of the AFD-1, AFD-1.1, AFD-2, AFD-3 and AFD-4 Districts
is to encourage the development of certain vacant tracts in a manner
which incorporates the best features of design and relates the type,
design and layout of residential development to the particular site, and,
at the same time, provides the realistic opportunity for lower-income
housing to be constructed in accordance with the guidelines set forth in
the Fair Housing Act as interpreted by the Council on Affordable
Housing (COAH). These districts are intended to implement the
Borough's Fair Share Plan prepared in accordance with the COAH's
rules, which plan was adopted by the Borough Council and submitted
thereafter to the COAH. Special standards and procedures applicable to
these districts only are set forth herein to expedite the production of the
lower income housing. [Amended 9-23-2002 by Ord. No. 02-17;
6-22-2015 by Ord. No. 15-0852]
B. Recognizing that low- and moderate-income housing requires the
removal of standards which may be desirable to achieve but which may
also be cost generating to a developer of lower-income housing and
thereby inhibit its production, the guidelines set forth herein are
deemed, in connection with the initial construction of said low- and
moderate-income housing and the accompanying market value housing,
to be the minimum necessary for public health, safety and welfare.
[Amended 7-26-1999 by Ord. No. 10-99]
C. After completion of the low- and moderate-income housing and the
accompanying market value housing in a development to the
satisfaction of the appropriate Borough officials, when excessive cost as
an inhibitor of the development of lower-income housing is no longer a
factor, it is determined that the public good has been served by
providing a realistic opportunity for a fair share of the region's present
and prospective needs for low- and moderate-income families. It is
further determined that upon completion of a development as above
described, the public interest will be best served in the future by
making all relevant provisions of this chapter and the Municipal Land
Use Law (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.) applicable to the market value
dwellings in the development. [Added 7-26-1999 by Ord. No. 10-99]

ARTICLE IX
WHPA Well Head Protection Areas
[Added 3-8-2004 by Ord. No. 04-04]
§ 165-46. Statement of findings.
The Mayor and Council of the Borough of Chatham (the Borough) find that:
§ 165-47. Purpose.
The purpose of the addition of Article IX, hereinafter described as "this
article," to the Chatham Borough Land Development Ordinance, is to
protect the public health, safety and welfare through the protection of
the groundwater resources underlying the Borough to ensure a supply of
safe and healthful drinking water for the present and future generations
of local residents, employees and the general public in the Borough, as
A. The groundwater underlying the Borough is a major source of existing
and future water supplies, including drinking water. The groundwater
underlying the Borough lies within the Buried Valley Aquifer Systems of
the Central Passaic River Basin, which are designated as a "sole source"
aquifer under Section 1424(e) of the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act of
1974.
B. The groundwater aquifers are integrally connected with, are recharged
by, and flow into the surface waters, lakes and streams, which also
constitute a major source of water for drinking, commercial and
industrial needs.
C. Accidental spills and discharges of toxic and hazardous materials may
threaten the quality of these groundwater supplies and related water
sources.
D. Contaminated water from any source is a detriment to the health,
welfare and comfort of the residents of the Borough, and other users of
these water resources.
E. Spills or discharges of hazardous substances or hazardous wastes may
contaminate or pollute water. As a preventive measure, the proximity of
such materials to sources of water supplies, such as public community
wells, should be restricted so that there will be sufficient time to find
and clean up such spills or discharges before water supplies become
contaminated.
F. The Chatham Borough Planning Board, after careful consideration of
the need for well head protection in a form similar to the Model
Municipal Well Head Protection Ordinance (developed, with the
assistance of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection,
by the Passaic Valley groundwater Protection Committee of the Passaic
River Coalition), has amended the Borough Master Plan to include well
head protection area zoning.
§ 165-46 GARAGE SALES § 165-47
154:333
well as users of these water supplies outside the Borough. Areas of land
surrounding each public community well, known as Well Head Protection
Areas (WHPAs), from which contaminants may move through the ground to
be withdrawn in water taken from the well, have been delineated. Through
regulation of land use, physical facilities and other activities within these
areas, the potential for groundwater contamination can be reduced. The
purpose of the regulations contained in this article is to prevent the
migration of potential pollutants from areas within a WHPA into
groundwater that is withdrawn from a public community well.
§ 165-48. Statutory authority.
The Borough of Chatham is empowered to regulate these activities under
the provisions of the New Jersey Municipal Land Use Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1
et seq., which authorizes each municipality to plan and regulate land use
to secure a safe and adequate drinking water supply for its residents. The
Board of Health of the Borough has autonomous power granted by the
State Legislature to develop this article to protect public health, safety
and welfare, as set forth in the New Jersey Local Boards of Health Law,
N.J.S.A. 26:3-1 et seq., and the New Jersey County Environmental Health
Act, N.J.S.A. 26:3A2-21 et seq.

(1) A change to the interior of a building or structure; or
(2) A proposed exterior change to a building or structure which is not
visible from a public right-of-way; or
(3) Ordinary maintenance and repairs, as defined herein, to the
exterior of a structure.
B. Reports.
(1) The Commission shall prepare a Historic Preservation Review
Report with respect to the following types of applications for
permits:
(a) Demolition or removal. Any application for a permit to
demolish or remove a historic site or any improvement within a
historic district, or, if the applicant has demolished or removed
any such historic site without a permit, any application for a
§ 165-61 GARAGE SALES § 165-62
154:351
building permit to replace the demolished or removed
structure, must include detailed plans, including architectural
details, for any improvement which the applicant proposes
for the replacement of the said historic site or improvement.
The Commission may disapprove of but may not prohibit the
proposed demolition or removal. In its report, the Commission
shall include a review of the proposed replacement structure.
The Commission shall submit its report to the permitting
official; it shall be submitted within 45 days after the
permitting official's referral of the application to the
Commission. If, within the forty-five-day period, the
Commission recommends against the issuance of a building
permit or recommends conditions to the building permit to
be issued, the permitting official shall deny issuance of the
building permit or include the conditions in the permit, as the
case may be. Nothing herein shall prohibit an extension of time
by mutual agreement of the applicant, the Commission and
the Planning Board. Failure to report within the forty-five-day
period or any agreed upon extension period shall be deemed
to constitute a report in favor of issuance of the permit and
without the recommendation of conditions to the permit.
(b) Other applications requiring a report. The following
applications for issuance of permits pertaining to historic sites
or property in historic districts shall also require a historic
preservation review report:
[1] Applications which involve addition to or new construction
of a principal or accessory building or structure.
[2] Applications which involve a change in the exterior
appearance of any building, improvement, site, place or
structure by addition, reconstruction, alteration or
replacement. The exterior change must be visible from a
public right-of-way and is limited to character-defining
features. When considering applications involving changes
in exterior appearance, the Commission's report shall
contain advice and recommendations for the applicant in
regard to the appropriateness of the proposed action.
(2) The Commission shall submit its report, if any, to the Planning
Board. The Planning Board shall, within 45 days after the
permitting official's referral of the application to the Commission,
submit its written recommendations to the permitting official. If,
within the forty-five-day period, the Planning Board recommends
against the issuance of a permit or recommends conditions to the
permit to be issued, the Construction Official shall deny issuance of
the permit or include the conditions in the permit, as the case may
be. Nothing herein shall prohibit an extension of time by mutual
agreement of the applicant, the Commission and the Planning
Board. Failure to report within the forty-five-day period or any

§ 165-63. Design criteria and guidelines.
The design criteria and guidelines therefor contained in a document
prepared by the Chatham Borough Historic Preservation Commission
entitled A Design Guidelines Manual for Rehabilitation and New
Construction in the Main Street Historic District, dated 1994, are hereby
adopted for use by the Commission, the Planning Board, the Board of
Adjustment, and any other municipal official or body in evaluating any
matter before it involving a change in any property in the Main Street
Historic District.
§ 165-64. Emergency procedures.
agreed upon extension period shall be deemed to constitute a
report in favor of issuance of the permit and without the
recommendation of conditions to the permit.
C. Minor applications. In the case of a referral by the permitting official of
an application for a permit pertaining to historic sites or historic
districts which does not require a Historic Preservation Review Report,
it shall be considered a minor application for a permit pertaining to
historic sites or property in historic districts, as defined herein. The
Chairman or a subcommittee of the Commission may act in place of the
full Commission on a minor application. If the Chairman or the
subcommittee of the Commission determines that the proposed change
will substantially affect the characteristics of the historic site or historic
district, the Chairman or subcommittee may schedule the application
for a hearing before the full Commission. The Commission, Chairman or
subcommittee may then convey to the applicant, the permitting official
or the Planning Board, orally or in writing, any suggestions that the
Commission may have in connection with the historic preservation
aspects of the activity for which the applicant is seeking a permit. The
Commission or the Planning Board shall report to the permitting official
within 45 days after his referral of the application to the Commission.
A. When a structure or improvement requires immediate repair to
preserve the continued habitability of the structure and/or the health
and safety of its occupants or others, emergency repairs may be
performed in accordance with construction codes without first
obtaining a report from the Commission, or the Commission's advice.
Under such circumstances, the repairs performed shall be only such as
are necessary to protect the health and safety of the occupants of the
structure or others and/or maintain the habitability of the structure.
B. A request for the Commission's review shall be made simultaneously
with the onset of the emergency repairs. Such emergency work shall be
permitted only if the permitting official certifies the immediate
necessity for such permit issuance. Upon notice to one member of the
Commission by telephone, personal contact or other appropriate means
of communication, at least three members of the Commission shall

It shall be the duty of the permitting official to determine whether an
application for development involves any activity which should also be the
subject of an application to the Commission for review. If the permitting
official determines that the application is subject to review by the
Commission, then the permitting official shall so inform the applicant and
the Commission. If the permitting official is other than the administrative
officer, then the permitting official shall also inform the administrative
officer.

ARTICLE XI
Flood Damage Prevention
[Amended 12-14-1981 by Ord. No. 21-81; 8-10-1987 by Ord. No.
9-87; 9-9-1991 by Ord. No. 11-91; 2-8-1993 by Ord. No. 3-93;

Ord. No. 01-13]
§ 165-71. Statutory authorization; findings of fact; purpose;
objectives.
A. Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has
in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et seq., delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor
and Council of the Borough of Chatham, of New Jersey does ordain as
follows:
B. Findings of fact.
(1) The flood hazard areas of the Borough of Chatham are subject to
periodic inundation which results in danger to life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2) These flood losses are caused by increased stormwater flows due to
development, loss of wetlands to absorb flows, and the cumulative
effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which
increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately
anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately
floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.
C. Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed:
(1) To protect human life and health;
(2) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall
be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this article its most reasonable application.
APPEAL  A request for a review of the Construction Official's or Borough
Engineer's interpretation of any provision of this section or a request for a
flood variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a 1% or greater annual
chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable
and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by
ponding or sheet flow.
(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize
future flood blight areas;
(7) To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
(8) To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
D. Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purpose,
this article includes methods and provisions for:
(1) Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which
result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or
velocities;
(2) Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;
(3) Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or
channel floodwaters;
(4) Controlling, filling, grading, dredging, and other development
which may increase flood damage; and
(5) Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood
hazards in other areas.

154:365
(c) Those aggrieved by the decision of the Flood Appeal Board, or
any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Mayor and
Council of the Borough. Those aggrieved by the decision of the
Mayor and Council may appeal such decision to the Superior
Court of New Jersey, Law Division.
(d) In passing upon such applications, the Flood Appeal Board
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other portions of this article, and:
[1] The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands
to the injury of others;
[2] The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
[3] The susceptibility of the proposed structure and its
contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on
the individual owner;
[4] The importance of the services provided by the proposed
structure to the community;
[5] The necessity to the structure of a waterfront location,
where applicable;
[6] The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
[7] The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
[8] The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program of that area;
[9] The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
[10] The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of
wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
[11] The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical,
and water systems, and streets and bridges.
(e) Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D(1)(d) and the
purposes of this article, the Flood Appeal Board may attach

§ 165-75. Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
information, and report any flood variances to the Federal
Insurance Administration upon request.
(2) Conditions for variances.
(a) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing
the items in Subsection D(1)(d)[1] through [11] have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
(b) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure and the variance
is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
(c) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge
would result.
(d) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief.
(e) Variances shall only be issued upon:
[1] A showing of good and sufficient cause;
[2] A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
[3] A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as
identified in Subsection D(1)(d), or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
(f) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built
with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
§ 165-74 GARAGE SALES § 165-75
154:367
A. General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following
standards are required:
(1) Anchoring.
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of
the structure.
(b) All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties
to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting
wind forces.
(2) Construction materials and methods.
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to
flood damage.
(b) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood
damage.

(a) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the system;
(b) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharge from the systems into
floodwaters;
(c) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during
flooding; and
(d) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding.
(4) Subdivision proposals.
(a) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
(b) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems
located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
§ 165-75 CHATHAM CODE § 165-75
154:368
(c) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; and
(d) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for all subdivision
proposals.
(5) Enclosure openings. For all new construction and substantial
improvements that contain fully enclosed areas below the lowest
floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access
or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject
to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must
meet or exceed the following minimum criteria. A minimum of two
openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be
provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
or other covering or devices, provided that they permit the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
B. Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base
flood elevation data have been provided as set forth in § 165-73B, Basis
for establishing the areas of special flood hazard or in § 165-74C(2), Use
of other base flood and floodway data, the following standards are
required.
(1) Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated to or above base flood
elevation.
(2) Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential
structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to the level of the base flood elevation; or
(a) Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water;
(b) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
(c) Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance
with accepted standards of practice for meeting the applicable
provisions of this subsection. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in § 165-74C(3)(b).

§ 165-75A(1)(b).
(b) All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved
within an area of special flood hazard shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the top of the lowest floor is at
or above the base flood elevation.
C. Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§ 165-73B are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following
provisions apply:
(1) Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, are prohibited, unless a
technical evaluation demonstrates that encroachment shall not
result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
(2) If Subsection C(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements must comply with flood hazard reduction provisions
of § 165-75, Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
(3) In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation
data has been provided and no floodway has been designated, the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than
0.2 of a foot at any point.

chapter, additional land along either or both sides of said street,
sufficient to conform to the right-of-way requirements, shall be
dedicated for the location, installation, repair and maintenance of
streets, drainage facilities, utilities and other facilities customarily
located on street rights-of-way. The necessary deeds of ownership
shall be furnished, and the dedication shall be expressed as follows:
"Street right-of-way granted permitting the entrance upon these
lands for the purposes provided for and expressed in the Land
Development Ordinance of the Borough of Chatham." This
statement shall in no way reduce the developer's responsibility to
provide, install, repair or maintain the facilities in the area
dedicated by ordinance and/or as shown on the plan and/or as
provided for by any maintenance or performance guarantees. If the
development is along one side only, 1/2 of the required extra width
shall be dedicated. Additionally, that portion of the existing street
or road adjoining or included within a site plan or major subdivision
shall be improved, including excavation, grading, base courses and
surfacing in accordance with the road improvement standards of
this chapter.
(4) In all developments, the minimum public street right-of-way shall
be at least 50 feet measured from lot line to lot line, but in no case

extension of the street to the boundary of the adjoining property is
impractical or impossible) or of a temporary nature (where
provision is made for the future extension of the street to the
boundary line of adjoining property) shall be no more than 400 feet
on the curbline plus a utility and planting strip width of 10 feet
around the entire cul-de-sac for a total right-of-way radius of 50
feet. The center point for the radius shall be on the center line of

becomes tangent to the right curbline of the associated street.
(7) No street shall have a name which will duplicate or nearly duplicate
the name of an existing street that confusion results. The
continuation of an existing street shall have the same name.
Curvilinear streets shall change their names only at street
intersections. The Board shall reserve the right to approve or name
streets within a proposed development.

included in determining lot coverage. The water surface area of a
private swimming pool hereafter constructed or enlarged shall not
exceed 25% of the actual rear yard area, such rear yard area being
determined for this purpose by projecting the rear line of the
residence building to the side lines of the lot and determining the
area to the rear of that line. No part of the surface area of a private
swimming pool shall be closer than 20 feet to the rear line nor
closer than 20 feet to the side line. In all cases the pool shall be
located behind the rear line of the existing structures adjacent

to the premises upon which a private swimming pool is located, water
from the pool shall be emptied into such catch basin. Any permanent
connection to the municipal storm drain system shall be made only
upon permission of the Borough Administrator and under the
supervision of the Borough Engineer. No private swimming pool shall
be wholly or partially emptied into any sanitary sewer system, cesspool
or septic tank, nor in any manner that will create a hazard or nuisance
or cause surface water to flow upon the land of another or upon a public
road.
D. Fencing of private swimming pools. Every private swimming pool shall
be completely enclosed by a permanent substantial fence with a gate or
gates; these shall comply with Construction Code requirements, but in
any case they shall have a height of no less than four feet above ground
level. No aperture in such fence or any gate shall be more than three
inches in width. Such fence and any gate shall be so designed,
constructed and maintained as to prevent access to the pool by children
at any time except when the pool is in use under the supervision of the
possessor of the pool or by his permission. [Amended 12-11-1995 by
Ord. No. 17-95]
E. Artificial illumination. Any electric lights used in connection with a
private swimming pool shall be in full compliance with the provisions of
§ 165-78 of this chapter. [Amended 12-11-1995 by Ord. No. 17-95]

accompanied by a survey prepared by a licensed surveyor or engineer
on which the licensed professional has located the proposed pool and
certified that said location is accurate; the certification shall also set
forth the area of the rear yard and the area of the pool and its accessory
structures as calculated by the licensed professional. After completion

17-95]
Each nonresidential building shall provide at least one solid waste pickup
area, either within the building or outside the building in the rear yard
area. All outside locations shall be obscured from view from parking areas,
streets and adjacent districts by a fence, wall, planting or combination
of the three as approved by the Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment.
§ 165-90. Water supply.
Water mains shall be constructed in such a manner as to make adequate
water service available to each lot or building within the development. The
entire system shall be designed in accordance with the requirements and

included as part of a more extensive application, an application for a
building permit to disturb land will be filed with the Construction
Official accompanied by at least a written description and sketch
showing the land disturbance proposed.
C. Action on application. If the Construction Official finds, based on the
initial application, that no soil removal is involved, and that the
disturbance will not change the topography or drainage of the
premises, such as to affect drainage on a neighbor's property, and that
no violation of any other law or regulation is proposed, he shall issue a
permit upon payment of the appropriate fee. When the application

in conformity with the terms of the permit and the provisions of this
chapter on or before the date of completion set forth in the
application.
(2) That the applicant will repair any public street, sidewalk, right-ofway,
structure or land which may be damaged as a result of the
work authorized by the permit.65

§ 165-101 CHATHAM CODE § 165-102

§ 165-103. General permit procedures.
The following procedures shall govern the application for and issuance of all
sign permits and the submission and review of master signage plans under
this article:
(3) Internally illuminated signs shall not be permitted in the B-3 and
B-4 Districts. In all other districts, internally illuminated signs shall
illuminate only the lettering or a logo, and the background shall be
opaque or dark.
B. Design guidelines. To the maximum extent possible, signs shall adhere
to the following design guidelines:
(1) On buildings designed for commerce, signs should fit in the existing
features of the facade, such as when facade bands of decorative
moldings create natural frames for signs. Signs should be aligned
with signs on adjacent storefronts.
(2) On lots with buildings built as residences but now put to
commercial use:
(a) Freestanding signs are preferred. If a sign must be placed on
such a building, it should be limited to one small identification
panel at each entrance.
(b) In all zone districts, external illumination of signs is preferred.
(3) Identification of the business should be the only message on the
principal sign. Verbiage may include three of the following: the
business name, the street address, the telephone number, the
website address, a short product identifier, and/or a logo or
emblem. Secondary signs in windows or the front door may inform
about products sold or services rendered.
(4) Good legibility communicates a sign's message quickly and easily.
The clearer the type style, the more readily it will be understood.
(5) Color contrast greatly influences legibility. The strongest impact
occurs with a dark background, and a dark and muted background
helps a sign fit more naturally into older buildings, especially if the
sign's colors complement those of the building's materials.
(6) Signs painted on windows are more legible in pale paint or gold
leaf.
A. Applications for sign permits of any kind and applications for approval
of a master signage plan shall be submitted to the Borough Zoning
Official on an application form or in accordance with application
specifications published by the Borough Zoning Official.

§ 165-104. Master signage plan.
B. Fees. Each application for a sign permit or for approval of a master
signage plan shall be accompanied by the applicable fees, which shall
be established by the governing body of the Borough.
C. Completeness. Within 10 business days of receiving an application for a
sign permit, the Borough Zoning Official shall review it for
completeness. If the application is incomplete, the Borough Zoning
Official shall, within such ten-day period, send a notice to the applicant
setting forth the deficiencies in the application.
D. Action.
(1) Except as stated within this section, upon receipt of a complete
application, the sign permit shall be issued by the Borough Zoning
Official within 10 business days if the proposed signs conform in
every respect with the requirements of this article and, in the case
of a commercial use, with the applicable requirements for a master
signage plan. Before a sign permit is issued, applications will be
reviewed by the Sign Committee (a subcommittee of the Borough
Planning Board) and by the Borough's Historic Preservation
Commission, if the property is located within the Borough's
Historic District.
(2) If a requested sign or signage plan is rejected as noncompliant with
this article, the Borough Zoning Official shall, within 10 business
days of receipt of a complete application, specify the
noncompliance of the signs as compared with this article in a
written notice to the applicant. The applicant may appeal the
decision to the Zoning Board of Adjustment, or if the signage is part
of a development application, may request consideration of same
before the Borough's Board that has jurisdiction over the
development application.
E. Signage on development applications. Before acting on a development
application for a nonresidential use where installation or modification
of any sign is proposed, the Planning Board or Board of Adjustment, as
the case may be, shall, immediately after receipt of a complete
application, refer the master signage plan to the Borough Zoning
Official, who shall, within 10 business days, review the master signage
plan and submit his recommendations to the Board.

of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of the
existing grade prior to construction or the newly established grade
after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or
excavation solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in
which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign
height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of
the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of
the nearest point of the crown of a public road or the grade of the
land at the principal entrance to the principal structure of the lot,
whichever is lower.
(4) Location. The sign shall be at least five feet from any property line.

hereunder shall be taken down and removed by the permittee, owner, agent
or person having the beneficial use of the building or structure or land
upon which such sign may be found within 10 days after written notification
from the Zoning Officer. The failure to keep a nonconforming sign painted
or in good repair for a period of six months shall constitute abandonment,
home occupation and residing at the premises, provided that such
signs shall not exceed one square foot in area. This nameplate may be
attached to a building or to a post, which post shall not exceed five
feet in height. Such signs may be lighted if it is determined after a

§ 165-110. Title.
This article shall be known as and may be cited as the "Stormwater
Management Ordinance of the Borough of Chatham."
§ 165-111. Scope and purpose.
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural best management practices
(BMPs). Structural BMPs should be integrated with nonstructural
stormwater management measures and proper maintenance plans.
Nonstructural measures include both environmentally sensitive site
design and source controls that prevent pollutants from being placed on
the site. Source control plans should be developed based upon physical
site conditions and the origin, nature and the anticipated loading of
potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater management BMPs may be
necessary to achieve the established performance standards for water
quality, quantity and groundwater recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for "major
development" as defined in § 165-112, Definitions.
C. Applicability.
(1) This article shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for
the following major developments that require preliminary or final
site plan or subdivision review:
(a) Nonresidential major developments; and
(b) Aspects of residential major developments that are not preempted
by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21; and
(2) This article shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the Borough of Chatham.
(3) Except in any case where zoning and variances are specifically
referred to, this article is adopted pursuant to Article 6 of the
Municipal Land Use Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-37 et seq.
D. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued pursuant to this article are to be
considered an integral part of development approvals under the

§ 165-112. Definitions.
development permit, subdivision and site plan review process and do
not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits
or approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule,
act or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this article shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare. This article
is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other
ordinances, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law except
that, where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different
from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation or other
provision of law, the more restrictive provisions or higher standards
shall control.
A. For the purpose of this article, the following terms, phrases, words and
their derivations shall have the meaning given herein. When not
inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include
the future, words in the plural number include the singular and words
in the singular number include the plural number. The word "shall" is
always mandatory and not merely directory.

standards, structural stormwater management measures necessary to
meet these standards shall be incorporated into the design.
B. The standards in this section apply only to new major development and
are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on water
quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and maintain
groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new development
to the extent that alternative design and performance standards are
applicable under a regional stormwater management plan or water
quality management plan adopted in accordance with Department
rules.
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a
major development in accordance with § 165-120.
B. Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of
concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered species as
documented in the Department's Landscape Project or Natural
Heritage Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-15.147 through

disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion;
§ 165-112 GARAGE SALES § 165-114
154:417
(2) The construction of an aboveground utility line, provided that the
existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity and stormwater runoff quality requirements
of § 165-114F and G may be obtained for the enlargement of an existing
public roadway or railroad, or the construction or enlargement of a
public pedestrian access, provided that the following conditions are
met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates through an alternatives analysis, that
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of § 165-114F and G to the
maximum extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of § 165-114F and G, existing structures currently in use, such as
homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under § 165-114D(3) above within
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would
provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of
§ 165-114F and G that were not achievable on-site.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in § 165-114F
and G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth at § 165-114E into the design. The
applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures incorporated
into the design of the project. If the applicant contends that it is not
feasible for engineering, environmental or safety reasons to
incorporate any nonstructural stormwater management measures
identified in § 165-114E(2) below into the design of a particular
project, the applicant shall identify the strategy considered and
provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:

154:418
(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;
(d) Minimize the decrease in the time of concentration from

discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;
(i) Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
[1] Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that satisfy § 165-114E(3) below;

and debris from drainage systems;
[3] Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain
spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and
[4] When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24- 39 et seq., and implementing rules.
(3) Site design features identified under § 165-114E(2)(i)[1] above
shall comply with the following standard to control passage of solid
and floatable materials through storm drain inlets. For purposes of
this subsection, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment,
debris, trash and other floating, suspended or settleable solids. For
exemptions to this standard see § 165-114E(3)(c) below.
§ 165-114 GARAGE SALES § 165-114
154:419
(a) Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm
drain or surface water body under that grate:
[1] The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways
Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
[2] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square inches or
is no greater than five-tenths inch across the smallest
dimension.
Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates and grates of
spacer bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground

space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches or be no greater than
two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in § 165-114G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end of pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4.625 inches long and 1.5 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or

in § 165-114G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in § 165-114F and G
shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate county clerk's
office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices (BMP) Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from
the address identified in § 165-117 or found on the Department's
website at www.njstoramwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 165-115, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
§ 165-114 GARAGE SALES § 165-114
154:421
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated
[2] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading.
"High pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial
and commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department-approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan; and areas with high risks for
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels and lubricants, solvents and detergents that
are related to process, manufacturing or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[3] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
down gradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 165-115, complete one of
the following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
§ 165-114 CHATHAM CODE § 165-114
154:422
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area.
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development in § 165-112 shall be submitted to
the appropriate soil conservation district for review and approval in
accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable soil conservation district guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this
section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,
expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
§ 165-114 GARAGE SALES § 165-114
154:423
requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of
rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 165-117 or found on the Department's
website at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other
sources of technical guidance are listed in § 165-117. Total
suspended solids (TSS) reduction shall be calculated based on the
removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2 below. Alternative removal
rates and methods of calculating removal rates may be used if the
design engineer provides documentation demonstrating the
capability of these alternative rates and methods to the review
agency. A copy of any approved alternative rate or method of
calculating the removal rate shall be provided to the Department at
the following address: Division of Watershed Management, New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, P.O. Box 418
Trenton, New Jersey, 08625-0418.
§ 165-114 CHATHAM CODE § 165-114
154:424
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
80% TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize the
following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B  (A x B)/100
Where
R =total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs
A =the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B =the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second
BMP
Table 2: TSS Removal Rates for BMPs
Best Management Practice
TSS Percent Removal
Rate
Bioretention systems 90%
Constructed stormwater wetland 90%
Extended detention basin 40% to 60%
Infiltration structure 80%
Manufactured treatment device See § 165-116C
Sand filter 80%
Vegetative filter strip 60% to 80%
Wet pond 50% to 90%
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in § 165-114F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 165-117.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
§ 165-114 GARAGE SALES § 165-114
154:425
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession is provided.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under § 165-114G(8)(a)[1] above
shall only be allowed where previous development or
disturbance has occurred (for example, active agricultural
use, parking area or maintained lawn area). The
encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or center
line of the waterway where the bank is undefined. All
encroachments proposed under this subsection shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the Standards For
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
Standard For Off-Site Stability in the "Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
§ 165-114 CHATHAM CODE § 165-114
154:426
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq., then the stabilization measures in accordance
with the requirements of the above standards may be placed
within the special water resource protection area, provided
that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS
postconstruction removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to § 165-114G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to
§ 165-114G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional
value and overall condition of the special water resource
protection area as defined in § 165-114G(8)(a)[1] above. In no
case shall a stream corridor protection plan allow the
reduction of the special water resource protection area to less
than 150 feet as measured perpendicular to the waterway
subject to this subsection.

recharge.
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4  Hydrology and
Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds; or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at § 165-115A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at § 165-115A(1)(b). A runoff coefficient
or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition may
be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies
that the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion of
the site for at least five years without interruption prior to the time
of application. If more than one land cover have existed on the site
during the five years immediately prior to the time of application,
the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the
computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the site is
in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn
or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods) or with
good hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land
use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows or
culverts that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious

NRCS Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32 A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual; at

A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas; wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of § 165-118B(1).
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed and installed to be strong, durable and corrosion
resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions

(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2.5 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at

design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its
design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater
recharge and water quality design and performance standards
established by § 165-114 of this article.
C. Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements
of § 165-114 of this chapter, provided the pollutant removal rates are
verified by the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and
certified by the Department.

This section applies to any new stormwater management basin.
B. Requirements for trash racks, overflow grates and escape provisions
(1) A "trash rack" is a device designed to catch trash and debris and
prevent the clogging of outlet structures. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet from the stormwater
management basin to ensure proper functioning of the basin
outlets in accordance with the following:
(a) The trash rack shall have parallel bars, with no greater than six

B. General provision. No variance or other relief may be granted under the
terms of this section unless such variance or other relief can be granted
without substantial detriment to the public good and will not
substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and Zoning
Ordinance. Any application to the Zoning Board of Adjustment under

return to the owner unless a building permit is granted. The Board
shall impose reasonable requirements as a condition of granting
the building permit so as to promote the health, morals, safety and
general welfare of the public.
(2) Direct issuance of a building permit for the construction of a
building or structure on a lot not abutting a street which is shown
on a duly adopted Official Map of the municipality or which is an
existing state, county or municipal street or highway, or a street

street on a plan duly filed in the office of the County Recording
Officer. The Board may grant such relief only where the
enforcement of the statute requirement that a building lot abuts a
street would entail practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, or

D. In the case of applications involving more than one category of
application for development, such as an application for site plan or
subdivision approval coupled with a variance, the application charge
shall be the highest of the applicable charges, plus 50% of all other
applicable charges.
E. The application charge is a nonrefundable flat fee to cover
administrative expenses. On applications for site plan approval, the
applicant shall submit a statement in support of the calculation of the
application charge, which statement shall be subject to review by the
Board. The escrow account is established to cover the cost of
professional services, including engineering, legal and other expenses
connected with the review of submitted materials. Escrow account
funds not utilized in the review process will be returned to the
applicant.
(1) As invoices are received from time to time by the Board or by the
Borough from the professional consultants of the Board or the
Borough (attorney, planner, professional engineer, traffic engineer,
and others, who are employed to review the application for
development), the Chief Financial Officer of the municipality will
immediately request the applicant in writing to pay such additional
amount in the escrow account to equal the initial deposit plus all
outstanding directly related professional fee invoices. The Chief
Financial Officer will review the account at least monthly to insure
that the escrow fund is maintained at the prescribed level.
(2) As the invoices of the professional consultants are reviewed and
approved for payment by the Board and Council, the Chief
Financial Officer will pay 90% of the approved invoices from the
escrow account (the remaining 10% being paid by the municipality
from its general fund).
§ 165-166 CHATHAM CODE § 165-166
154:500
F. The Board hearing the application shall not proceed with any hearing
and shall not take any action (except to deny an application because of
nonpayment of fees) and shall not release any signed maps, site plans,
or plans, without first obtaining from the Chief Financial Officer a
certification that the applicant has paid all required charges and escrow
amounts. [Amended 3-11-2013 by Ord. No. 13-04]
G. Upon completion of the processing of an application for development
(whether by way of withdrawal, denial, approval, conditional approval
or other disposition), the Chief Financial Officer will, as soon as
practicable, either invoice the applicant for any remaining fees that
may be due (after deducting the 10% to be paid by the municipality) or
return any excess funds on hand to the applicant.
H. Upon request in writing, the Chief Financial Officer will provide the
applicant with a statement of the escrow account and with copies of all
professional consultants' fee invoices related to the application. The
applicant may request a hearing as to the reasonableness and/or
necessity of any of the costs incurred. If such request is received in
writing, the Council will hold a hearing with respect to the issues raised
by the applicant at the next available public meeting. The professional
consultants involved will be advised of the pending hearing. The failure
of the applicant to protest an invoice shall not be construed to be an
acknowledgment of the reasonableness of the invoice in the event the
issue should arise in any later proceeding.
I. Upon receipt of approval of the development plan, and as a condition
thereto, the applicant shall pay to the Borough as a deposit with respect
to professional inspection fees the sums required under the schedule
that appears below. In the case of a development plan involving
improvements that are intended to be accepted by the municipality, the

Engineer and the Mayor and Council. In the case of nonmunicipal
improvements (such as the improvements within a site-planned area),
the estimated construction costs shall be approved by the Borough
Engineer and the Board acting on the application.

In the event that the actual reasonable costs of inspection exceed
the deposit set forth herein, the Chief Financial Officer will invoice
the applicant for the difference. The applicant will not be deemed to
have satisfied the conditions of development plan approval unless said
invoice is paid in full. The Chief Financial Officer will promptly notify
the Construction Official of any deficiency with respect to the payment
of said fees. The Construction Official will not issue a certificate of
occupancy or any other permit until such invoice is paid in full.
J. Upon request in writing, the Chief Financial Officer will provide the
applicant with a statement of the escrow account and with copies of any
professional fee invoices relating to the inspection of the development.
The applicant may request a hearing as to the reasonableness of any of
the invoices. If such request is received in writing, the hearing will be
held by the Council at the next available public meeting. The failure of
the applicant to protest an invoice shall not be construed to be an
acknowledgment of the reasonableness of the invoice in the event the
issue should arise in any later proceeding.
A. Before recording final subdivision plats or recording of minor
subdivision deeds or as a condition of final site plan approval or as a
condition to the issuance of a zoning permit pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-65, the Borough Zoning Officer, Planning Board, or Zoning
Board of Adjustment may require and shall accept, in accordance with
the standards adopted herein, for the purpose of assuring the
installation and maintenance of certain on-tract improvements:
(1) The furnishing of a performance guarantee in favor of the Borough
in the amount equal to 120% of the cost of only those improvements
required by an approval or developer's agreement, ordinance, or
regulation to be dedicated to the Borough, and that have not yet
been installed, which cost shall be determined by the developer
and approved by the Borough Engineer, according to the method of
calculation set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4, for the following
improvements as shown on the approved plans or plat: streets,
pavement, gutters, curbs, sidewalks, street lighting, street trees,
surveyor's monuments, as shown on the final map and required by
the "Map Filing Law," P.L. 1960, c. 141,82 water mains, sanitary
sewers, community septic systems, drainage structures, public
improvements of open space, and any grading necessitated by the
proceeding improvements. The performance guarantee may also be
required to include, at the discretion of the Borough Zoning Officer,
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, a guarantee for the
installation of privately owned perimeter buffer landscaping. At the
82.Editor's Note: See now N.J.S.A. 46:26B-1 et seq.
§ 165-166 CHATHAM CODE § 165-167
154:502
developer's option, a separate performance guarantee may be
posted for the privately owned perimeter buffer landscaping. The
developer shall prepare an itemized cost estimate of the
improvements covered by the performance guarantee for review
and approval by the Borough Engineer, which improvements shall
be appended to each performance guarantee posted by the obligor.
(2) The developer shall post with the Borough, prior to the release of
the performance guarantee, a maintenance guarantee in an
amount equal to 15% of the cost of the installation of the
improvements covered under the performance guarantee, along
with the following private site improvements: stormwater
management basins, inflow and water quality structures within the
basins, and the outflow pipes and structures of the stormwater
maintenance system, if any, which itemized cost shall be
determined by the developer and approved by the Borough
Engineer according to the method of calculation set forth in N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53.4. The term of the maintenance guarantee shall be for a
period not to exceed two years and shall automatically expire at the
end of the established term.
(3) The furnishing of a "safety and stabilization guarantee" in favor of
the Borough to ensure that the Borough has an adequate guarantee
to return the property that has been disturbed to a safe and stable
condition or otherwise implement measures to protect the public
from access to an unsafe or unstable condition. The Borough shall
be permitted to access the guarantee when site disturbance has
commenced and, thereafter, all work on the development has
ceased for a period of at least 60 consecutive days following such
commencement for reasons other than force majeure; and work has
not recommenced within 30 days following the provision of written
notice by the municipality to the developer of the municipality's
intent to claim payment under the guarantee. At the developer's
option, the safety and stabilization guarantee may be included as a
line item for safety and stabilization in the performance guarantee
rather than in the form of a separate guarantee. The amount of the
safety and stabilization guarantee shall be calculated pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4 as follows:
(a) Five thousand dollars for the first $100,000 of bonded
improvement costs; plus
(b) Two and a half percent of bonded improvement costs in excess
of $100,000 up to $1,000,000; plus
(c) One percent of bonded improvement costs in excess of
$1,000,000.
B. The time allowed for installation of the bonded improvements for which
the performance guarantee has been provided may be extended by the
governing body by resolution. As a condition or part of any such
§ 165-167 GARAGE SALES § 165-167
154:503
extension, the amount of any performance guarantee shall be increased
or reduced, as the case may be, to an amount not to exceed 120% of the
cost of the installation as determined by the developer and approved by
the Borough Engineer according to the method of calculation set forth
in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4 as of the time of the passage of the resolution.
C. If the required bonded improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guarantee, the obligor and surety, if
any, shall be liable thereon to the Borough for the reasonable cost of the
improvements not completed or corrected, and the Borough may, either
prior to or after receipt of the proceeds thereof, complete such
improvements.
D. Upon substantial completion of all required street improvements
(except for the top course) and appurtenant utility improvements and
the connection of same to the public system, the obligor may notify the
governing body in writing by certified mail addressed in care of the
Borough Clerk of the completion or substantial completion of bonded
improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Borough Engineer.
The request shall indicate which bonded improvements have been
completed and which bonded improvements remain uncompleted in the
judgment of the obligor. Thereupon the Borough Engineer shall inspect
all bonded improvements of which such notice has been given and shall
file a detailed report, in writing, with the governing body, indicating
either approval, partial approval or rejection of such improvements
with a statement of reasons for any rejection. The cost of the
improvements as approved or rejected shall be set forth.
E. Determination of governing body.
(1) The governing body, by resolution, shall either approve the bonded
improvements determined to be complete and satisfactory by the
Borough Engineer, or reject any or all of these bonded
improvements upon the establishment in the resolution of cause for
rejection, and shall approve and authorize the amount of reduction
to be made in the performance guarantee relating to the
improvements accepted, in accordance with the itemized cost
estimate prepared by the Borough Engineer and appended to the
performance guarantee. This resolution shall be adopted no later
than 45 days after receipt of the list and report prepared by the
Borough Engineer. Upon adoption of the resolution by the
governing body, the obligor shall be released from all liability
pursuant to its performance guarantee with respect to those
approved bonded improvements, except for that portion adequately
sufficient to secure completion or correction of the improvements
not yet approved; provided that 30% of the amount of the total
performance guarantee and safety and stabilization guarantee
posted may be retained to ensure completion and acceptability of
all improvements. The safety and stabilization guarantee shall be
reduced by the same percentage as the performance guarantee is
§ 165-167 CHATHAM CODE § 165-167
154:504
being reduced at the time of each performance guarantee
reduction.
(2) For the purpose of releasing the obligor from liability pursuant to
its performance guarantee, the amount of the performance
guarantee attributable to each approved bonded improvement
shall be reduced by the total amount for each such improvement, in
accordance with the itemized cost estimate which formed the basis
of the performance guarantee and appended to the performance
guarantee pursuant to Subsection A of this section, including any
contingency factor applied to the cost of installation. If the sum of
the approved bonded improvements would exceed 70% of the total
amount of the performance guarantee, then the municipality may
retain 30% of the amount of the total performance guarantee and
safety and stabilization guarantee to ensure completion and
acceptability of bonded improvements, as provided above, except
that any amount of the performance guarantee attributable to
bonded improvements for which a "temporary certificate of
occupancy guarantee" has been posted shall be released from the
performance guarantee even if such release would reduce the
amount held by the municipality below 30%.
F. If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the approving
authority may require the obligor to complete such improvements, and,
upon completion, the same procedure of notification as set forth in this
section shall be followed.
G. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the
obligor to contest by legal proceedings any determination of the
governing body or the Borough Engineer.
H. Inspection fees.
(1) The obligor shall reimburse the municipality for reasonable
inspection fees paid to the Borough Engineer for the foregoing
inspection of the improvements which shall not exceed the sum of
the amount set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53. The municipality may
require the developer to post the inspection fees in escrow in an
amount calculated as follows:
(a) Except for extraordinary circumstances, the greater of $500 or
5% of the cost of improvements subject to a performance
guarantee; plus
(b) An amount not to exceed 5% of the cost of private site
improvements not subject to a performance guarantee, which
cost shall be determined pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4.
(2) If the Borough determines that the amount in escrow for the
payment of inspection fees, as calculated herein, is insufficient to
cover the cost of additional required inspections, the Borough may
require the developer to deposit additional funds in escrow,
§ 165-167 GARAGE SALES § 165-167
154:505
provided that the Borough delivers to the developer a written
inspection escrow deposit request which informs the developer
of the need for additional inspections, details the items or
undertakings that require inspection, estimates the time required
for those inspections, and estimates the cost of performing those
inspections.
I. In the event that final approval is by stages or sections of the
development pursuant to Subsection a of Section 29 of the Municipal
Land Use Law (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-38), the provisions of this section shall
be applied by stage or section.
J. Temporary certificate of occupancy.
(1) In the event that the developer shall seek a temporary certificate of
occupancy for a development, unit, lot, building, or phase of
development, as a condition of the issuance thereof, the developer
shall furnish a separate guarantee, referred to herein as a
"temporary certificate of occupancy guarantee," in favor of the
Borough in an amount equal to 120% of the cost of installation of
only those improvements or items which remain to be completed or
installed under the terms of the temporary certificate of occupancy
and which are required to be installed or completed as a condition
precedent to the issuance of the permanent certificate of
occupancy for the development, unit, lot, building or phase of
development and which are not covered by an existing
performance guarantee. Upon posting of a temporary certificate of
occupancy guarantee, all sums remaining under a performance
guarantee, required pursuant to § 165-167 of the Chatham Code,
which relate to the development, unit, lot building, or phase of
development for which the temporary certificate of occupancy is
sought shall be released.
(2) The scope and amount of the temporary certificate of occupancy
guarantee shall be determined by the Borough Zoning Officer,
Borough Engineer, or any other Borough official designated by
ordinance. The temporary certificate of occupancy guarantee shall
be released by the Borough Zoning Officer, Borough Engineer, or
any other Borough official designated by ordinance upon the
issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy with regard to the
development, unit, lot, building, or phase as to which the
temporary certificate of occupancy relates.
K. If the property or any part of same is sold, or otherwise conveyed to a
successor developer prior to the completion and acceptance of all
improvements, an assignment of developer's agreement and new
performance, maintenance or other guarantees shall be required from
the new owner or successor developer. Upon the transfer of ownership
of property that is the subject of a construction permit, and prior to
beginning or continuing work authorized by the construction permit,
the new owner or successor developer shall file with the building
§ 165-167 CHATHAM CODE § 165-167
154:506
§ 165-168. Off-tract improvements.
department an application for a permit update to notify the building
department of the name and address of the new owner or successor
developer and of all other changes to the information previously
submitted to the building department. The building department shall
not approve the application for a permit update until it receives
notification from the governing body or its designee that the new
owner or successor developer has furnished adequate replacement
performance, maintenance or other guarantees and assignment of
developer's agreement.
A. Improvements to be constructed at the sole expense of the subdivider
or developer. In cases where the need for an off-tract improvement is
created by the proposed subdivision or site plan and where no other
property owners receive a special benefit thereby, the Planning Board
may recommend to the governing body that it require the subdivider or
developer, as a condition for subdivision or site plan approval at the
subdivider's or developer's expense, to acquire lands outside of the
subdivision or tract and improve and dedicate such lands to the
Borough or the County, or, in lieu thereof, require the subdivider or
developer to deposit with the Borough a sum of money sufficient to
allow the municipality to acquire and to improve such lands.
B. Other improvements.
(1) In cases where the need for any off-tract improvement is created by
the proposed subdivision or site plan and where the Planning Board
determines that properties outside the subdivision or tract will also
be benefited by the improvement, the Planning Board shall
forthwith forward to the municipal governing body a list and
description of all such improvements together with its request that
the governing body determine and advise the Board of the
procedure to be followed in the construction or installation thereof.
The Planning Board shall defer final action upon the subdivision or
site plan until receipt of the governing body's determination or
until the expiration of 90 days after the forwarding of such list and
description to the governing body without such determination
having been made, whichever occurs sooner.
(2) The governing body, within 90 days after receipt of said list and
description, shall determine and advise the Planning Board
whether:
(a) The improvement or improvements are to be constructed or
installed by the municipality.
[1] As a general improvement, the cost of which is to be borne
at general expense (except as hereinafter otherwise
provided as to a contribution thereto by the subdivider or
developer)
§ 165-167 GARAGE SALES § 165-168
154:507
[2] As a local improvement, all or part of the cost of which is to
be specially assessed against properties benefited thereby
in proportion to benefits conferred by the improvements in
accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:56-1 et seq. (except as
hereinafter otherwise provided as to a contribution thereto
by the subdivider or developer).
(b) The improvement or improvements are to be constructed or
installed by the subdivider or developer under a formula for
partial reimbursement as hereinafter set forth.
(3) If the governing body shall determine that the improvement or
improvements shall be constructed or installed under Subsection
B(2)(a)[1] above, the Planning Board shall estimate with the aid of
the Borough Engineer or such other persons as have pertinent
information or expertise the amount, if any, by which the total cost
thereof will exceed the total amount by which all properties,
including the subdivision or tract, will be specially benefited
thereby, and the subdivider or developer shall be liable to the
municipality for such excess. Further, the governing body shall
adopt an ordinance authorizing and providing for the financing of
the improvement or improvements in a manner consistent with the
obligation of the subdivider or developer for any excess of total cost
over total benefits conferred, as set forth above.
(4) If the governing body shall determine that the improvement or
improvements shall be constructed or installed under Subsection
B(2)(a)[2] above, the Planning Board shall, as provided in
Subsection B(3) of this subsection, estimate the difference between
the total costs to be incurred and the total amount by which all
properties, including the subdivision property or tract, will be
specially benefited by the improvement, and the subdivider or
developer shall be liable to the municipality therefor, as well as for
the amount of any special assessments against the subdivision
property or tract for benefits conferred by the improvement or
improvements. Further, the governing body shall adopt an
ordinance authorizing and providing for the financing of the
improvement or improvements and the assessment of benefits
arising therefor in a manner consistent with the obligation of the
subdivider or developer with respect thereto and proceedings
under said ordinance shall be in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:56-1 et
seq., except to the extent modified by the obligation of the
subdivider or developer for any excess of total costs over total
benefits conferred, as set forth above.
(5) If the governing body shall determine that the improvement or
improvements are to be constructed or installed by the subdivider
or developer under Subsection B(2)(b) above, the Planning Board
shall in like manner estimate the amount of such excess, and the
subdivider or developer shall be liable to the municipality therefor
as well as for the amount of any special assessments against the
§ 165-168 CHATHAM CODE § 165-168
154:508
subdivision property or tract for benefits conferred by the
improvement or improvements. However, the subdivider or
developer shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the municipality
for the amount of any special assessments against property other
than the subdivision property or tract for benefits conferred by
the improvement or improvements, and proceedings under said
ordinance shall be in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:56-1 et seq.
However, any such assessment against the subdivision property or
tract shall be marked paid and satisfied in consideration of the
construction or installation of the improvement or improvements
by the subdivider or developer.
(6) If the governing body shall not adopt such an ordinance or
resolution within said time, the final subdivision layout or site plan
shall be designed accordingly, and the Planning Board shall
thereupon grant or deny final approval.
C. Performance guarantee. The subdivider or developer shall be required
to provide, as a condition for final approval of his subdivision or site
plan application, a performance guarantee running to the municipality
as follows:
(1) If the improvement is to be constructed by the subdivider or
developer under subsection A or under Subsection B(2)(b) of this
section, a performance bond with surety in an amount equal to the
estimated cost of the improvement, or as to any part of said
improvement that is to be acquired or installed by the municipality
under said Subsection A, a cash deposit equal to the estimated cost
of such acquisition or installation by the municipality;
(2) If the improvement is to be constructed by the municipality as a
general improvement under Subsection B(2)(a)[1] of this section, a
cash deposit equal to the amount of the excess of the estimated
cost of the improvement over the estimated total amount by which
all properties, including the subdivision property or tract, will be
specially benefited thereby; and
(3) If the improvement is to be constructed by the municipality as a
local improvement under Subsection B(2)(a)[2] of this section, a
cash deposit equal to the amount by which the subdivision property
or tract will be specially benefited by the improvement.
D. Refund of deposit where improvements are not authorized within five
years. In any case in which a subdivider or developer shall deposit
money with the municipality for the completion of an improvement that
is to be constructed pursuant to this chapter by the municipality, the
subdivider or developer shall be entitled to a full refund of such deposit
if the governing body of the municipality shall not have enacted an
ordinance authorizing the improvement within five years after the date
all other improvements are completed.
§ 165-168 GARAGE SALES § 165-168
154:509
E. Deposit of funds. All moneys paid by a subdivider or developer pursuant
to this Ordinance shall be deposited with the Borough of Chatham and a
suitable depository shall be established for said monies. Such funds
shall be used only for the improvements for which they are deposited or
improvements serving the same purpose.
F. Redetermination of assessment upon completion of improvement. Upon
completion of off-tract improvements required pursuant to this section,
the subdivider's or developer's liability hereunder shall be recalculated
in accordance with the actual, as compared with the estimated, cost of
the improvements. To the extent that it shall decrease the amount
thereof, the municipality shall forthwith refund the amount of such
decrease to the subdivider or developer. In cases where improvements
are specially assessed against all benefited properties, recalculations
shall be made by the municipal assessing authority in the course of the
special assessment proceedings. In other cases, it shall be made by the
Borough Engineer.
G. Governing body approval required. All estimates required to be made
by the Planning Board herein shall be reviewed and approved by the
governing body to final action thereon.

who receives a letter of nonrecommendation from the VRO. Individuals
who receive a letter of nonrecommendation from the VRO will not be
permitted to participate as a coach. Such individuals may obtain a copy

individuals shall then have 30 days from the receipt of notification from

consider the following factors in conjunction with the provisions of

supervision.
D. In all instances, the final determination of whether an individual will be
permitted to serve as a coach will lie in the sole discretion of the
Chatham Review Committee, whose vote must be unanimous.

or current coach whether he or she is qualified to serve as a coach.

the VRO, the Administrators shall file that letter with the Police
Departments of Chatham Township and Chatham Borough.
G. The Police Departments shall keep the written notification on file for
three years from the date it was issued.

proceeding under the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L. 1999,
c. 274 (N.J.S.A. 2A:58-10 et seq.). Penalty monies collected shall be
paid to the Chief Financial Officer of the Borough.
(2) Deemed ineligible to place, use or employ a donation clothing bin
for solicitation purposes. A person who is deemed ineligible may

§ 204-1. General provisions.
(a) Acted within the public interest; and
(b) Demonstrated that he has made a good faith effort to comply
with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.60 et seq. and this
ordinance and had no fraudulent intentions.
A. Title. This chapter shall be known as the "Property Maintenance Code
of the Borough of Chatham."
B. Legislative findings. It is hereby found and declared that there exist in
the Borough of Chatham structures used for residential, nonresidential
or mixed-use occupancy which are, or may become in the future,
substandard with respect to structure, equipment or maintenance or,
further, that such conditions, including but not limited to structural
deterioration, lack of maintenance and appearance of exterior of
premises, infestation, lack of essential heating, plumbing, storage or
refrigeration equipment, lack of maintenance or upkeep of essential
utilities and facilities, existence of fire hazards, inadequate provisions
for light and air or unsanitary conditions and overcrowding constitute a
menace to the health, safety, welfare and reasonable comfort of the
citizens and inhabitants of the Borough of Chatham. It is further found
and declared that by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive
deterioration, certain properties have the further effect of creating
blighting conditions, and that if the same are not curtailed and
removed, the aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and will
necessitate, in time, the expenditure of large amounts of public funds to
correct and eliminate the same, and that by reason of timely regulations
and restrictions as herein contained, blight may be prevented and the
neighborhood and property values in the Borough thereby maintained,
the desirability and amenities of residential and nonresidential uses and
neighborhoods enhanced and the public health, safety and welfare
protected and fostered.
C. Purposes. The purposes of this code are to protect the public health,
safety and welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the
maintenance, appearance, condition and occupancy of residential,
§ 199-15 CHATHAM CODE § 204-1
188:576
nonresidential premises and mixed-occupancy buildings, to establish
minimum standards governing utilities, facilities and other physical
components and conditions essential to make the aforesaid facilities fit
for human habitation, occupancy and use, to fix certain responsibilities
and duties upon owners, occupants and operators, to authorize and
establish procedures for the inspection of residential, nonresidential
and mixed-occupancy structures or premises, to establish procedures
for implementing the requirements of this code, to fix penalties for
the violations of this code and to provide for the repair or vacation of
premises found to be in violation of this code.
D. Applicability. Every residential, nonresidential or mixed-use occupancy
building and the premises on which it is situated, used or intended to be
used for dwelling, commercial, business or industrial occupancy shall
comply with the provisions of this code, whether or not such structure
shall have been constructed, altered or repaired before or after the
enactment of this code and irrespective of any permits or licenses
which shall have been issued for the use or occupancy of the building or
premises, for the construction or repair of the building or for the
installation or repair of equipment or facilities prior to the effective
date of this code.
E. Conflict with other provisions. In any case where the provisions of this
code impose a higher standard than set forth in any other chapter, other
local ordinance or under the laws of the State of New Jersey, then the
standards as set forth herein shall prevail, but if the provisions of this
code impose a lower standard than any other chapter, other local
ordinance or of the laws of the State of New Jersey, then the higher
standard contained in any such other chapter, ordinance or law shall
prevail. In addition, nothing contained herein shall in any way abrogate
the authority of the Health Officer and/or Board of Health to enforce the
provisions of the Board of Health Code.
F. Responsibilities. Unless expressly provided to the contrary in this code,
the respective obligations and responsibilities of the property owner,
operator and occupant shall not be altered or affected by any
agreement or contract by and between any of the aforesaid or between
them and other parties. The primary responsibility for compliance with
the provisions of this code shall be that of the property owner.
G. Effect on other provisions. No license or permit or other certification of
compliance with this code shall constitute a defense against any
violation of any other local ordinance applicable to any structure or
premises or use of such structure or premises, nor shall any provision
herein relieve any owner, operator, or occupant from complying with
any such other provision or any official of the Borough from enforcing
any such other provision.

§ 204-3. Enforcement.
of the interior and the display of items representative of any goods or
services pertaining to the business therein.
A. Property Maintenance Officer. The provisions of this code shall be
enforced by the Zoning Officer or his/her designated representative,
who shall be referred to herein as the "Property Maintenance Officer."
B. Enforcement procedure.
(1) Where a violation of this code is found to exist, a written notice
from the Property Maintenance Officer shall be served upon the
owner, operator or occupant who shall be responsible for
correcting such condition. The notice shall contain the following:
(a) An identification of the conditions constituting the violation(s)
and why the notice is being issued;
(b) The necessary corrective actions;
(c) A reasonable time period, not to exceed 60 days, to correct or
abate the violation;
(d) The right of the person in violation to request a hearing;
(e) A statement that the notice shall become a final order of the
Property Maintenance Officer in 10 days after service, unless a
hearing is requested, in writing, within that time period; and
(f) A statement that, if the owner, operator or occupant fails to
comply with the notice, the Property Maintenance Officer may
cause the removal and/or abatement of such violation(s) and
assess the cost of said removal or abatement against the
premises.
(2) The notice shall be served personally or by certified mail at the last
known address of the owner, operator or occupant alleged to be in
violation. Where it is ascertained that the owner, operator, or
occupant does not reside on the premises and the last known
address cannot be ascertained, the notice may be posted in a
conspicuous place on the outside front entrance of the affected
structure.
(3) Service upon any owner, operator, or occupant may also be
achieved by service of any notice upon a member of the family of
the owner, operator, or occupant of the age of 14 years or over then
residing at the residence of such owner, operator or occupant.
(4) After 10 days from the date of service of the notice, the notice shall
constitute a final order, unless any owner, operator, or occupant
alleged to be in violation request a hearing thereon before the
Borough Administrator or his/her designated representative by
§ 204-2 CHATHAM CODE § 204-3
188:580
serving a written request, in person or by certified mail, upon
the Property Maintenance Officer for such hearing. The request
for hearing shall state briefly the ground or reasons on which the
request for hearing is based and the factual matters contained in
the notice of violation that are disputed by the person alleged to
be in violation. Appeals will be granted strictly on factual matters.
Upon receipt of the request for hearing, the matter shall be set for
hearing within 30 days therefrom and with five days' notice to the
party alleged to be in violation.
(5) At the hearing provided for herein, the Borough Administrator or
his/her designated representative shall act as Hearing Officer and
consider the matter presented by the owner, operator, or occupant
alleged to be in violation, together with all other relevant evidence.
Within 10 days from the date of the hearing, the Borough
Administrator or his/her designated representative shall affirm,
modify or vacate the prior notice issued by the Property
Maintenance Officer in any manner deemed appropriate by him or
her and consistent with the provisions and enforcement of this
code.
(6) The Property Maintenance Officer may extend the time for
correction and abatement of any violation of this code for an
additional period of time not to exceed 30 days, except where major
capital improvement or renovations are involved, in which case the
time for completion may be extended for such a period of time as
the Property Maintenance Officer may deem reasonable and
adequate.
C. Inspections; violations and penalties.
(1) When the Property Maintenance Officer believes or has reason to
believe that violations of the provisions of this code exist, he shall
make or cause to be made inspections to determine the condition of
such structures and premises in order to safeguard the safety and
welfare of persons and property and fulfill the provisions of this
code.
(2) The Property Maintenance Officer is authorized to enter occupied
structures or premises at reasonable times with reasonable prior
notice to inspect subject to permission by the owner, operator or
occupant in control of the premises and constitutional restrictions
on unreasonable searches and seizures. If the Property
Maintenance Officer is denied entry to any structure or premises
after a request is made, the Property Maintenance Officer may
obtain an administrative search warrant or other authorization
from a court of competent jurisdiction to enter the structure or
premises and conduct the necessary and authorized search. Such
search warrant shall be requested from a court of competent
jurisdiction upon the submission of any photographs obtained from
public property or neighboring property and an affidavit stating the
§ 204-3 NUMBERING OF BUILDINGS § 204-3
188:581
reasons a violation exists of this code along with any other
supporting evidence justifying the issuance of the search warrant.
(3) Abandoned structures and premises shall be subject to
unrestricted, complete and thorough Code inspections, including
legal right of entry into those structures found unsecured. All
abandoned structures and premises shall be subject to vigorous
Code enforcement and it shall be the duty of the Property
Maintenance Officer to give abandoned structures and lots priority
enforcement to ensure public safety and welfare.
(4) An owner, operator, or occupant who violates this code by failure to
comply with an order entered by the Property Maintenance Officer
shall appear before the Municipal Judge for a hearing and/or
imposition of fines, sanctions, sentence, or any combination
thereof. In addition, the Property Maintenance Officer may cause
the removal and/or abatement of the violation(s), and the cost of
said removal or abatement shall be assessed against the property
as provided herein.
(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Property Maintenance Officer
may also maintain an action or proceeding in a court of competent
jurisdiction to recover the costs of the removal and/or abatement
and/or compel compliance with or restrain by injunction the
violation of the Code.
(6) Each violation of a different section of this code shall constitute a
separate and distinct violation independent of any other section.
Each day's failure to comply with any provision of this code shall
constitute a separate violation.
D. Withholding of strict enforcement. The Property Maintenance Officer
shall have the power to withhold strict enforcement of this code upon
written application therefor by an owner, operator, or occupant after
making a determination that:
(1) Any variation or modification of a structure or use approved by the
Property Maintenance Officer is consistent with the intent and
purpose of this code and will not detrimentally affect the health or
safety of the owners, operators or occupants of the premises or the
health, safety or welfare of same or the owners, operators or
occupants of adjacent premises or of the Borough;
(2) Strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary
hardship on the owner, operator or occupant because it would
compel expenditures for the premises which would be substantially
disproportionate to any benefit to the health, safety or welfare that
might be derived therefrom; and
(3) The owner, operator or occupant is without any practical or feasible
means to comply with the strict provisions of this code.

that, by reason of location above ground level, constitute a danger
of falling on persons in the vicinity thereof;

uncleared snow, excretions of pets and other animals on paths,
walks, driveways, parking lots and parking areas and other parts of

plastic or of similar materials, said materials, where exposed to public
view, shall be maintained in good condition and shall not show evidence
of excessive weathering, discoloration, ripping, tearing or other
deterioration. Nothing herein shall be construed to authorize any

A. The Borough Administrator, or his/her designee, is hereby designated
and appointed as the Public Officer of the Borough of Chatham for
purposes of this section. The Public Officer shall exercise the powers
and duties prescribed by this chapter pursuant to the provisions of
N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.3 et seq.
B. It is hereby found and declared that the existence or occupation of any
building(s), or parts thereof, lying within the corporate limits of the
Borough, which are so old, dilapidated, or have become so out of repair
as to be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human
habitation or occupancy or use are inimical to the welfare and
dangerous and injurious to the health and safety of the people of this
Borough, and a public necessity exists for the repair, closing or
demolition of such building(s), or parts thereof.
C. Whenever a petition is filed with the Public Officer by a public authority
or by at least five residents of the municipality, charging that any
building is unfit for human habitation or occupancy or use, or whenever
it appears to the Public Officer that any building is unfit for human
habitation or occupancy or use, the Public Officer shall, if his
preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and
cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest in such
building a complaint stating the charges in that respect and containing
a notice that a hearing will be held before the Public Officer or his
designated agent, at a place therein fixed, not less than seven days nor
more than 30 days after the service of said complaint; and that the
owner and parties in interest shall be given the right to file an answer to
the complaint and to appear in person or otherwise give testimony at
the place and time fixed in the complaint; and that the strict rules of
evidence prevailing in the courts of New Jersey shall not be controlling
at the hearing.
D. The Public Officer may determine that a building is unfit for human
habitation, occupancy or use if he finds that conditions exist in such
building which are dangerous or injurious to the health or safety of the
occupants of such building, the occupants of neighboring buildings or
other residents of the Borough of Chatham, including but not limited to
defects therein increasing the hazards of fire, accident or other
calamities, lack of adequate ventilation, light or sanitary facilities,
dilapidation, disrepair, structural defects, uncleanliness and failure to
comply with the requirements of this code or the certificate of
occupancy.
E. If, after notice and hearing as set forth herein, the Public Officer
determines that the building under consideration is unfit for human
habitation or occupancy or use, he/she shall state in writing his findings
of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be
served upon the owner thereof and parties in interest an order
requiring the repair, alteration or improvement of said building to be
made by the owner within a reasonable period of time as established by
the Public Officer, but not to exceed 30 days, or permitting the owner, at
§ 204-10 CHATHAM CODE § 204-10
188:590
his option, to vacate or have said building vacated and closed within the
time set forth in the order.
F. If, however, the building is in such a condition as to make it dangerous
to the health and safety of persons on or near the premises and the
owner fails to repair, alter or improve said building within the time
specified in the order, then the owner shall be required to remove or
demolish said building within a reasonable period of time as established
by the Public Officer, but not to exceed 30 days, as specified in the order
of removal.
G. If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter or improve or,
at the option of the owner, to vacate and close the building, the Public
Officer may cause such building to be repaired, altered or improved or
to be vacated and closed.
H. If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the
building, the Public Officer may cause such building to be removed or
demolished or may contract for the removal or demolition thereof after
advertisement for and receipt of bids therefor.
I. The cost of the filing of legal papers, expert witnesses' fees, search fees
and advertising charges incurred in the course of any proceeding taken
under this act determined in favor of the municipality and such cost of
such repairs, alterations, improvements or the removal or demolition of
the building or any part(s) thereof, if any, or the amount of the balance
thereof remaining after deduction of the sum, if any, realized from the
sale of materials derived from such building or from any contract for
removal or demolition thereof shall be a municipal lien against the real
property upon which such cost was incurred. If the building is removed
or demolished by order of the Public Officer, he shall sell the materials
of such building. There shall be credited against the cost of the removal
or demolition thereof the proceeds of any sale of such materials or any
sum derived from any contract for the removal or demolition of the
building. If there are no such credits or if the sum total of such costs
exceeds the total of such credits, a detailed statement of the aforesaid
costs and the amount so due shall be filed with the Tax Assessor or
other custodian of the records of tax liens, and a copy thereof shall be
forthwith forwarded to the owner by registered mail. If the total of the
credits exceed such costs, the balance remaining shall be deposited in
the Superior Court by the Public Officer and shall be secured in such
manner as may be directed by such court and shall be disbursed
according to the order or judgment of the court to the persons found to
be entitled thereto by final order or judgment of such court.
J. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way
the Borough's authority to define and declare nuisances and to cause
their removal or abatement, by summary proceedings or otherwise.
K. Any owner or party in interest may, within 60 days from the date of the
filing of the lien certificate set forth in Subsection A above, proceed in a

summons and complaint in an action to foreclose on a mortgage against
the subject property, but prior to vesting of title in the creditor or any
other third party, and the exterior of the property is found to be a
nuisance or in violation of any applicable state law or Borough
ordinance, the Property Maintenance Officer, or his/her designee, shall
notify the creditor or the representative or agent of any creditor located
outside the State of New Jersey, as applicable, which shall have the
responsibility to abate or correct the violation in the same manner and
to the same extent as the title owner of the property, to the standard
and specification required by state law or Borough ordinance. The
notice shall include a description of the condition which gave rise to the
violation with the notice of violation, and shall provide a period of 30
days of the creditor's receipt of the notice for the creditor to remedy the
violation. If the creditor fails to remedy the violation within that time
period, the Borough may impose penalties allowed for the violation of
its ordinances pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:49-5.

D. Local limits. (Reserved)
§ 217-25 CHATHAM CODE § 217-25
188:628
E. Compliance determination.
(1) Compliance determinations with respect to any conformance with
ordinances or permit conditions or limitations may be made on the
basis of instantaneous grab samples, sequential grab samples, or
composite samples. Sequential grab samples or composite samples
may be taken over a twenty-four-hour period, or any other time
span, as deemed necessary by the NJDEP, to meet the requirements
of a specific situation.
(2) Whenever it shall be necessary for the purpose of these general
sewer use requirements, authorized representatives of the MCJM,
NJDEP, USEPA, or other governmental authorities having
jurisdiction may, upon presentation of credentials, enter upon the
premises of any user as follows:
(a) During business hours, on notice to authorized personnel of
the user, but without the necessity of a warrant, for the
purposes of inspecting, copying, or photographing any records
required to be kept.
(b) At any time without a warrant or prior notice for the purpose of
installing or inspecting any monitoring equipment or method,
inspecting the process wastewater pretreatment facility, and/
or measuring, sampling and/or testing any discharge of
wastewater either from process wastewater pretreatment
facilities or the point of discharge to the MCJM wastewater
facilities or wastewater treatment works. The user shall
instruct security personnel to provide immediate access to
such representatives upon presentation of valid credentials at
any hour and under any and all circumstances. The user's
security personnel will be entitled to accompany the entering
representatives.
(c) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be
promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request
of the MCJM and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing
such access shall be borne by the user.
(d) Immediate access shall be granted to authorized
representatives of the MCJM, NJDEP, USEPA, or other
governmental authorities having jurisdiction upon
presentation of valid credentials. Unreasonable delays in
allowing access to the uer's premises shall be a violation of this
article.
(3) Each user shall reimburse the MCJM for the actual costs incurred
by the MCJM for such monitoring, sampling, investigation,
engineering evaluation, administrative costs, legal services, or
other services which are necessary or appropriate, in addition to
those services which are minimally required and which are
§ 217-25 NUMBERING OF BUILDINGS § 217-25
188:629
properly allocable to the user's operation. Payment for such
expenses shall be made by the user within 10 days after the
submission of an invoice by the MCJM.
F. Emergency suspensions.
(1) Upon advance notice to the Borough Administrator and the Health
Officer, the Superintendent of the MCJM may immediately suspend
a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.
Upon advance notice to the Borough Administrator and the Health
Officer, the Superintendent of the MCJM may also immediately
suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the
POTW, which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the
environment, or for noncompliance with pretreatment standards
and requirements.
(2) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, and
upon advance notice to the Borough Administrator and the Health
Officer, the Superintendent may take such steps as deemed
necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection,
to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream,
or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent of the
MCJM and/or the NJDEP may allow the user to recommence its
discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the Superintendent and/or the NJDEP that the period of
endangerment has passed.
G. Affirmative defenses to general prohibitions. A user shall have an
affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general prohibitions in § 217-25 if it can prove
that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or
in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause passthrough
or cause interference and that either:
(1) A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the
pass-through or interference; or
(2) No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the
MCJM was regularly in compliance with its NJPDES permit, and, in
the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge
use or disposal requirements.
H. Notification of changed conditions. Each user must notify the
Superintendent of the MCJM, and obtain prior written approval, at least
§ 217-25 CHATHAM CODE § 217-25
188:630
10 days in advance of any planned significant changes to the user's
operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume
of its wastewater, or result in the user meeting the definition of
"significant indirect user" established at N.J.A.C. 7:14A-1.2, or of any
substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their
discharge. The MCJM reserves the right to deny or condition new
or increased contributions of pollutants, or changes in the nature of
pollutants, where such contributions do not meet applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements or where such contributions
would cause the MCJM to violate its NJPDES permit.
(1) The Superintendent of the MCJM may require the user to submit
such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the
changed condition.
(2) For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but
are not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, and the
discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
I. Notification of slug discharges.
(1) An industrial user shall immediately notify the MCJM of any
incident of accidental or slug discharge. The notification shall
include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration
and volume.
(2) An industrial user shall take immediate action to contain and
minimize the accidental or slug discharge so as to prevent
interference with the treatment process, damage to the treatment
system, and pass-through to the receiving stream or contamination
of the sludge.
(3) Within five days following accidental and/or slug discharge, the
industrial user shall submit to the NJDEP and MCJM a detailed
written report describing the date, time, and cause of the
discharge, the quantity and characteristics of the discharge and
corrective action taken at the time of the discharge, and the
measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future
occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a
result of damage to treatment system, fish kills, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve
the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be
imposed by any permit or other applicable law.
J. Notification of significant indirect user status. The MCJM shall notify
the NJDEP, at least annually, which facilities within the sewer service
area meet the definition of "significant indirect user" as set forth at
N.J.A.C. 7:14A-1.2. The MCJM may use a variety of sources to identify
SIUs, including, but not limited, to user surveys, existing MCJM files,
water use and billing records, utility company records, sewer
connection permits, business license records, Chamber of Commerce

rosters, the local telephone directory, property tax records, industrial
directories, newspapers, advertisements, World Wide Web, and drivebys.
Once a potential discharger has been identified, the MCJM may,
if it is uncertain of the operations of that facility, send the user a
questionnaire in order to better evaluate the user's potential of being
classified as an SIU. Alternatively, the MCJM may conduct inspections
of some or all such facilities.
K. Indemnification. The industrial user shall indemnify and save harmless
the MCJM and the Borough of Chatham for any expense, loss, or
damage occasioned the MCJM, by reason of permit violation, the
discharge of process wastewater or any prohibited substance,
including, but not limited to the following:
(1) Any cost incurred by the MCJM in removing, correcting,
preventing, or terminating any adverse effects upon the MCJM
wastewater facilities or wastewater treatment works;
(2) Any increase in the cost of sludge processing or disposal;
(3) Any fines or penalties assessed against the MCJM for such
violations of its permits;
(4) The reasonable costs of any investigative inspection or monitoring
survey which leads to the establishment of a violation of a NJPDES
Significant Indirect User Permit and the reasonable costs of
preparing and litigating any action successfully concluded against
the user for such violation; and
(5) Any other actual or compensatory damages to the MCJM resulting
from the discharge.
A. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors or traps shall be provided for the
proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive

prior to excavation. A jackhammer may be used for the opening if
approval is given by the Director. This shall be indicated on the permit
application. The Director shall make such inspections as he may deem
necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this article.

§ 256-7 NUMBERING OF BUILDINGS § 256-8
188:729

service providers, some unscrupulous towing companies are engaged in
predatory practices victimizing consumers whose vehicles are parked
on public streets and on private property. Such practices are strictly

B. Predatory towing practices include charging unwarranted or excessive
fees, particularly in connection with towing vehicles from private
parking lots which do not display any warnings to vehicle owners, or
overcharging consumers for towing services provided under
circumstances where the consumer has no meaningful opportunity to
withhold consent.
C. The legitimate business interests of towing companies and the needs of
private property owners for relief from unauthorized parking must be
balanced with the interest in providing appropriate protection to
consumers.
D. Therefore, wherever authority exists in the law to regulate towing and
towing companies it is in the public interest to create a coordinated,
comprehensive framework to establish and enforce minimum standards
for tow truck service providers.

preclude a towing company, acting on behalf of a club or
association, from charging members of the club or association a fee
at a rate established by contract between the towing company and
the club or association, which is lower than that rate specified in

provided that membership to such club or association is generally
available to the public.

TANNING BOOTH ESTABLISHMENTS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Massage, bodywork and somatic therapy
establishments  See Ch. 289.
§ 307-1. Title.
This chapter may be cited as the "Tanning Booth Ordinance of the Borough
of Chatham."
§ 307-2. Findings.
Tanning booth establishments have enjoyed a recent, rapid growth in
popularity. The operation of tanning booths involves a serious potential
hazard to the public health, welfare and safety, through the exposure of
persons to concentrations of ultraviolet light in excess of those normally
occurring in the environment. It has been established that acute
overexposure to the ultraviolet light emitted by tanning booth lamps will
cause skin burns and eye damage. It has been established that chronic
exposure to ultraviolet light can result in increased incidences of skin
cancer. Therefore, it is the policy of the Borough of Chatham to protect
the health, welfare and safety of its citizens from the potential hazards
associated with the operation of tanning booth establishments by the
adoption of licensing procedures and standards to govern such facilities.
§ 307-3. Definitions.
Wherever used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:
TANNING BOOTH  Any enclosed or semienclosed area or room,
containing one or more ultraviolet lamps, intended for irradiation of any
part of the human body to induce skin tanning.
TANNING BOOTH ESTABLISHMENT  Any commercial enterprise or
facility containing one or more tanning booths, provided that this definition
shall not include any hospital, clinic or other medical facility wherein
ultraviolet radiation is or may be used, under the supervision of a trained
medical staff, for the diagnosis or treatment of disease.
§ 307-4. License required; application.
A. No person shall, at any time within the Borough of Chatham, conduct,
maintain or operate a tanning booth establishment without first having
obtained a license to do so from the Board of Health of the Borough of
Chatham.
§ 303-7 TANNING BOOTH ESTABLISHMENTS § 307-4
307:785
§ 307-5. Conditions and requirements.
No license to conduct, maintain or operate a tanning booth establishment
shall be granted to any person until such person has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the Board of Health that the following conditions and
requirements have been met:
B. Application for such a license shall be made to the Board of Health, on
forms approved by it, signed and executed by the applicant.
A. Each tanning booth shall have, prominently displayed on its door or
beside its entrance, a sign that states: "DANGER  Ultraviolet
Radiation. Follow instructions. As with natural sunlight, overexposure
can cause injury and sunburn; repeated exposure may cause premature
aging of skin and skin cancer. Exposure of eyes to ultraviolet light
without protective eyewear may cause serious injury to eyes.
Medications or cosmetics applied to the skin may increase
oversensitivity to ultraviolet light, as may a family history of skin
problems or allergy to sunlight. Consult a physician before using this
booth if you are taking any medication or if you believe yourself
sensitive to sunlight."
B. Each tanning booth shall be equipped with handrails, floor markings or

RECITALS
Said Boroughs of Madison and Chatham (hereinafter referred to as
"municipalities") have heretofore by contract dated August 29, 1910,
provided for the joint construction, maintenance and operation of a trunk
sewer and sewage disposal plant pursuant to an act of the Legislature
of the State of New Jersey, entitled "An Act to authorize any two or
more municipalities in this State to jointly provide, maintain and operate
trunk or outlet sewers and sewage disposal plant or plants or a system of
sewerage and to otherwise act jointly concerning the collection, removal or
disposal of sewage and make contracts in relation thereto," approved April
8, 1910. By further contracts between said municipalities made January 2,
1929, July 10, 1950, and November 7, 1968, the parties hereto agreed to
construct, operate and maintain a sewage disposal plant of the activated
sludge type. In accordance with the provisions of said contracts, the parties
hereto have constructed a joint trunk sewer and sewage disposal plant and
have operated and maintained said sewer and plant in Joint Meeting to the
date of this contract.
Pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 63 of Title 40 of the Revised Statutes
of the State of New Jersey, particularly Article 2 thereof, and any other
laws applicable thereto, the parties desire to provide for the continued
maintenance and operation of the existing joint trunk sewer and sewage
treatment and disposal plant in Joint Meeting as authorized by the
aforementioned contracts, and, in order to provide for the better operation
of the system of sewers maintained singly and jointly by the parties hereto,
said parties further desire to provide for the construction of certain
additions to and modifications of the existing sewage treatment and
disposal plant jointly owned by them and located in the Borough of
Chatham, to the end that the system of sewers owned singly and jointly by
the parties hereto may provide necessary and adequate sewage facilities
for the use of and by the inhabitants of said municipalities.
The Borough Councils of said municipalities (being the governing bodies
or boards, authorized by law to have charge of sewer systems established
or to be established in such municipalities) have united and jointly caused
surveys, maps, plan, reports, specifications and estimates (hereinafter
called "plans") to be made by Elson T. Killam Associates, Inc., d/b/a Killam
Associates, for the additions to and modifications of the sewage treatment
and disposal plant. Said plans have been submitted to, considered and
approved by resolutions adopted by the governing bodies of said
municipalities and have been ordered filed, a certified copy of such
approving resolution of each municipality having been served upon the
Clerk of the other municipality. Each municipality has, by ordinance duly
passed and adopted and published as required by law, authorized the
making and entering into, by and on behalf of each municipality of this Joint
Contract.

informed of any proposed changes in his permit at least 30 days prior
to the effective date of the change. Any changes or new conditions in
the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
Section 10. Suspension of sewerage discharge permit.
(1) The Superintendent of the Madison-Chatham Joint Meeting may,
without formal notice, suspend a sewerage discharge permit for a
period not to exceed 45 days when such suspension is necessary in
order to stop a discharge which reasonably appears to present an
imminent or substantial hazard to public health, safety or welfare of
persons.
(2) The Superintendent of the Madison-Chatham Joint Meeting may, after
serving notice on the permittee and allowing the permittee 72 hours
to respond, suspend a sewerage discharge permit for a period not to
exceed 45 days when such suspension is necessary in order to stop
a discharge which presents or may present an endangerment to the
environment or which threatens to interfere with the operation of the
treatment plant.
(3) Any nondomestic user notified of a suspension of his sewer discharge
permit shall immediately cease and desist the discharge of all waste
regulated by the permit. In the event of the failure of the nondomestic
user to comply with the suspension order, the municipality in which
such discharge is taking place shall, after such determination by the
Superintendent of the Madison-Chatham Joint Meeting, prohibit and
prevent such discharge.
(4) Any suspended nondomestic user may file with the Madison-Chatham
Joint Meeting a request for a hearing. Such a request shall not stay
the suspension. In the event of such request, the Operating Committee
of the Madison-Chatham Joint Meeting shall, within 30 days of the
receipt of such request, hold a hearing on the suspension and shall
either confirm or revoke the action. Reasonable notice of the hearing
shall be given to the suspended user as provided in Section 11 of this

through counsel, cross-examine witnesses and present evidence on his
own behalf.
(5) In the event the Operating Committee of the Madison-Chatham Joint
Meeting fails to conduct a hearing within the time set forth above or
fails to make a determination within five days after the close of the
hearing, the order of suspension shall be stayed until the determination
is made either confirming or revoking the action of the Superintendent
of the Madison-Chatham Joint Meeting.
§ A322-1 CHATHAM CODE § A322-1
A322:810
(6) The Superintendent of the Madison-Chatham Joint Meeting shall
reinstate the sewerage discharge permit upon proof of satisfactory
compliance with all discharge requirements.
Section 11. Revocation of a sewerage discharge permit.
(1) The Operating Committee of the Madison-Chatham Joint Meeting may
revoke a sewerage discharge permit if they find that the user has
demonstrated a refusal, inability or failure to take reasonable steps to
comply with any of the provisions of this Article. No revocation shall be
ordered until a hearing has been held by the Operating Committee of
the Madison-Chatham Joint Meeting where the user shall have the right
to be represented by counsel, cross-examine witnesses and present
evidence in his behalf. Notice of the hearing shall be given to the
user at least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing, except that a
hearing may be held on shorter notice if agreed upon by the Operating
Committee of the Madison-Chatham Joint Meeting and the user.
(2) Any nondomestic user whose sewer discharge permit has been revoked
shall immediately cease and desist all discharge of waste regulated
by the permit. The municipality in which such discharge is taking
place will disconnect or permanently block from the public sewer the
connection of any nondomestic user whose permit has been revoked
if such action is necessary to ensure compliance with the order of
revocation.
Section 12. Prohibited wastes.
(1) The sewage treatment and disposal plant is designed for treatment and
disposal of domestic sewage and is dependent largely upon biological
action for disposal of sewage and accordingly may be adversely
affected or rendered inoperative by industrial wastes or other
substances not present in normal domestic sewage.
(2) The right to discharge such industrial wastes will accordingly be
granted by the Madison-Chatham Joint Meeting only under the
following conditions:

in the application indicates that the wastes can be handled without
difficulty by the sewage treatment works and are not prohibited or
restricted by this or any other applicable law or regulation.
(b) If the wastes, as discharged, continue to conform to the quantity
and quality set forth in the application.
(c) If the wastes as discharged are found in continued operation to
have no adverse effect upon plant operation and are not and do not
become prohibited or restricted by this or any other applicable law
or regulation.
(3) Under no circumstances shall substances within the following
classifications be discharged into any sewer or lateral of any user:
§ A322-1 JOINT SEWER SYSTEM CONTRACT § A322-1

Meeting is hereby authorized to adopt such reasonable rules and
regulations not inconsistent with this Article as it deems to be necessary
and proper to implement and enforce the provisions hereof and of any law,
rule, regulation or order imposed upon or affecting the operation of the
Madison-Chatham Meeting, its sewer works, licenses or permits and to
promote the public health, safety and welfare.

connected to the Joint Meeting treatment plant during normal
working hours and at such other times as may be necessary under
emergency conditions as determined by the Superintendent. All
users shall provide easy access to the facilities to be inspected and
shall promptly remove any obstruction which may exist therein
upon the verbal or written request of the Superintendent.
Section 16. Enforcement.
(1) Whenever it is determined by the Madison-Chatham Joint Meeting that
the discharge of any waste into the sewers or laterals is injurious to
the joint sewerage system or adversely affects sewerage treatment, the
municipality in which such discharge is taking place shall, after such
determination by said Madison-Chatham Joint Meeting, prohibit and
prevent such discharge.
(2) In addition, in the event of violation of this Article or any regulation
adopted pursuant hereto, the Madison-Chatham Joint Meeting shall
have recourse to any and all remedies or causes of actions permitted
by law, including but not limited to the right to institute an action in the

seeking fines and penalties and/or an injunction or abatement of any
violation.

to meet the cable-related needs of this community, Cablevision shall
provide a one-time grant of $20,000 to be used by the Borough for
cable-related purposes such as noncommercial PEG access within
Chatham Borough.
D. The Borough agrees that Cablevision shall retain the right to use the
PEG access channel(s), or portion thereof, for non-PEG access
programming, during times when the Borough is not utilizing the
channel for purposes of providing PEG access programming. In the

sidewalks, or trees or shrubs or other landscaping or surfaces in the
natural topography or any other matter whatsoever, Lightower shall, at
its sole cost and expense, reasonably restore and replace such places
and things so disturbed to and in not less than as good condition that
existed prior to each disturbance. In doing so, Lightower shall comply
with all applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations now existing or
hereinafter promulgated. All restorations shall be completed within 30
working days from the occurrence of the disturbance.
13. Permit Required. Prior to the commencement of any work pursuant to
this Agreement, Lightower shall apply to the Municipal Engineer for
a street opening permit in accordance with Article IV of the Code of
the Borough of Chatham. The Municipal Engineer's grant of the permit
shall not be unreasonably withheld.
§ A325-4 COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES FRANCHISE § A325-4

inspections, replacements and repairs of said work in accordance with
to § 244-46 of the Borough Code of the Borough of Chatham.
15. Miscellaneous.
a. No Agency/Partnership. This Agreement neither makes nor
appoints Lightower as an agent of the Municipality, nor does it
create a partnership or joint venture between the parties. Neither
party shall act or represent itself as an agent of the other or purport
to bind or obligate the other in any manner.
b. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is declared invalid
under applicable law, the affected provision will be considered
omitted or modified to conform to applicable law, and all other
provisions will remain in full force and effect.
c. No Waiver. No failure or delay on the part of any party in exercising
any right, power, or remedy under this Agreement will operate
as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any
such right, power, or remedy preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or remedy
hereunder. The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights, powers, or
remedies existing at law, in equity or otherwise.
d. Execution. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each
of which will be deemed an original, but all of which will constitute
one and the same agreement. A signature affixed by a party to
a counterpart of this Agreement and delivered by electronic
transmission is valid, binding and enforceable against such party.

between the parties hereto, and there are no covenants or
agreements to be implied against either party.
f. Amendments. This Agreement will not be amended, or modified
except in writing signed by the parties.
