arising out of alleged violation of any state or federal statute.
INDEMNIFICATION  The reasonable and customary costs incurred in
legal defense of actions covered under this chapter and all sums which
the municipal official would be legally obligated to pay as damages or in
settlement of any claims against the municipal official for matters arising
from or related to such actions, whether the claim is presented during the
period of the municipal official's period of official service with the Borough
or thereafter, and shall include the payment of salary or wages for any
municipal official who, by reason of an indemnified claim, is absent from his
or her Borough work station for the purpose of attending legal proceedings
or other business in connection therewith and the Borough of Closter would
otherwise be responsible for payment of the municipal official's salary or
wages. The term shall not include sums which the municipal official would
be legally obligated to pay in the nature of exemplary or punitive damages.
In the event the municipal official is being sued for such damages, the
Borough shall not indemnify said official with respect to same but shall, to
the extent allowed by law, defend said official in said action and defray the
costs of said defense.
INSURANCE  Coverage afforded by insurance policies of any and every
kind, whether the premium paid by the Borough, the municipal official or

reimbursement pursuant to this chapter unless, within 14 days of the time
such official is served with any summons, complaint, process, notice,
demand or pleading, this official delivers the original or a copy thereof to
the Borough Attorney.
§ 12-5. Civil actions.
§ 12-6. Limitations.
The Mayor and Council shall not approve indemnification of the defense of
any action if:
A. The Borough of Closter is hereby authorized to provide for the defense

and protect such persons from any financial loss resulting from
litigation which arises as described in Subsection B, below.
B. The obligation of the Borough of Closter to defend and indemnify its
officials for acts or omissions arising out of or in the course of the
performance of the duties of that person shall be limited to:
(1) Those circumstances where the acts complained of took place
during a time when the municipal official was actually performing
services on behalf of the Borough of Closter, whether or not during
formal working hours; and
(2) Those circumstances where it reasonably appears that the
municipal official was acting within the scope of his or her duties
for the Borough.

to his or her position subsequent to leaving office, the terms, conditions
and provisions of this section shall apply.

§ 12-3 DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION § 12-6
12:31
§ 12-7. Revocation of indemnification.
The decision to indemnify based upon preliminary investigation is not final
and binding upon the Borough of Closter. Should facts be revealed during
the course of handling the claim, whether or not they could have been
discovered at an earlier time, that show that the municipal official was
acting in a manner which does not entitle him or her to indemnification
for the reasons stated herein, the Mayor and Council may revoke the
indemnification. Further, should the municipal official unjustifiably fail or
refuse to cooperate in defending the claim, indemnification may be revoked.
§ 12-8. Method to provide for defense; attorney's fees.
B. The act or omission complained of was because of actual fraud, willful
misconduct or actual malice.

another, by virtue of which the municipal official is entitled to a defense
of the action in question from the insurer. In the event that the aforesaid
insurance covers less than an entire defense to the particular action,
indemnification shall be approved for that part of the defense not
covered by insurance.
E. The municipal official has failed to deliver the appropriate notice of
claim as required herein.
F. The municipal official fails to cooperate fully with the defense.

H. Defense of the act or omission complained of is not deemed appropriate
by the Mayor and Council pursuant to N.J.S.A. 59:10-1 et seq.
I. The action was brought by the Borough.
J. The legal proceeding involves a question concerning New Jersey
election laws.
K. Nothing in this chapter shall authorize or require the Borough to pay
for punitive or exemplary damages or damages resulting from the
commission of a crime.
A. If the Mayor and Council determines to provide a defense as authorized
by this chapter, it may do so by:
(1) Hiring an attorney of its choice; or
(2) Reimbursing the municipal official for reasonable attorney's fees
and costs incurred in connection with the defense of the legal
proceeding. The obligation to reimburse a municipal official for
§ 12-6 CLOSTER CODE § 12-8
12:32
§ 12-9. Counterclaim or affirmative cause of action.
If the municipal official files a counterclaim, counteraction or asserts any
affirmative cause of action in the legal proceeding, the Borough shall not be
obligated to reimburse for any attorney fees or court costs attributable to
such counterclaim, counteraction or affirmative cause of action.
§ 12-10. Settlement of claims.
By accepting indemnification from the Borough in accordance with this
chapter, the municipal official agrees that the Borough may perform such
investigations and enter into such negotiations on the municipal official's
behalf as the Borough shall deem necessary and may settle any claims,
regardless of whether the Borough actually feels the allegations are
groundless or false. In the event that the municipal official refuses to
consent to any settlement, the Borough shall be liable only for that amount
for which the Borough could have settled the claim for, had the municipal
official consented.
§ 12-11. Construal of provisions.
This chapter shall not create, nor shall be construed as, a contract of
insurance between the Borough and any municipal official. The Borough
shall not be considered an insurer or primary insurer for any purpose and
shall not by this chapter be obligated to settle any claim on a municipal
official's behalf or to tender its limits of coverage in order to avoid excess
liability on the municipal official's part.
§ 12-12. Applicability.
This chapter shall apply to all matters which have not been finally resolved
at the date of enactment hereof, regardless of whether or not the acts for
which damages are sought occurred before passage of this chapter.
Chapter 14
expenses shall arise upon final determination of the legal
proceedings. However, the Borough may reimburse a municipal
official for a portion of expenses incurred prior to a final decision.
B. A resolution shall be adopted appointing counsel for the defense and
determining counsel fees. The hourly rate shall not exceed the rate paid
to the Borough Attorney without a written resolution of the Council.
C. Nothing in this section shall preclude the Mayor and Council from
demanding and reviewing periodically any costs and attorney's fees in
connection with the defense of the municipal official. In the event a
dispute over attorney's fees arises, the Borough reserves the right to
submit the dispute to the Fee Arbitration Committee of the district or
pursue any other course of legal action.

fide emergency of the type referenced above. No work in
addition to the emergency repairs shall be performed until an
appropriate request for approval has been granted by the
Construction Official and the Commission.

[Added 2-14-2007 by Ord. No. 2007:980]
C. Informal review of concept plan for proposed undertakings. At the
request of the applicants considering action that may require
Commission review, the Commission shall grant an informal review of a
concept plan for the proposed undertaking. Neither the applicant not
the Commission shall be bound by any informal review.
A. General criteria for review. In reviewing an application for its effect on
a landmark or a building, structure, or site located within the landmark
district, the following criteria shall be used by the Commission, the
Planning Board, the Zoning Board of Adjustment, the Borough Council
and all other officials and agencies of the Borough responsible for the
administration of this article. The criteria set forth in this subsection
relate to all projects affecting landmarks and any buildings, structures,
objects, and sites located within landmark districts; and, with regard to
such proposed projects, the following factors shall be considered:
(1) The impact of the proposed change on the historic, architectural,
and/or cultural significance of the landmark or landmark district;
§ 35-55 CLOSTER CODE § 35-56
28:114
(2) The importance of the landmark or the building, structure, object,
or site to the nation, state, region, or municipality, and the extent to
which its historic or architectural interest would be adversely
affected to the detriment of public interest;
(3) The use of any landmark or landmark district involved in the
proposed change;
(4) The extent to which the proposed action would adversely affect the
public's view from the street of a landmark, building, structure,
object, or site located within a landmark district;
(5) The impact that the proposed change would have on the
architectural or historic significance of the landmark or landmark
district and the visual compatibility of the proposed change with
adjacent buildings, structures, objects and sites in accordance with
the requirements for design compatibility set forth herein.
B. Rehabilitation of existing buildings, structures, objects, and sites. In
reviewing any application, the Commission shall make its
recommendation as to whether any application should be approved,
approved with conditions, or denied on the basis of the purposes and
the provisions of this article and the following standards for review,
which are identical to the Secretary of the Interior's "Standards for
Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings" as
hereafter may be amended: [Amended 2-14-2007 by Ord. No.
2007:980]
(1) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building,
structure, object, or site and its environment, or to use a property
for its originally intended purpose.
(2) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.
(3) All buildings, structures, objects and sites shall be recognized as
products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis
and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be
discouraged.
(4) Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure,
object, or site and its environment. These changes may have
acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall
be recognized and respected.
(5) Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure, object or site shall be
treated with sensitivity.
§ 35-56 HOUSING AUTHORITY § 35-56
28:115
(6) Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being
replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual
qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features
should be based on accurate duplication of features, substantiated
by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural
elements from other buildings or structures.
(7) The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials shall not be
undertaken.
(8) Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project.
(9) Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and
additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or
cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size,
scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood
or environment.
(10) Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were
to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the
structure would be unimpaired.
C. Design criteria-new construction.
(1) In assessing the design of any proposed addition or new
construction, the Commission shall consider the following design
criteria in conjunction with the standards of rehabilitation and
review criteria set forth above. These design criteria shall be used
to analyze the appropriateness of new construction in the form of
additions and alterations to the landmarks or new construction,
additions, or alterations to buildings, structures, objects, or sites
located within landmark districts.
(a) Height. The height of the proposed structure shall be visually
compatible with adjacent buildings.
(b) Proportion of facade. The relationship of the width of the
building to the height of the front elevation shall be visually
compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually
related.
(c) Proportion of the openings. The relationship of the width of
windows to the height of windows in a building shall be visually
§ 35-56 CLOSTER CODE § 35-56
28:116
compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually
related.
(d) Rhythm of solids. The relationship of solids to voids in the
facade of a building shall be visually compatible with buildings
and places to which it is visually related.
(e) Rhythm of spacing. The relationship of the building to the open
space between it and adjoining buildings shall be visually
compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually
related.
(f) Rhythm of entrances. The relationship of entrances and
porches to the street shall be visually compatible to buildings
and places to which it is visually related.
(g) Relationship of materials. The relationship of materials,
texture, and tone to the facade and roof of a building shall be
visually compatible with the predominant materials used in
buildings to which it is visually related.
(h) Roof. The roof shape of a building shall be visually compatible
with buildings to which it is visually related.
(i) Continuity of walls. Walls and open fencing shall maintain
visual compatibility with buildings and places to which it is
visually related.
(j) Scale. The size of a building mass in relation to open spaces,
window and door openings, porches and balconies shall be
visually compatible with buildings and places to which it is
visually related.
(k) Exterior features. A structure's related exterior features, such
as lighting, fences, sidewalks, driveways and parking areas,
shall be compatible with the features of those structures to
which it is visually related and shall be appropriate for the
historic period for which the structure is significant. New
signage shall also abide by any supplemental historic design or
graphic standards that may be developed by the Commission
for the district.
(2) It is not the intent of this article to discourage contemporary
architectural expression or to encourage new construction which
emulates existing buildings or historical architectural interest or of
a certain period architectural style, but rather to preserve the
integrity and authenticity of a historic preservation district and to
ensure the compatibility of new structures therein.
D. Review criteria for demolition. With regard to applications to demolish
a landmark or any building, structure, object or site located within a
landmark district, the following matters shall be considered:
§ 35-56 HOUSING AUTHORITY § 35-56
28:117
(1) Its historical, architectural, cultural, and aesthetic significance in
relation to the criteria set forth in this article.
(2) Its use, its intended use, and/or the use for which the buildings,
structure, object, or site was originally designed and the feasibility
of the continuation of its designed use.
(3) Its importance to the Borough and the extent to which its historical
or architectural value is such that its removal would be detrimental
to the landmark district and/or to the public interest.
(4) The extent to which it is of such old, unusual, or uncommon design,
craftsmanship, texture, or material that it could not be reproduced
or could be reproduced only with great difficulty.
(5) The extent to which its retention would promote business, create
new positions, attract tourists, students, writers, historians, artists,
or artisans, encourage study and interest in American history,
stimulate interest and study in architecture and design, educate
citizens in American culture and heritage or make the Borough a
more attractive and desirable place in which to live.
(6) The probable impact of its removal upon the ambience of the
landmark district.
(7) The structural soundness and integrity of the building, structure,
object, or site and the economic feasibility for its restoration or
rehabilitation so as to allow for its reasonable use.
(8) The threat to the public health and safety as a result of
deterioration or disrepair of the building, structure, object, or site.
(9) The technological feasibility of structural rehabilitation.
(10) The interference with the charitable purposes of any nonprofit or
charitable organization if demolition is not permitted.
E. Criteria regarding the relocation of historic buildings or structures. The
following factors shall be considered with regard to an application to
move to a new location or site any landmark or any building, structure,
or object located within a landmark district:
(1) The impact of the loss of integrity suffered as a result of the
removal from the original and/or historic location; and, if located
within a historic district, the impact of that loss integrity upon the
district as a whole.
(2) The reasons for not retaining the landmark or structure at its
present site.
(3) The compatibility, nature, and character of the areas adjacent to
both the present site and the proposed site as they relate to the
§ 35-56 CLOSTER CODE § 35-56
28:118
§ 35-57. Certificates of appropriateness.
protection of historic properties and districts as regulated by this
article.
(4) In the event that a proposed new location is in a historic district,
the impact on the visual compatibility of adjacent buildings,
structures, objects or sites as set forth herein.
(5) The likelihood of significant damage to the physical integrity of the
building, structure or object itself.
A. When required. A certificate of appropriateness issued by the
Commission shall be required before a permit is issued or before work
can commence for any of the following activities within a historic
district(s) or on a historic site designated on a zoning map:
(1) Demolition of any building, improvement, site, place, or structure.
(2) Change in the exterior appearance of any building, improvement,
site, place or structure by addition, reconstruction, alteration or
maintenance. Exterior change for all primary and accessory
buildings shall include special consideration of character-defining
features visible from the public right-of-way.
(3) Relocation of a principal or accessory building or structure.
(4) Any addition to or new construction of a principal or accessory
building or structure.
B. When not required.
(1) A certificate of appropriateness shall not be required before a
permit is issued by the Construction Code Official for changes to
the interior of structure or which strictly meet the standards for
ordinary maintenance and repair as defined in this article.
(2) The Construction Official shall review all permit applications to
determine if the application proposes work which constitutes
ordinary maintenance or repair as defined in this article. The
Construction Official may issue a permit if he/she finds that the
work strictly meets the standards for ordinary maintenance and
repair as defined in this article. The Construction Official shall refer
the application to the Historic Preservation Commission if he finds
that the proposed work does not meet the standards for ordinary
maintenance and repair.
C. Application procedures.
(1) The administrative officer shall refer all applications for permits
pertaining to regulated activities involving landmarks or any
buildings, structures, objects, and sites located within landmark
districts to the Commission for a written report on the application
§ 35-56 HOUSING AUTHORITY § 35-57
28:119
of the Zoning Ordinance provisions concerning historic
preservation to any of those aspects of the changes proposed which
were not determined by approval of an application for development
by a municipal agency pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law.
A certificate of appropriateness (hereinafter "C/A"), issued by the
Commission in accordance with the procedures of this article, is
required prior to the commencement of any activities involving
landmarks or properties within landmark districts which are
governed by the provisions of this article.
(2) Applications shall be made on forms available in the office of the
administrative officer in the Closter Borough Hall. Completed
applications shall be delivered or mailed to the administrative
officer at the Closter Borough Hall or may be submitted directly to
the Commission for review and approval.
(3) Upon receipt of an application for a C/A, the Commission shall
schedule a hearing for the purpose of reviewing said application
and shall advise the applicant(s) in writing of the time, date, and
place of said hearing.
(4) Applications shall include a completed application form which
contains a precise written description of the proposed work or
activity and any of the following as may be required by the
Commission:
(a) Photographs of the existing structure or lot;
(b) Scaled drawings showing site plan layout, facade elevations,

decision on the application.
D. Commission review of applications for permits (N.J.S.A. 40:50D-111).
(1) The Commission shall review applications for a C/A at a public
hearing. The applicant(s) shall not be required to appear or to be
represented at any meeting of the Commission at which the
Commission will consider his or her (their) application for a C/A,
regardless of the ultimate findings and a report of the Commission.
(2) As soon as practicable but no later than 45 days after the
administrative officer has referred the application to the
Commission, the Commission shall return to the administrative
officer its written report recommending granting or denying the
§ 35-57 CLOSTER CODE § 35-57
28:120
application, which report may be stated in resolution form. The
Commission shall file a second report with the Planning Board
within 10 days of the Commission's decision on the application.
(3) Appeals from determinations of the Construction Official pursuant
to referral to the Historic Preservation Commission may be made
by the applicant to the Zoning Board of Adjustment, according to
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70a. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the
right of judicial review of the action after an appeal is concluded by
the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The appellant shall pay all costs
for copies of any transcript(s) required for appeal.
(4) The owner shall post the certificate of appropriateness on a
conspicuous spot on the site visible to the public during the entire
process of work.
(5) Issuance of an approval of a permit shall be deemed to be final
approval pursuant to this article. Such approval shall neither cause
nor prevent the filing of any collateral application. The denial of a
permit shall be deemed to preclude the applicant from undertaking
the activity applied for.
(6) When a C/A has been issued, the administrative officer or his
appointee shall, from time to time, inspect the work approved by
such certificate and shall regularly report to the Commission the
results of such inspections, listing all work inspected and reporting
any work not in accordance with such certificate.
(7) Except as hereafter provided, a C/A shall be valid for a period of
two years from date of issue unless reasonable extensions are
requested by the applicant or the Commission. In cases where
demolition is permitted, the C/A shall be valid for one year from the
date of the Historic Preservation Commission approval of the
application. The one-year period shall not be extended.
E. Minor applications. The Chairman of the Historic Preservation
Commission, or a committee of Commissioners appointed by him/her
and acting on his/her behalf, may review applications for minor work,
without holding a public hearing. If the Chairman finds the application
appropriate, he/she may act in place of the full Commission and issue a
certificate for minor work to the Construction Official, who may then
issue a building permit. If the Chairman does not find the application
appropriate, the application should be scheduled for a public hearing
before the full Commission. [Amended 7-10-2002 by Ord. No.
2002:869]
F. Assignment. No assignment of the rights granted by a certificate of
appropriateness shall be permitted.
§ 35-57 HOUSING AUTHORITY § 35-58

The Planning Board and Board of Adjustment shall refer to the Commission
every application submitted to either Board for development in historic
zoning districts or on historic sites designated on the Zoning or Official
Map, or identified in any component element of the Master Plan. The
referral shall be made when the application for development is deemed
complete or is scheduled for a hearing, whichever occurs sooner. Failure
to refer the application as required shall not invalidate any hearing or
proceeding. The Commission may provide its advice, which shall be
conveyed through its delegated members or staff, who shall testify orally at
the hearing and explain any written report which may have been submitted
by the Commission regarding the application. The Commission shall make
available to the applicant a copy of its written report concerning said
application for development.
§ 35-59. Violations and penalties; enforcement.
A. Violations defined. Any person violating any of the provisions of this
article shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to the penalties herein.
A separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day during or on
which a violation occurs or continues. Any person who shall undertake
an activity without approvals required by this article shall be deemed to
be in violation hereof.
B. Notice of violations. Upon learning of the violation, the administrative
officer shall personally serve upon the owner of the property whereon
the violation is occurring a notice describing the violation in detail and
giving the owner 10 days to abate the violation by restoring the
building, structure, or site to its condition prior to the violation. If the
owner cannot personally be served within the Borough with said notice,
a copy shall be posted on the property and a copy shall be sent to the
owner at his or her last known address.
C. Injunctive relief. In the event that the violation is not abated within 10
days of service or posting on site, whichever is earlier, the
administrative office shall cause to be instituted any appropriate action
or proceeding to prevent such unlawful activity, to restrain, correct, or
abate such violation, to prevent the occupancy of said building,
structure, or site, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business, or use
in or about such premises as follows:
(1) If any person shall undertake any activity requiring permit and
report of the Commission without first having obtained approval,
he or she shall be required to immediately stop the activity, apply
for approval, and take any necessary measures to preserve the
affected premises pending such approval. If the work is denied, he
or she shall immediately restore the building, structure, object, or
site to its condition prior to any such activity. The administrative
§ 35-58 CLOSTER CODE § 35-59
28:122
§ 35-60. Preventative maintenance; violations.
officer is hereby authorized to seek injunctive relief regarding a
stop action or restoration in the Superior Court not less than 10
days after the delivery of notice pursuant to Subsection B hereof.
(2) In the event of the threat of imminent action for which the
necessary approvals have not been granted, and which action
would permanently and adversely change a landmark or any
building, structure, object, or site located within a landmark
district, the administrative office is empowered to apply to the
Superior Court of New Jersey for injunctive relief as is necessary to
prevent such actions.
D. Penalties. In addition to the remedies provided above, a person
convicted of a violation of this article before a court of competent
jurisdiction shall be subject to penalties as follows:
(1) For each day up to 10 days, not more than $100 per day.
(2) For each day between 11 days and 25 days, not more than $250 per
day.
(3) For each day beyond 25 days, not more than $500 per day.
(4) For each day beyond 25 days, a jail term, not to exceed 90 days may
be imposed.
A. Priority. Recognizing the need for preventive maintenance to insure the
continued useful life of historic buildings, structures, objects, and sites,
the Borough Council hereby declares that code enforcement for such
designated properties is a high municipal priority.
B. Notice of violation. In the event that any landmark or any building,
structure, object, or site located within a landmark district deteriorates
to the point that, in the best estimate of the administrative officer, the
cost of correcting the outstanding code violations equals more than
10% of the cost of replacing the entire building, structure, object, or
site on which the violation occurs, the administrative officer shall serve
personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, a notice on the
owner of the property listing the violations, the estimate for their
abatement, and the replacement costs of the improvements, and stating
that if the owner does not take all necessary remedial action within 60
days, or such extensions as the administrative officer shall grant for
good cause, the Borough of Closter's designated official may, at the
expiration of said 60 days, enter upon the property and abate such
violations and cause the cost thereof become a lien on the property.
C. Hearing. Upon receipt of such notice, the owner may, within 20 days
after such receipt, notify the administrative officer of his or her
intentions to have a hearing as to the allegations and estimates set forth
in the notice. Such a hearing shall be conducted by the Commission and
§ 35-59 HOUSING AUTHORITY § 35-60
28:123
§ 35-61. Municipal responsibility.
It shall be the duty of all municipal officials of the Borough of Closter
reviewing all permit applications involving any real property or
improvements thereon to determine whether such application involved any
activity which should also be the subject of an application for a permit,
and if it should be, to inform the Secretary of the Commission, the
administrative officer, and the applicant of the same.
shall, so far as possible, be a formal adversary proceeding in which
the administrative officer shall establish matters alleged in the notice
by the preponderance of the evidence. If a hearing is requested, the
administrative officer will, within 10 days following the hearing, serve
on the owner an opinion in writing setting forth his or her conclusions
and the reasons therefor.
D. Action without a hearing. If the owner does not request a hearing, the
findings of the Administrative Officer set forth in the notice issued in
§ 35-59B shall be binding, and the administrative officer may take such
necessary action as granted by the provisions of this article.
E. Right of abatement. If the owner does not comply with the findings of
the administrative officer, the administrative officer may enter onto the
premises and, by use of municipal labor or outside contractors, or both,
perform such work as is necessary to abate all violations.
F. Costs. The administrative officer shall then certify to the Borough
Council the cost of such work performed, plus all administrative,
clerical and legal costs and overhead attributable thereto and shall
present the same to the Borough Council.
G. Lien. The Borough Council may, by resolution, vote to cause the sum so
certified to become a lien upon the property, payable with the next
quarter's property taxes, and, if not then paid, bearing interest at the
same rate as delinquent taxes.

A. The Borough will endeavor to bring employees with temporary
disabilities back on the job as soon as possible and may assign
transitional and/or light duty to employees who temporarily cannot
perform the essential functions of their positions because of injury or
illness. Transitional duty and/or light duty is not guaranteed and will
not exceed 45 workdays unless extended by the Mayor and Council
upon the recommendation of the Borough Administrator.
B. An employee requesting transitional and/or light duty or the Workers
Compensation Physician shall notify the Borough Administrator as soon
as the temporarily disabled employee is able to return to work with
restrictions. Transitional and/or light duty will only be assigned if the
employee will probably be able to perform the essential functions of the
position after the transitional and/or light duty period. The Borough
Administrator will consult with the department head to determine if
there is any meaningful work that can be performed consistent with the
restrictions. Transitional and/or light duty assignments may be in any
department and not just the employee's normal department. The
Borough Administrator will decide if it is in the best interest of the
Borough to approve a transitional and/or light duty request and will
notify the employee of the decision. The Borough reserves the right to
terminate the transitional and/or light duty assignment at any time
without cause.
C. Employees may not refuse transitional and/or light duty assignments
that are recommended by the Workers Compensation Physician. In such
cases, failure to report to work as directed shall constitute immediate
grounds for dismissal. If the employee believes that the transitional
and/or light duty assignment is beyond the employee's abilities, the

salaries and are prohibited from engaging in any outside employment of
any kind unless they receive prior written approval from the Borough
Administrator. If transitional and/or light duty is approved, the
employee or Workers Compensation Physician must keep the Borough
Administrator informed of the medical progress. (Employees assigned
to transitional and/or light duty will be allotted time off to attend
medical or physical therapy appointments but must request leave time
for any other reason.) If at the end of the transitional and/or light duty
period the employee is not able to return to work without restrictions,
the Borough reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to extend the
transitional and/or light duty or place the employee back on workers'
compensation or disability. This policy does not affect an employee's
rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act,59 the Family and
Medical Leave Act,60 the Fair Labor Standards Act,61 the contagious or
life-threatening illnesses policy or other federal or state law.
A. Maternity. Maternity leave may be granted without pay for up to one
year, provided that the request is approved by the department head and

B. Military. Any full-time employee who is a member of the National Guard
or reserve components of the military or naval service of the United
States and is required to perform active duty for training periods shall
be granted a leave of absence with pay for the period of such training.
The amount of such paid leave, unless the employee elects to use his or
her annual vacation leave, shall be the difference between the
employee's salary for the leave period and the amount of money
received from the state or federal government for such service. When
an employee has been called to active duty or inducted into the military
or naval forces of the United States, he or she shall automatically be
granted an indefinite leave of absence without pay for the duration of
such active service. However, in order that the employee may be
reinstated without loss of privileges or seniority, he or she must report
for duty with the Borough within 60 days following his or her honorable
discharge from the military service.
C. Service in court. A full-time employee who is subpoenaed as a witness
in a civil or criminal case, not involving him or her in his or her capacity
as a Borough employee, or an employee who is called and serves on a
jury may be granted paid leave for the period of time in which he or she
is officially involved with the court in such capacity.

Officers and employees  See Ch. 43.
Personnel policies  See Ch. 48.
§ 58-1. Policy.
The Borough of Closter expressly prohibits any form of sexual harassment.
Improper interference with the ability of employees to perform their
expected job duties will not be tolerated. It is Borough of Closter policy that
all employees have a right to work in an environment free of discrimination,
which encompasses freedom from sexual harassment. The Borough of
Closter strongly disapproves of sexual harassment of its employees, in any
form, and states that all employees at all levels of the Borough of Closter
must avoid offensive or inappropriate sexual and/or sexually harassing
behavior at work and will be held responsible for ensuring that the
workplace is free from sexual harassment. All employees, female or male,
shall be permitted to work in an environment free from all forms of unlawful
discrimination and conduct which can be considered harassing, coercive
or disruptive, including sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is a form of
employee misconduct which undermines the integrity of the employment
relationship. Sexual harassment debilitates morale and interferes with work
productivity and, therefore, will not be tolerated.
§ 58-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:

SEXUAL BRIBERY  Includes solicitation of sexual activity or other sexlinked
behavior by promise of reward.
SEXUAL COERCION  Includes coercion of sexual activity by threat of
punishment.
SEXUAL HARASSMENT  Includes any unwelcome sexual advances,
requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct based on

§ 58-3. Guidelines.
§ 58-4. Complaint procedure.
Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term
or condition of a person's employment;

for employment decisions affecting that person;

Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with
a person's work performance; or

A. The borough policy prohibits unwelcome sexual advances; requests for
sexual acts or favors with or without accompanying promises, threats or
reciprocal favors or actions; or other verbal or physical conduct of a
sexual nature which has the purpose or effect of adversely affecting an
employee's performance or which creates a hostile or offensive working
environment. Examples of prohibited conduct include but are not
limited to lewd or sexually suggestive comments; slurs and other
verbal, graphic or physical conduct relating to an individual's sex; or
any display of sexually explicit pictures, greeting cards, articles, comic
books, magazines, photos or cartoons.
B. In order to ensure the integrity of the work environment, supervisory
personnel are required to ensure adherence to and compliance with
this policy and, upon being informed of possible sexual harassment, are
required to take appropriate immediate action in response, including
informing employees of their right to file a discrimination complaint
with the Administrator.
C. Employees are encouraged, whether directly or through a third party,
to notify the alleged harasser that the behavior in question is offensive
and unwelcome. However, failure to do so does not preclude filing a
complaint. Employees are encouraged to promptly report all alleged
incidents of sexual harassment to the Administrator.
A. Who may file.
(1) Any borough employee who feels that he or she has been the victim
of sexual harassment, or who witnessed acts of sexual harassment

of sexual harassment with the following persons in the following
order:

(b) The Borough Administrator.
(c) The Mayor and Council.
(2) Any filing of a complaint against a person other than the
complainant's department head must be accompanied by a
statement that the person to whom the complaint should otherwise
be addressed in accordance with the list hereinabove cannot,
according to the complainant, be objective about the sexual
harassment charge the complainant wishes to file.
B. Contents of complaint.
(1) The initial complaint may be made orally or in writing. If the
complaint is made orally, the Borough Administrator or the

(a) The name, department and position or title of the complainant.
(b) The name, department and position or title of the charged
party.
(c) The date, time, nature and circumstances, in detail, of each
instance of alleged sexual harassment, including but not
limited to the injuries or consequences suffered by the
complainant, the names of any witnesses to such actions and
the duration of the actions at issue.
(d) Whether such harassment has been previously reported and, if

designated as the sexual harassment officer. The Borough Clerk of the
borough is hereby designated as the alternate officer. Persons who, by
reason of the circumstances, are uncomfortable directing a complaint
to the Administrator may report the same to the alternate officer. The
Borough Administrator or alternate officer shall be responsible for the
prompt and thorough investigation of each claim. The investigation
shall be completed within five business days of filing of the complaint,
and a written report of the investigation shall be forwarded to the
Mayor within seven days of the completion of the investigation. A copy

(1) Interview the complainant, potential witnesses and the charged
party;
(2) Review municipal files for similar incidents involving the
complainant and the charged party; and
(3) Assess the presence or absence of corroborative evidence.
D. To the extent possible, the sexual harassment investigative proceedings
will be conducted in manner to protect the confidentiality of the
complainant, the alleged harasser and all witnesses. All parties involved
in the proceedings will be advised to maintain strict confidentiality from
the initial meeting to the final decision, to safeguard the privacy and
reputation of all involved. The investigation shall make every attempt to
maintain the confidentiality of the information provided to the
investigator.
E. A finding of no probable cause as a result of an investigation does not
necessarily establish that an accusation is false. However, this policy
shall not be used to intentionally bring frivolous or malicious charges
against an employee.
A. Standard for determination of guilt. The Borough Administrator or the
alternate officer shall determine that a charged party is not guilty of the
offense of sexual harassment unless he/she/they find, based on the
investigation and hearing, in the case of an appeal, that substantial,
credible evidence supports the conclusion that:
(1) The facts as alleged by the complainant are true;
(2) Those facts constitute sexual harassment defined herein; and
(3) The charged party is the person who committed the act of sexual
harassment.
B. If the validity of the complaint cannot be determined, immediate and
appropriate action will be taken to assure that all parties are
reacquainted with the sexual harassment policy so as to prevent sexual
harassment in the future.
A. Penalties.
(1) In the event of an appeal, the Borough Administrator or the
alternate officer shall be permitted to impose the following
penalties or conditions of employment upon a borough employee
found to have committed the offense of sexual harassment:

collective bargaining agreements and any applicable borough
personnel code provisions.

and Council. The appealing party must file a request for an appeal in
writing with the Borough Administrator within 10 days of the
determination of the Borough Administrator stating why the
determination of the Borough Administrator should be overturned. The
party not appealing shall have the option of submitting, within 10 days
of the filing of the request for an appeal, a statement explaining why the
determination of the Borough Administrator should be affirmed. The
determination by the Mayor and Council shall be a final action.
C. To the extent permitted by law, the borough will not be liable for
damages obtained as a result of a decision of a nonlocal agency or court
of superior administrative remedies described herein.
A. Retaliation. It shall be a violation of this policy for any employee to take
reprisals against any person because she/he has filed a complaint or
testified or assisted in any proceeding under this policy. Threats, other
forms of intimidation, and/or retaliation against the complainant or any
other party based on involvement in the complaint process may be
cause for disciplinary action. There will be no retaliation against
employees for reporting sexual harassment or assisting the borough in
the investigation of a complaint. However, if after investigating any
complaint of harassment or unlawful discrimination the borough learns
that the complaint is not bona fide or that an employee has provided
false information regarding the complaint, disciplinary action may be
taken against the individual who provided the false information.
B. False accusations. Since a charge of sexual harassment is a grave and
serious one, false accusations of sexual harassment are, and will be
treated as, a disciplinary offense and will result in a level of punishment
appropriate for a person actually engaging in such behavior.
§ 58-6 CLOSTER CODE § 58-7
58:198
§ 58-8. Distribution of policy.
A copy of the sexual harassment policy will be distributed to all township
employees and will be posted in a prominent place in the Closter Municipal
Building.

Employees of the borough shall be provided with training, by a person
trained to lead or implement such training, which shall include a detailed
discussion of the following:

alarm console for a limited or permanent time, provided that no such
permit shall be revoked or suspended without giving the permittee an
opportunity to show cause before the Mayor and Council why such
action should not be taken. [Amended 11-24-1980 by Ord. No.

owner is a nonresident of the Borough or his or her post office
address cannot be ascertained, then the notice may be inserted,
once a week for two consecutive weeks, in one of the official
newspapers designated by the Borough.
(3) Failure to comply with notice. In case the owner or occupant of

ARTICLE I
General Regulations
[Adopted 3-23-1983 by Ord. No. 1983:446 (Ch. 41 of the 1967
Code)]
§ 108-1. Findings of fact.
§ 108-2. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
§ 108-3. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
A. The flood hazard areas of the Borough of Closter may be subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected
from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health.
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects.
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges, located
in areas of special flood hazard.
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas. [Amended 1-3-1994 by Ord. No. 1993-663]
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard.
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.

100:287
§ 108-4. Definitions. [Amended 3-11-1987 by Ord. No. 1987:539]
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters.
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging or other development which may
increase flood damage.
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
A. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meanings they have in
common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
B. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:

within the community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year.
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.

special flood hazard.[Amended 7-26-1995 by Ord. No. 1995:701]
ELEVATED BUILDING  A nonbasement building built, in the case of
a building in an area of special flood hazard, to have the top of the
elevated floor or, in the case of a building in a coastal high-hazard
area, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member
of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of
pilings, columns (posts and piers) or shear walls parallel to the flow of
the water and adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural
integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of
the base flood. In an area of special flood hazard, "elevated building"
also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation
perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movement of floodwaters. In areas of coastal high hazard, "elevated
building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of
"elevated building" even though the lower area is enclosed by means of
breakaway walls.
FLOOD or FLOODING  A general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of
inland or tidal waters and/or the usual and rapid accumulation or runoff

construction of a structure on a site such as the pouring of a slab
or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns or
any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation such as clearing, grading and filling nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings or piers or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings such as garages or sheds not occupied

100:295
§ 108-15. General standards for flood hazard reduction. [Amended
3-11-1987 by Ord. No. 1987:539]
In all areas of special flood hazard, the following standards are required:
acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided
that the provisions of Subsection A(4)(a) through (k) have been
fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half ( 1/
2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure. [Amended 7-26-1995 by Ord. No. 1995:701]
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70c.
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance would not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense or create nuisances or
cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
Subsection A(4) or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. The proposed
lowest floor elevation and the lowest opening must be at least 1.0
feet above the base flood elevation which must be established for
each given location.
§ 108-14 CLOSTER CODE § 108-15

proposals and other proposed development which contain at least
50 lots or five acres, whichever is less.
E. Enclosure openings. For all new construction and substantial
improvements, fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are
subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and
exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either
be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must
meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

§ 127-6. Peddlers, hawkers, solicitors and canvassers; license
required; application. [Amended 12-27-1972 by Ord. No. 1972:241;
1-3-1994 by Ord. No. 1993:663; 11-8-1995 by Ord. No. 1995:705;

A. Purpose. The Mayor and Council recognize that a person may have a
right to go from place to place selling one's wares, but not to remain
indefinitely at a fixed location. Abutting property owners, tenants and/
or lawful occupiers of land and buildings have a right to unobstructed
access to their property and the public has a right of passage over
streets and sidewalks. A peddler, as defined in this section, does not
have the right to operate from a fixed place of sale nor on a sidewalk.
Furthermore, because of the transient nature of their business,
peddlers pose special problems to their customers. A customer who
wishes to complain ought to be able to verify a purchase from an
examination of the receipt at the time he or she locates a peddler.
(1) The Mayor and Council further recognize that persons have a
constitutional right to engage in certain expressive activities, but
also that door-to-door canvassing and solicitation creates unique
and legitimate concerns among residents of the Borough about
unwanted intrusions into privacy, potential criminal and/or
fraudulent activities, and overall safety within the community. This
section is enacted under the municipality's general policy to ensure
the safe and orderly flow of pedestrians and vehicular traffic,
protect consumers and avoid altercations between consumers and
peddlers, prevent unwelcome intrusions into residents' privacy, and
promote the general safety and welfare of the community.

requirements.
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural best management practices
(BMPs). Structural BMPs should be integrated with nonstructural
stormwater management strategies and proper maintenance plans.
Nonstructural strategies include both environmentally sensitive site
design and source controls that prevent pollutants from being placed on
the site or from being exposed to stormwater. Source control plans
should be developed based upon physical site conditions and the origin,
the nature, and the anticipated quantity or amount of potential
pollutants. Multiple stormwater management BMPs may be necessary
to achieve the established performance standards for water quality,
quantity, and groundwater recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for major
development, as defined in § 170A-2.
C. Applicability.

measure approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in
perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 170A-8 or found on the Department's
website at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 170A-5, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
§ 170A-4 (RESERVED) § 170A-4
164:453
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading.
"High pollutant loading areas" are areas in industrial
and commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department-approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan; and areas with high risks for
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 170A-5, complete one of
the following:
§ 170A-4 CLOSTER CODE § 170A-4
164:454
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten-, and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at § 170A-2 shall be submitted to
the appropriate Soil Conservation District for review and approval
in accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this
section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
§ 170A-4 (RESERVED) § 170A-4
164:455
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,
expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under an NJPDES permit from this
requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of
rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 170A-8 or found on the Department's
website at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other
sources of technical guidance are listed in § 170A-8. TSS reduction
§ 170A-4 CLOSTER CODE § 170A-4
164:456
shall be calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in
Table 2 below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, P.O. Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (A x B)/100
Where
R = Total TSS percent load removal from application of
both BMPs.
A = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first
BMP.
B = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second
BMP.
Table 2
TSS Removal Rates for BMPs
Best Management Practice TSS Percent Removal Rate
Bioretention systems 90%
Constructed stormwater
wetland
90%
Extended detention basin 40% to 60%
Infiltration structure 80%
Manufactured treatment device See § 170A-6C
Sand filter 80%
Vegetative filter strip 60% to 80%
Wet pond 50% to 90%
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
§ 170A-4 (RESERVED) § 170A-4
164:457
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in § 170A-4F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 170A-8.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable. In no case shall the remaining special water
resource protection area be reduced to less than 150 feet
as measured perpendicular to the top of bank of the
waterway or center line of the waterway where the bank is
§ 170A-4 CLOSTER CODE § 170A-4
164:458
undefined. All encroachments proposed under this
subsection shall be subject to review and approval by the
Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the "Standards for
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
Standard for Off-Site Stability in the "Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq., then the stabilization measures in accordance
with the requirements of the above standards may be placed
within the special water resource protection area, provided
that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS
postconstruction removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to § 170A-4G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
§ 170A-4 (RESERVED) § 170A-4
164:459
§ 170A-5. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in Subsection G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall
a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
special water resource protection area to less than 150 feet
as measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4  Hydrology and
Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds; or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at § 170A-5A(1)(a) and the Rational Method
and Modified Rational Method at § 170A-5A(1)(b). A runoff
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption
prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover have
existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the
time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the
presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the
land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land
§ 170A-4 CLOSTER CODE § 170A-5
164:460
§ 170A-6. Standards for structural stormwater management
measures.
use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and
conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32, A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual; at
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/; or at New Jersey Geological
Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, P.O. Box 427, Trenton, New Jersey
08625-0427; (609) 984-6587.
A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
§ 170A-5 (RESERVED) § 170A-6
164:461
§ 170A-7. Nonstructural stormwater strategies.
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of
the water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the
water quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure
shall be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of
the orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one-inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of § 170A-9D.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosion
resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
§ 170A-9.
B. Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
stormwater management measures may be utilized, provided the
design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its
design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater
recharge and water quality design and performance standards
established by § 170A-4 of this chapter.
C. Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements
of § 170A-4 of this chapter, provided the pollutant removal rates are
verified by the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and
certified by the Department.
A. Strategies.
(1) Buffers. Buffer areas are required along all lot and street lines
separating residential uses from arterial and collector streets,
separating a nonresidential use from either a residential use or
residential zoning district line, and along all street lines where
loading and storage areas can be seen from the street. The buffer
area shall use native vegetation, which requires less fertilization
and watering than nonnative species. Buffer areas may be used for
stormwater management by disconnecting impervious surfaces
and treating runoff from these impervious surfaces. Preservation of
natural wood tracts and limiting land disturbance for new
construction shall be incorporated where practical.
§ 170A-6 CLOSTER CODE § 170A-7
164:462
(2) Curbs and gutters. Curb cuts or flush curbs with curb stops are
encouraged where practical to allow vegetated swales to be used
for stormwater conveyance and to allow for the disconnection of
impervious areas where practical.
(3) Drainage systems. An existing ordinance may require that all
streets be provided with inlets and pipes where the same are
necessary for proper drainage. The use of natural vegetated swales
in lieu of inlets and pipes is encouraged where practical.
(4) Driveways and accessways. The use of pervious paving materials to
minimize stormwater runoff and promote groundwater recharge
should be considered for driveways and accessways where
practical. Consideration should be given for subsurface soil
conditions. The use of crowned driveways is also encouraged to
promote disconnectivity between impervious surfaces and allow
grass areas to promote groundwater recharge.
(5) Natural features. Natural features, such as trees, brooks, swamps,
hilltops, and views, are to be preserved whenever possible, and
that care be taken to preserve selected trees to enhance soil
stability and landscape treatment of the area. In addition, forested
areas shall be maintained to ensure that leaf litter and other
beneficial aspects of the forest are maintained in addition to the
trees.
(6) Nonconforming uses, structures or lots. The existing ordinance
may allow an applicant/owner of an existing use to propose
additions or alterations that exceed the permitted building and/or
lot coverage percentages. The applicant should mitigate the impact
of the additional impervious surfaces unless the stormwater
management plan for the development provided for these increases
in impervious surfaces. This mitigation effort must address water
quality, flooding and groundwater recharge.
(7) Off-site and off-tract improvements. Any off-site and off-tract
stormwater management and drainage improvements shall
conform to the "Design and Performance Standards" described
herein and in the Borough Code.
(8) Off-street parking and loading. Where practical, parking lots with
more than 10 spaces and all loading areas should allow for flush
curb with curb stop or curbing with curb cuts to encourage
developers to allow for the discharge of impervious areas into
landscaped areas for stormwater management. The use of natural
vegetated swales for the water quality design storm, with overflow
for larger storm events into storm sewers, should be utilized where
practical. A developer may demonstrate that fewer spaces would be
required, provided that area is set aside for additional spaces if
necessary. Pervious paving could be provided for overflow parking
areas.
§ 170A-7 (RESERVED) § 170A-7
164:463
§ 170A-8. Sources for technical guidance.
(9) Performance standards. Pollution source control must be evaluated
in order to prohibit materials or wastes from being deposited upon
a lot in such form or manner that they can be transferred off the lot,
directly or indirectly, by natural forces such as precipitation,
evaporation or wind. Materials and wastes that might create a
pollutant or a hazard shall be enclosed with appropriate measures/
devices.
(10) Shade trees. The existing ordinance requires shade trees to be
planted along the street on which the building fronts. In addition to
this section, the Borough may have a Tree Preservation Ordinance
that restricts and otherwise controls the removal of mature trees
throughout the Borough.122 This chapter should recognize that the
preservation of mature trees and forested areas must be
considered in the management of environmental resources,
particularly watershed management, air quality, and ambient
heating and cooling. A critical disturbance area that extends
beyond the driveway and building footprint where clearing of trees
cannot occur shall be depicted on the plan minimizing land
disturbance. Identification of forested areas and the percentage of
wooded areas be protected from disturbance shall also be
provided.
(11) Sidewalks. Sidewalks should be designed to discharge stormwater
to neighboring lawns where feasible to disconnect these
impervious surfaces or use permeable paving materials where
appropriate.
(12) Soil erosion and sediment control. The applicant shall comply with
the New Jersey Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Standards and/
or the Borough's Soil Movement Ordinance123 as applicable and
should incorporate procedures to retain and protect natural
vegetation; minimize and retain water runoff to facilitate
groundwater recharge; and install diversions, sediment basins, and
similar required structures prior to any on-site grading or
disturbance.

found in the NJDEP Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual,
April 2004, as amended.

A. This section sets forth requirements to protect public safety through
the proper design and operation of stormwater management basins.
This section applies to any new stormwater management basin. The
provisions of this section do not preempt more stringent municipal or
county safety requirements for new or existing stormwater
management basins. Municipal and county stormwater management
plans and ordinances may, pursuant to their authority, require existing
stormwater management basins to be retrofitted to meet one or more of
the safety standards in § 170A-9B(1), (2) and (3) for trash racks,
overflow grates, and escape provisions at outlet structures.
B. Requirements for trash racks, overflow grates and escape provisions.
(1) A trash rack is a device designed to catch trash and debris and
prevent the clogging of outlet structures. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet from the stormwater
§ 170A-8 (RESERVED) § 170A-9
164:465
management basin to ensure proper functioning of the basin
outlets in accordance with the following:
(a) The trash rack shall have parallel bars, with no greater than
six-inch spacing between the bars.
(b) The trash rack shall be designed so as not to adversely affect
the hydraulic performance of the outlet pipe or structure.

[Adopted 8-12-1992 by Ord. No. 1992:622]
§ 171-29. Responsibility of owners.
A. Duties.
(1) It shall be the duty of all owners of property abutting upon streets,
avenues or highways of the borough where sidewalks have been
constructed to maintain the sidewalks in front of their premises in a
safe, passable and serviceable condition and free from obstruction
of grass, weeds, sediments or other material. It shall be the duty of
said property owners to repair, construct, alter or relay said
sidewalks so as to keep them free of cracks and crevices and on an
even grade.
(2) All owners of property abutting upon streets, avenues or highways
of the borough who apply for a building permit for new
construction of an improvement upon vacant land, which does not
require site plan approval, shall be required to construct sidewalks
and curbs in accordance with the standards of § 173-48E. The term
"vacant land" shall include a parcel of land where the existing
structure will be removed and replaced with construction of a new
improvement. No certificate of occupancy shall be granted until
this provision is met. The Building Department/Zoning Officer shall
notify the owner of the requirement to install a sidewalk and curbs.
The owner may request a waiver of this requirement from the
Mayor and Council. The request shall be made within 20 days of
notification and shall be in writing, setting forth the reasons for the
waiver. The Mayor and Council shall schedule a hearing to consider
the waiver request. Upon construction and acceptance, the owner
shall have the duty to maintain the sidewalk and curb in
accordance with Subsection A(1)above. [Amended 5-13-1998 by
Ord. No. 1998:760]
B. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, where any property
owner shall, having received a notice of required compliance from the
Property Maintenance Officer, fail or neglect to maintain, construct,
repair, alter or relay the sidewalks in front of or abutting his or her
property in a safe, passable and serviceable condition, the governing
body may pass a resolution causing a notice to be served, in writing,
upon the owner or occupant of said land requiring the specified
maintenance or repairs to be done within a period of 30 days from the
date of service of said notice. The notice shall be served in person upon
the owner or occupant by leaving the same at his or her usual place of
residence with a member of the family over the age of 14 years.
Whenever any lands are unoccupied and the owner cannot be found
within the municipality, notice may be mailed, postage prepaid, to his or
her post office address, if the same can be ascertained. In case such
§ 171-29 (RESERVED) § 171-29
164:485
owner is a nonresident and his or her address cannot be ascertained,
then notice may be inserted for four weeks, once a week, in a
newspaper circulating in the municipality and shall also be posted upon
the affected premises. In the event that an owner of property shall be
granted a waiver from any of the provisions of this section, including
but not limited to the obligation to construct sidewalks and curbs, the
borough shall condition such waiver upon the owner's contribution to a
fund dedicated to the repair, replacement and construction of sidewalks
within the borough. Such monetary contribution shall be in the sum
established by the Borough Engineer and shall be based on the amount
of linear feet of sidewalk and/or curb the owner would otherwise be
required to construct. [Amended 8-13-1997 by Ord. No. 1997:747;
6-9-1999 by Ord. No. 1999:792; 3-8-2017 by Ord. No. 2017:1221]
C. Failure to comply. [Amended 8-13-1997 by Ord. No. 1997:747]
(1) If the owner refuses or neglects to comply with the notice within 30
days after service or publication, the Property Maintenance Officer
is authorized and empowered to effect such repairs and
improvements with borough personnel or with independent
contractors, in his or her discretion, as will eliminate the
objectionable condition. When any such work shall be done, a true
and accurate account of the costs shall be kept and distributed
among the properties abutting upon the sidewalk in due proportion
to the amount of material and labor expended upon each parcel of
property involved, and a true statement and report of the cost
under oath or affirmation shall be filed forthwith by the Property
Maintenance Officer with the Borough Clerk and Tax Assessor. The
Property Maintenance Officer shall also file with the Borough Clerk
proof of service or publication of the notice of demand.
(2) Upon the filing of a statement or report by the Property
Maintenance Officer, the Borough Council shall cause notice to be
given to the owner of all properties affected designating the time
and place when the report and statement will be considered and
confirmed by the Borough Council. At the time and place
designated, the Borough Council shall afford an opportunity for all
parties in interest to be heard. After the hearing, the Council may
make such changes or amendments as appeared to be just and
proper. The Council may thereafter confirm the report with or
without amendments, and it shall then be transmitted to the
Collector of Taxes.
D. Upon receipt of the report from the Borough Council, the Tax Collector
shall enter upon his or her books and records the proper charges
against the respective properties affected, levying assessments thereon
in the proper amounts in the same manner provided by law for the
levying of assessments for street improvements. The Collector of Taxes
shall have the power to enforce collection of the assessments in the
same manner provided by law for the enforcement of payments of taxes
and assessments. The assessment shall bear interest at the same rate

confirmation by the Borough Council.
E. In the event that any sidewalk, curb, driveway apron or gutter
construction or maintenance will involve the removal of any tree or part
thereof, including roots, situated between the edge of the sidewalk and
the curb and it is the tree or part thereof, including a root, which has
caused the deteriorated, broken or hazardous sidewalk, the property
owner shall secure written approval for the necessary work from the
Shade Tree Commission of the Borough of Closter. It shall be the
obligation of the abutting property owner to obtain the necessary
permit from the Shade Tree Commission and to perform the work
permitted, said work to be accomplished in a manner and with the
workmanship approved by the Shade Tree Commission during the
permit process. If the Shade Tree Commission refuses to issue a permit
pursuant to this subsection, it shall send written notice of denial to the
Property Maintenance Officer and the Borough Clerk as well as the
property owner. In the event that the Shade Tree Commission has
denied the permit or fails to take any action within 30 days from
application for a permit, the property owner shall be relieved of his or
her obligation to comply with the notice to repair the sidewalk only to
the extent that a tree or a portion of the tree or its roots interferes with
said repair work. [Amended 8-13-1997 by Ord. No. 1997:747]

Superintendent of Public Works or the Borough Engineer. In the event
that a waiver is granted, the contractor or owner shall cover the
excavation with heavy one-inch-thick steel plates secured to existing

barriers and lights around the entire excavation and arrange to provide
appropriate security protection, if such security is necessary, at his or

and sloped. In no event shall an excavation be left open for more than
72 hours unless an emergency exists and permission has been secured

anticipated inspection and professional expenses, said fund shall
be subject to increase on demand of the Building Department.
[Amended 12-13-2017 by Ord. No. 2017:1234]

the work, it appears evident to the Superintendent of the Department
of Public Works or the Borough Engineer that the escrow deposit
fee is or will be insufficient to cover all costs of inspection and/or
other professional services, additional escrow deposit fees shall be
estimated by the Superintendent of the Department of Public Works or
the Borough Engineer and paid to the Boroughs Building Department,
based on a revised work schedule to be submitted by the applicant.
This procedure shall be repeated as often as necessary to guarantee
sufficient escrow deposit fees being available. [Amended 12-13-2017

or will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining

adversely affect any municipal considerations concerning the
health, safety or general welfare. If the Planning Board
Subcommittee makes this determination, it shall, in writing,

1981:404]
A. Except as provided herein, no building permit shall be issued for a
building, structure or use or any enlargement, expansion or change of
use unless a site plan is first submitted and approved by the approving
authority.
B. No certificate of occupancy shall be given unless all construction and
conditions conform to the site plan as approved, unless conditionally
approved by the approving authority as provided herein.
A. Site plan review shall not be required for single-family detached
dwellings or for such accessory uses as a private garage, toolhouse,
garden and private greenhouses, swimming pools and other similar
uses incidental to a single detached dwelling or for similar
improvements as accessory uses to a principal use.
B. Site plan approval shall not be required where: [Amended 3-13-1985

not involve structural changes or enlargements of the building, as
defined in the Uniform Construction Code of the State of New
Jersey.
(2) Renovations or alterations to the exterior or interior of any building
or structure do not involve any enlargement of the building or
major structural change, as defined in the Uniform Construction
Code of the State of New Jersey.
C. However, the Construction Code Official shall refer any application for a
building permit to the approving authority for site plan approval, §
173-27B(1) and (2) notwithstanding, where the construction,
reconstruction, alteration or change of use will affect circulation, water
supply, sewage disposal, drainage, landscaping, signs, lighting, offstreet
parking or loading or the lack of any or all of these factors,
environmental factors and other considerations as specified in this
chapter.
D. Except as provided in § 173-27B(1) and (2) herein, all construction or
enlargement of a building or structure shall require site plan approval.
However, any change in use to a permitted use within the zoning

Officer and/or the Construction Code Official, there has been a material
change in the use of the property contrary to the statements contained
in the users documentation, then the user may be required to apply to
the appropriate board for approval of the use, as otherwise set forth
in Chapter 173 of the Closter Code. In addition, where the change of
use will have a more adverse effect than the existing use on circulation,
water supply, sewage disposal, drainage, landscaping, signs, lighting,
off-street parking or loading or the lack of any of these factors,
environmental factors and other considerations as specified in this
chapter, site plan approval will be required. [Amended 3-13-1985 by

In reviewing any application for site plan approval, conditional use
approval, planned development or combinations thereof, the approving
authority, advisory boards, professional advisers and the applicant shall be
guided by the general and specific requirements contained herein.
A. Circulation.
(1) The circulation system shall consider pedestrian and vehicular
traffic movement within and adjacent to the plat, with particular
emphasis on the provision and layout of parking areas, off-street
loading and unloading, movement of people, goods and vehicles
from access roads, within the site and between buildings and
vehicles.
(2) All parking spaces shall be usable and safely and conveniently
arranged. Access to the site from adjacent roads shall be designed
so as to interfere as little as possible with traffic flow on these roads
and to permit vehicles a rapid and safe ingress to and egress from
the site.
B. Building design and layout. The design and layout of buildings and
parking areas shall be reviewed so as to provide an aesthetically
pleasing design and efficient arrangement. Particular attention shall be
given to safety and fire protection; impact on the surrounding
development; contiguous and adjacent buildings and lands; and
environmental and ecological considerations.
C. Lighting. Adequate lighting shall be provided to ensure safe movement
of persons and vehicles and for security purposes. Directional lights
shall be arranged so as to minimize glare and reflection on adjacent
properties.
D. Buffering. Buffering, where required, shall be located around the
perimeter of the site to minimize headlights of vehicles, noise, light
from structures and the movement of people and vehicles and to shield
activities from adjacent properties. Buffering may consist of fencing,
evergreens, shrubs, bushes, deciduous trees or combinations thereof to
achieve the stated objectives.
E. Landscaping. Landscaping shall be provided as part of the overall plan
and shall be designed and integrated into building arrangements,
topography, parking and buffering requirements. Landscaping shall
include trees, bushes, shrubs, ground cover, perennials, annuals,
plants, sculpture, art, street furniture and the use of building and
paving materials in an imaginative manner.
§ 173-47 (RESERVED) § 173-47
164:563
§ 173-48. Off-street parking requirements.
F. Signs. Signs shall be designed so as to be aesthetically pleasing,
harmonious with other signs on the site and located so as to achieve
their purpose without constituting hazards to vehicles and pedestrians.
G. Utilities.
(1) Storm drainage, sanitary waste disposal, water supply and solid
waste disposal shall be reviewed and considered. Particular
emphasis shall be given to the adequacy of the existing systems and
the need for improvements to adequately carry runoff and sewage
and to maintain an adequate supply of water at sufficient pressure.
(2) Solid waste disposal shall be reviewed to ensure frequent
collection, protection against vermin and rodents and aesthetic
considerations. All systems shall meet municipal specifications as
to installation and construction.
(3) Newly installed utility lines shall be installed underground. This
section shall take precedence over § 171-33D, which prohibits
opening of a road within three years of the time that the road is
sealed. [Added 10-24-2007 by Ord. No. 2007-994]
H. Environmental considerations.
(1) Environmental elements relating to soil erosion and sedimentation,
preservation of trees, protection of watercourses and water quality,
noise pollution, topographic limiting areas, wetland areas and
other environmental and ecological factors will be reviewed, where
appropriate, to minimize adverse development affects.

offensive noise to the general public.
I. Compliance with Master Plan and municipal codes and ordinances. The
site plan shall be consistent with the Master Plan of the Borough of
Closter or any portion thereof adopted by the Closter Borough Planning
Board, as well as all Borough codes and ordinances, including Chapter
200, Zoning, and the Official Map.
A. Number of parking spaces required. The number of off-street parking
spaces required shall be as set forth in Table X-1 below. If determination
of the number of required parking spaces results in a fractional space,
the fraction shall require one additional parking space.
B. Location of parking spaces.
(1) The approving authority shall approve the location of all proposed
parking spaces on the site and shall take into consideration the size
and topography of the site, visibility from the site to the adjoining
street, as well as within the parking area, conditions of safety
relating to the movement of people and vehicles and the
§ 173-47 CLOSTER CODE § 173-48
164:564
elimination of nuisance factors, including glare, noise, dust and
other similar considerations.

(f) Geometric design. The geometric design of a driveway
connection to a public or private street shall be governed by
sound traffic engineering principles. The following guidelines
are utilized in preparing a geometric design, but some
deviation may be necessitated from time to time due to the
many variables encountered in the course of preparing a
design. The applicant should be aware, therefore, that
although the driveway layout may conform to these guidelines,
conditions may dictate deviations from them, and the
requirements of the Municipal Engineer shall be final.
[1] Two-way operation. Driveways used for two-way operation
will intersect a public or private street at an angle to as
near 90° as site conditions will permit, and in no case will
the angle be less than 60°.
[2] One-way operation. Driveways used for vehicles in one
direction of travel (right turn only) shall not form an angle
smaller than 45° with a public street.
[3] The dimensions of driveways shall be designed to
adequately accommodate the volume and character of
vehicles anticipated to be attracted daily onto the land
§ 173-48 CLOSTER CODE § 173-48
164:570
development for which a site plan is prepared. The
required maximum and minimum dimensions for
driveways connecting to a public or private street at 90°
are indicated in Table X-4. Driveways serving large
volumes of daily traffic or traffic over 25% of which is
truck traffic shall be required to utilize high to maximum
dimensions. Driveways serving low daily traffic volumes
or traffic less than 25% of which is truck traffic shall be
permitted to use low to minimum dimensions.
[4] Any vertical curve on a driveway shall be flat enough to
prevent the dragging of any vehicle undercarriage.
[5] Should the sidewalk be so close to the curb at a depressed
curb driveway as to cause the ramp to be too steep and be
likely to cause undercarriage drag, the sidewalk shall be
appropriately lowered to provide a suitable ramp gradient.
(g) The surface of any driveway shall be constructed with a
permanent pavement of a type specified by standards set by
the Municipal Engineer. Such pavement shall extend to the
paved portion of the public or private street pavement.
(5) Guardrails, wheel stops and parking lot striping.
(a) Guardrails shall be provided in appropriate locations where
required for safety purposes.
(b) Wheel stops, permanently anchored to the ground, may be
required in appropriate locations. Parked vehicles shall not
overhang or extend over sidewalk areas, unless an additional
sidewalk width of two and one-half (2 1/2) feet is provided to
accommodate such overhang.
(c) Parking stalls, driveways and aisles shall be clearly marked
and delineated. The approving authority may require that
certain areas be maintained for fire-fighting purposes or other
emergency purposes. These areas, as well as other pavement
signage, shall be appropriately designated.
(6) Minimum and maximum grades in parking areas. The minimum and
maximum parking grades shall be in accordance with the following
requirements:

Driveway intersections with any roadway within a distance of 35
feet from the curbline, as measured along the center line of the
driveway, shall not exceed a grade of 1.5%.
(7) Maintenance of off-street parking and loading areas. Every parcel
of land used as a public or private off-street parking or loading area
shall be maintained in good condition, free of hazards and
deterioration. All pavement areas, sidewalks, curbs, drainage
facilities, lighting, bumpers, guardrails, markings, signs,
landscaping and other improvements shall be maintained in
workable, safe and good condition.
(8) Waiver of parking requirements. If any applicant can clearly
demonstrate to the approving authority that, because of the nature
of the operation or use, the parking requirements of this section
are unnecessary or excessive, the approving authority shall have
the power to approve a site plan showing less paved parking area
than required by this section; provided, however, that a landscaped
area of sufficient size to meet the deficiency shall be set aside and
reserved for the purpose of meeting future off-street parking
requirements in the event that a change of use of the premises shall
make such additional off-street parking spaces necessary.
(9) Other off-street parking requirements.
(a) Limitations as to use. All off-street parking areas shall be used
solely for the parking of passenger automobiles, and no
commercial repair work or service of any kind shall be
conducted on such parking lot.
§ 173-48 CLOSTER CODE § 173-48
164:572
(b) Nonavailability. At any time that the required off-street parking
facilities cease to be available as required, the certificate of
occupancy for the building or buildings built in conjunction
with such parking areas shall be canceled and become null and
void.
(c) Charges. There shall be no charge made for the use of offstreet
parking facilities and no cars other than self-propelled
passenger vehicles shall be permitted to use any of the offstreet
parking facilities herein required, and no service of any
kind shall be extended to the vehicle occupying such off-street
parking facilities, except for emergency purposes.
(d) Traffic markers; paint striping.
[1] The side perimeter of each parking space shall be
delineated by painted lines on the pavement for the length
of the parking space. The width of all lines shall not be less
than four inches nor more than six inches and shall be
uniform in the entire parking area. A second set of lines
shall also be painted on the ground for each space, which
lines shall each be parallel to the perimeter lines.
[2] One-way aisles shall be marked with directional arrows on
the ground not less than eight feet long with directional
arrows at each end of the aisle. Two-way aisles shall be
marked with two directional arrows on the ground, each
not less than eight feet long. Two-way aisles shall also be
marked with a center line not less than four inches wide.
Parking aisles that lead to private roadways or driveways
on the property shall be marked with stop signs in every
case where there are more than 20 parking spaces
provided off any aisle that leads into another interior
roadway or driveway.
[3] All traffic markers, traffic signs, traffic signals and traffic
control devices shall be constructed, erected, delineated
and maintained in accordance with the standards,
regulations and requirements set forth in the Manual on
Uniform Traffic Control Devices, prepared by the United
States Department of Transportation, Federal Highway

designated for physically handicapped persons. Said spaces
shall be the most accessible and approximate to the building or
buildings which the parking spaces serve.
(b) Each space or group of spaces shall be identified with a clearly
visible sign displaying the international symbol of access along
with the following wording: "These spaces reserved for
physically handicapped drivers."
(c) Each space shall be 12 feet wide to allow room for persons in
wheelchairs or on braces or crutches to get in and out of either
side of an automobile onto a level, paved surface suitable for
wheeling and walking.
(d) Where possible, such spaces shall be so located that persons in
wheelchairs or using braces or crutches are not compelled to
wheel or walk behind parked cars.
(e) Where applicable, curb ramps shall be provided to permit
handicapped people access from parking areas to sidewalks.
(4) Sidewalks. A sidewalk hereafter constructed or reconstructed on
public or private property for public use shall be constructed in a
manner that will facilitate use by physically handicapped persons.
At points of intersection between pedestrian and motorized lines of
travel and at other points where necessary to avoid abrupt changes
in grade, a sidewalk shall slope gradually to the street level so as to
provide an uninterrupted line of travel.
D. Architectural screening of mechanical equipment. Architectural
screening of any mechanical equipment on the roof or outside of any
building shall be installed so as to screen the mechanical equipment
from view. "Architectural screening," for the purposes of this section,
shall be deemed to mean the use of metal, stone or other relatively
maintenance-free materials in slats or other designs so as to screen and
prevent the direct view of the mechanical equipment. The term
"mechanical equipment" includes any fans, air-conditioning equipment,
§ 173-55 (RESERVED) § 173-55
164:583
elevator housing, water towers, compressors, heating equipment and
any other equipment of any kind.
E. Screening and confinement of materials.
(1) Any materials left or kept outside of a building shall be screened
and kept within limited confines. Any material, trash or refuse or
any combination thereof kept or left outside of a building and any
containers for said material shall either be:
(a) Finished and screened in a manner shown on the proposed site
plan designed to meet the applicable requirements herein;
(b) Enclosed on all four sides with the same material that is used
for the outer surface of the exterior walls of the building
adjacent thereto except for entry gates; or
(c) Enclosed and screened in any other manner approved by the
approving authority, provided that the same is designed to
effectively confine the material within the enclosed area and to
screen the same from other areas outside the building and is a
material that is not likely to create problems of maintenance,
sanitation or a nuisance.
(2) Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the storage
of any material in any zone where such use of the property is not
otherwise permitted by the Zoning Ordinance167 and all applicable
laws and regulations. If the applicant does not propose any outside
storage of said materials, the plan shall so indicate. The applicant
shall not thereafter store any of said materials outside of the
building unless a plan is submitted to and approved by the
approving authority for said purpose.
F. Fencing. The site plan shall show the location, specifications and height
of any fencing required under any ordinance of the Borough of Closter
and of any fencing proposed by the applicant. The approving authority
may require additional fencing for reasons of traffic or pedestrian
safety in connection with the particular problems associated with the
property under consideration and its proposed use.

On-Tract Improvements
§ 173-56. Required improvements.
§ 173-57. Performance guaranty.
A. Before recording final subdivision plats or approving site plan plats, the
approving authority shall require that the applicant shall have installed
or shall have furnished performance guaranties for the installation of
on-tract improvements in accordance with borough specifications as
follows: streets, street signs, grading, pavement, curbs, gutters,
sidewalks, walkways, streetlighting, shade trees, water mains, fire
hydrants, culverts, storm sewers, sanitary sewers or other means of
sewage disposal, drainage structures, erosion control and sediment
control devices, public improvements of open space and surveyor's
monuments as required by the Map Filing Law, P.L. 1960, c. 141
(N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.).
B. All such required improvements shall be certified by the Borough
Engineer unless the applicant shall have filed a performance guaranty
sufficient in amount to cover the cost of all such improvements or
uncompleted portions thereof as estimated by the Borough Engineer.
A. The performance guaranty shall be furnished in favor of the borough in
an amount equal to 120% of the cost of installation for improvements it
may deem necessary or appropriate, as specified in § 173-56 herein.
B. The time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the
performance guaranty has been provided may be extended by the
governing body by resolution. As a condition or as part of any such
extension, the amount of any performance guaranty shall be increased
or reduced, as the case may be, to an amount not to exceed 120% of the
cost of the installation as determined as of the time of the passage of
the resolution. [Amended 4-21-1980 by Ord. No. 1980:372]
C. If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guaranty, the obligor and surety, if
any, shall be liable thereon to the borough for the reasonable cost of the
improvements not completed or corrected, and the borough may either
prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof complete such
improvements.
D. Upon substantial completion of all required appurtenant utility
improvements and the connection of the same to the public system, the
obligor may notify the governing body, in writing, by certified mail
addressed in care of the Municipal Clerk, of the completion or
substantial completion of said improvements and shall send a copy
thereof to the Municipal Engineer. Thereupon, the Municipal Engineer
shall inspect all of the improvements of which such notice has been
given and shall file a detailed report, in writing, with the governing
§ 173-56 (RESERVED) § 173-57
164:585
§ 173-58. Maintenance guaranty.
body, indicating either approval, partial approval or rejection of such
improvements, with a statement of reasons for any rejection. If partial
approval is indicated, the cost of the improvements as approved or
rejected shall be set forth. [Amended 4-21-1980 by Ord. No.
1980:372]
E. The governing body shall either approve, partially approve or reject the
improvements on the basis of the report of the Municipal Engineer and
shall notify the obligor, in writing, by certified mail, of the contents of
said report and the action of said approving authority with relation
thereto not later than 65 days after receipt of the notice from the
obligor of the completion of the improvements. Where partial approval
is granted, the obligor shall be released from all liability pursuant to its
performance guaranty, except for that portion adequately sufficient to
secure provision of the improvements not yet approved, provided that
30% of the amount of the performance guaranty posted may be retained
to ensure completion of all improvements. Failure of the governing
body to send or provide such notification to the obligor within 65 days
shall be deemed to constitute approval of the improvements, and the
obligor and surety, if any, shall be released from all liability, pursuant to
such performance guaranty for such improvements. [Amended
4-21-1980 by Ord. No. 1980:372]
F. If any portion of the required improvements are rejected, the approving
authority may require the obligor to complete such improvements and,
upon completion, the same procedure of notification as set forth in this
section shall be followed.
G. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the
obligor to contest, by legal proceedings, any determination of the
governing body or the Borough Engineer.
H. The obligor shall reimburse the municipality for all reasonable
inspection fees paid to the Municipal Engineer for the foregoing
inspection of improvements, provided that the municipality may require
of the developer a deposit for all or a portion of the reasonably
anticipated fees to be paid to the Municipal Engineer for such
inspection. [Amended 4-21-1980 by Ord. No. 1980:372]
I. In the event that final approval is by stages or sections of development
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-38, the provisions of this section shall be
applied by stage or section. [Added 4-21-1980 by Ord. No.
1980:372]
A. Prior to the acceptance of any improvement herein, a maintenance
guaranty shall be furnished in favor of Closter Borough for a period not
exceeding two years after final acceptance of the improvement, in an
amount not to exceed 15% of the cost of the improvement.
§ 173-57 CLOSTER CODE § 173-58
164:586
§ 173-59. Other governmental agencies or public utilities.
In the event that other governmental agencies or public utilities
automatically will own the utilities to be installed or the improvements
are covered by a performance or a maintenance guaranty to another
governmental agency, no performance or maintenance guaranty, as the case
may be, shall be required by the borough for such utilities or improvements.
§ 173-60. Inspection and approval.
All improvements listed in Articles XI and XII shall be subject to inspection
and approval by the Borough Engineer, who shall be notified by the
applicant at least 24 hours prior to the start of construction. No
underground installation shall be covered until inspected and approved.
B. Simultaneous with the submission of a maintenance guaranty, the
applicant shall file with the borough as-built drawings accurately
showing the location, profile and size of all storm drains, catch basins,
sanitary sewers, water mains and all utility and service connections
constructed in the subdivision or site plan.

ARTICLE XII
Off-Tract Improvements
§ 173-61. When required.
§ 173-62. Approving authority determination.
Each subdivision or site plan requiring approving authority action shall be
subject to a determination and findings as follows:
A. Any subdivision or site plan requiring off-tract improvements, as
defined herein, shall comply with the provisions of this section of this
chapter.
B. An off-tract improvement shall be one or more required improvements
which are necessary for the successful completion of a development in
the interest of furthering the public health, safety and general welfare,
and where said improvements are located off-tract.
C. An off-tract improvement shall be required where either the existing
facilities serving the area or subarea are already operating at deficient
levels of service or the inclusion of new development will make such
present level of service deficient according to engineering standards
utilized in determining such levels of service.
D. The proportionate contribution of any such off-tract improvement to the
applicant shall be reasonably related to the relative benefit or use of the
total area so served.
E. Under the conditions of this chapter, off-tract improvements shall be
limited to new or improved water distribution, sanitary sewage disposal
and distribution and stormwater and drainage distribution facilities and
all necessary appurtenances thereto; to utility easements; and to new
or improved street and right-of-way widths, traffic regulation and
control devices, intersection improvements, utility relocation where not
provided elsewhere and other traffic, circulation and safety factors
which are directly related to the property or properties in question.
F. Off-tract improvements shall not include the improvement costs for an
entire utility system or street system or major segment thereof,
including sewage treatment plants or water supply or treatment
facilities or other similar undertakings, unless said improvement is
significantly affected by the property or properties in question.
A. That certain off-tract improvements are or are not necessary to
implement such subdivision or site plan.
B. That, in instances where off-tract improvements are required, the terms
and conditions which shall be imposed upon the applicant shall ensure
the successful and reasonable implementation of the same.
§ 173-61 (RESERVED) § 173-62
164:589
§ 173-63. Methods of implementation.
C. Regulations governing off-tract improvements shall be based upon
circulation and comprehensive utility plans pursuant to the adopted
Master Plan of the Closter Planning Board or the adopted utility or
circulation plans of the Borough of Closter or other governmental or
utility authority.
D. In the event that the approving authority determines that one or more
improvements constitute an off-tract improvement, the approving
authority, by resolution, shall notify the governing body of the same,
specifying the authority's recommendation relative to the estimated
cost of the same, the owner or developer's pro rata share of the cost and
possible methods or means to implement the same, including but not
limited to performance and maintenance guaranties, cash
contributions, development agreements and other forms of surety.
E. Where an applicant pays, under protest, the amount determined as the
pro rata share, he or she shall institute legal action within one year of
such payment in order to preserve the right to a judicial determination
as to the fairness and reasonableness of such amount.
F. The approving authority shall not take any final action on a preliminary
subdivision or site plan until all aspects of such conditions have been
mutually agreed to by both the applicant and the governing body and a
written resolution to that effect by the governing body has been
transmitted to the approving authority.
A. Performance and maintenance guaranties. Where a performance or
maintenance guaranty or other surety is required in connection with an
off-tract improvement, the applicant shall be required to follow the
same procedure and requirements as specified in Article XI.
B. Development agreement. Where a development agreement is required,
governing off-tract improvements or other conditions as may be
required by this chapter or by the approving authority, said agreement
shall be in accordance with §§ 173-20E and 173-30E. Said agreement
may specify the amount of cash contributions, if any, the method of
payment and the obligation or obligations to be undertaken by the
borough.
C. Cash contributions; when not required. Cash contributions for off-tract
improvements shall not be required under the following terms or
conditions:
(1) Where other county or state agencies or utility authorities have
jurisdiction over the subject improvement and require a cash
contribution, guaranty or other surety of the applicant in lieu of
such conditions imposed by the Borough of Closter.
§ 173-62 CLOSTER CODE § 173-63
164:590
§ 173-64. Pro rata formula in determining applicant's share of
improvements.
Where a cash contribution or other financial distribution is determined, the
following criteria shall be utilized in determining the proportionate share of
such improvement to the applicant.
(2) Where a benefit assessment or other similar tax levy is imposed
upon the applicant and other landowners similarly situated within a
designated service area for the off-tract improvements provided.
(3) Where the applicant, where legally permissive, can undertake the
improvements in lieu of the municipality, subject to standards and
other conditions as may be imposed by the Borough of Closter.
(4) Where the proportionate increase to the present system constitutes
less than 5% of the system's or systems' capabilities.
D. Cash contribution; method of payment.
(1) Where a cash contribution is required, said contribution will be
deposited with the Treasurer of Closter Borough, with transmittal
letters forwarded to the governing body, the Borough Engineer and
the approving authority.
(2) Any and all moneys received by the Treasurer shall be deposited in
an escrow account for the purpose of undertaking the
improvements specified. Where such improvements are not
undertaken or initiated for a period of 10 years, the funds shall be
returned to the owner of record of said properties, provided that
the conditions specified in § 173-63C have not been imposed.
Where such condition does exist, funds held in escrow will be
returned as soon as practical to the owner of record of said
properties.
A. Street widening, alignment, corrections, channelization of
intersections, construction of barriers, new or improved traffic
signalization, signs, curbs, sidewalks, trees, utility improvements not
covered elsewhere, the construction of new streets and other similar
street or traffic improvements. The applicant's proportionate cost shall
be in the ratio of the estimated peak-hour traffic generated by the
proposed property or properties to the sum of the present deficiency in
peak-hour traffic capacity of the present facility and the estimated
peak-hour traffic generated by the proposed development. The ratio
thus calculated shall be increased by 10% for contingencies.
B. Water distribution facilities, including the installation of new water
mains, the extension of existing water mains, the relocation of such
facilities and the installation of other appurtenances associated
therewith. The applicant's proportionate cost shall be in the ratio of the
estimated daily use of water from the property or properties, measured
in gallons per day, for the existing system or subsystem and the
§ 173-63 (RESERVED) § 173-64
164:591
estimated daily use of water for the proposed development. The ratio
thus calculated shall be increased by 10% for contingencies.
C. Sanitary sewage distribution facilities, including the installation,
relocation or replacement of collector and interceptor sewers and the
installation, relocation or replacement of other appurtenances
associated therewith. The applicant's proportionate cost shall be in the
ratio of the estimated daily flow, measured in gallons, to the sum of the
present deficient capacity for the existing system or subsystem and the
estimated daily flow from the proposed project or development. In the
case where the peak flow from the proposed development may occur
during the peak flow period for the existing system, the ratio shall be
the estimated peak flow rate from the proposed development, measured
in gallons per minute, to the sum of the present peak flow deficiency in
the existing system or subsystem and the estimated peak flow rate from
the proposed development. The greater of the two ratios thus
calculated shall be increased by 10% for contingencies and shall be the
ratio used to determine the cost to the applicant.
D. Stormwater and drainage improvements, including the installation,
relocation or replacement of transmission lines, culverts and catch
basins and the installation, relocation or replacement of other
appurtenances associated therewith. The applicant's proportionate cost
shall be in the ratio of the estimated peak surface runoff as proposed to
be delivered into the existing system, measured in cubic feet per
second, to the sum of the existing peak-hour flow, measured in cubic
feet per second, deficient for the existing system and the estimated
peak flow as proposed to be delivered. The ratio thus calculated shall be
increased by 10% for contingencies.

ARTICLE XIII
Open Space, Public Areas, Farmland Assessment Areas Subject to
Subdivision and Site Plan Approval and Planned Developments
§ 173-65. Standards for the establishment of open space
organizations.
A. Under the provisions of this chapter and state statutes, the Borough of
Closter, other governmental agencies, the Board of Education and
state, county and other public bodies can be designated to maintain and
accept public open space for recreational or conservational uses. These
public agencies can accept and maintain such open spaces, provided
that the dedication is not conditioned upon the same being made
available to public use.
B. Where a subdivision or site plan is required, this chapter shall require
that the applicant provide for an organization for the ownership and
maintenance of any open space for the benefit of owners or residents of
the development, if said open space is not dedicated to the municipality
or other governmental agency. Such organizations shall not be
dissolved and shall not dispose of any open space, by sale or otherwise,
except to an organization conceived and established to own and
maintain the open space for the benefit of such development, and
thereafter such organization shall not be dissolved or dispose of any of
its open space without first offering to dedicate the same to Closter
Borough wherein the land is located.
C. In the event that such organization shall fail to maintain the open space
in reasonable order and condition, the administrative officer designated
by resolution to administer this section may serve written notice upon
the owners of the development setting forth the manner in which the
organization has failed to maintain the open space in reasonable
condition, and said notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies
of maintenance be cured within 35 days thereof and shall state the date
and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held within 15 days of the
notice. At such hearing, the designated municipal body or
administrative officer may modify the terms of the original notice as to
deficiencies and may give a reasonable extension of time, not to exceed
65 days, within which they may be cured. If the deficiencies set forth in
the original notice or in the modification thereof shall not be cured
within said 35 days or any permitted extension thereof, the borough, in
order to preserve the open space and maintain the same for a period of
one year, may enter upon and maintain such land. Said entry and
maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the open
space except when the same is voluntarily dedicated to the public by
the owners. Before the expiration of said year, the designated borough
body or officer, as the case may be, shall, upon its own initiative or upon
the request of the organization theretofore responsible for the
maintenance of the open space, call a public hearing upon 15 days'
written notice to such organization and to the owners of the
§ 173-65 (RESERVED) § 173-65
164:593
§ 173-66. Reservation of public areas.
development, to be held by such borough body or officer, at which
hearing such organization and the owners of the development shall
show cause why such maintenance by the borough shall not, at the
election of the borough, continue for a succeeding year. If the
designated borough body or officer shall determine that such
organization is ready and able to maintain said open space in a
reasonable condition, the borough shall cease to maintain said open
space at the end of said year. If the borough body or officer shall
determine that such organization is not ready and able to maintain said
open space in a reasonable condition, the borough may, in its discretion,
continue to maintain said open space during the next succeeding year,
subject to a similar hearing and determination in each year thereafter.
The decision of the borough body or officer in any such case shall
constitute a final administrative decision, subject to judicial review.
D. If a municipal body or officer is not designated by resolution to
administer this section, the governing body shall have the same powers
and be subject to the same restrictions as provided in this section.
E. The cost of such maintenance by the borough shall be assessed pro rata
against the properties within the development that have a right of
enjoyment of the open space in accordance with assessed value at the
time of the imposition of the lien and shall become a lien and tax on said
properties and be added to and be a part of the taxes to be levied and
assessed thereon and enforced and collected with interest by the same
officers and in the same manner as other taxes.
A. Where applicable.
(1) If the Master Plan of the Borough of Closter or the Official Map of
the Borough of Closter provides for the reservation of designated
streets, public drainageways, flood control basins or public areas
within the proposed development, before approving a subdivision
or site plan, the approving authority may further require that such
streets, ways, basins or areas be shown on the plat in locations and
sizes suitable to their intended uses. The approving authority may
reserve the location and extent of such streets, ways, basins or
areas shown on the plat for a period of one year after the approval
of the final plat or within such further time as may be agreed to by
the developer.
(2) Unless during such a period or extension thereof the government
entity having jurisdiction shall have entered into a contract to
purchase or institute condemnation proceedings according to law
for the fee or a lesser interest in the land comprising such streets,
ways, basins or areas, the applicant shall not be bound by such
reservations shown on the plat and may proceed to use such land
for private use in accordance with applicable development
regulations. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the
§ 173-65 CLOSTER CODE § 173-66
164:594
§ 173-67. Valuation, assessment and taxation of farmland.
streets and roadways, flood control basins or public drainageways
necessitated by the subdivision or land development and required
for final approval.
B. Compensation to applicant. The applicant shall be entitled to just
compensation for actual loss found to be caused by such temporary
reservation and deprivation of use. In such instances, unless a lesser
amount has previously been mutually agreed upon, just compensation
shall be deemed to be the fair market value of an option to purchase the
land reserved for the period of reservation, provided that determination
of such fair market value shall include but not be limited to
consideration of real property taxes apportioned to the land reserved
and prorated for the period of reservation. The applicant shall be
compensated for the reasonable increased cost of legal, engineering or
other professional services incurred in connection with obtaining
subdivision or site plan approval caused by the reservation.
A. Any parcel of land receiving preliminary subdivision, site plan or
planned development approval for a use other than agricultural or
horticulture, notwithstanding its valuation, assessment and taxation as
an agricultural or horticultural use pursuant to the provisions of the
Farmland Assessment Act of 1964, P.L. 1964, c. 48 (N.J.S.A. 54:4-23.1 et
seq.), shall be valued, assessed and taxed as of January 1 of the year
following such preliminary approval as other land in the taxing district,
such value and assessment to be established and taxes paid in
accordance with the provisions of Sections 8 and 9 of the Farmland
Assessment Act of 1964, P.L. 1964, c. 48 (N.J.S.A. 54:4-23.1 et seq.),
provided that the provisions hereof shall apply serially to any
development whose preliminary approval proposes construction in
stages and separate application for final approval for each stage and
only that stage of the development designated for the earliest
application for final approval shall be valued, assessed and taxed as
provided herein until certificates of occupancy for 50% of the building
permits in such stage have been issued, at which time the second stage
shall be valued, assessed and taxed as provided herein, and so on until
qualification for valuation, assessment and taxation pursuant to the
provisions of the Farmland Assessment Act of 1964, P.L. 1964, c. 48
(N.J.S.A. 54:4-23.1 et seq.) lapse for the last stage of such development.
B. Any parcel of land otherwise qualifying as an agricultural or
horticultural use pursuant to the provisions of the Farmland
Assessment Act of 1964, P.L. 1964, c. 48 (N.J.S.A. 54:4-23.1 et seq.), for
which preliminary approval shall have lapsed pursuant to law or for
which the owner thereof shall have made a request, in writing, to the
governing body for rescinding such preliminary and all subsequent
approvals, shall be assessed, valued and taxed in the manner provided
in the Farmland Assessment Act of 1964, P.L. 1964, c. 48 (N.J.S.A.
§ 173-66 (RESERVED) § 173-67
164:595
54:4-23.1 et seq.), as of January 1 of the year following such lapse or
rescission.
C. Any parcel of land to which the provisions of Subsection A hereof are
applicable but which cannot be developed because of the lack of
available sanitary sewage or water supply capacity necessary to serve
such development shall be exempt from the operation of the provisions
of Subsection A herein for the period from January 1 of the year
following the calendar year in which such development becomes
impracticable because of such lack of capacity to January 1 of the year
following the calendar year in which such capacity becomes available.
D. The provisions of this section shall apply to any parcel of land
designated as an agricultural or horticultural use, pursuant to the
provisions of the Farmland Assessment Act of 1964, P.L. 1964, c. 48
(N.J.S.A. 54:4-23.1 et seq.), which has tentative or subsequent planned
development approval or site plan approval on the effective date of this
chapter.

The Borough Council of the Borough of Closter finds that the preservation,
protection and planting of trees aid in the stabilization of soil by the
prevention of erosion and sedimentation; reduce stormwater runoff and the
potential damage it may create; aid in the removal of pollutants from the air
and assist in the generation of oxygen; provide a buffer and screen against
noise and pollution; help to decrease the amount and rate of stormwater
runoff and to replenish groundwater supplies; act to moderate extremes
of temperature and to provide shade; aid in the control of drainage and
restoration of denuded soil subsequent to construction or grading; provide a
haven for birds and other wildlife and otherwise enhance the environment;
protect and increase property values; conserve and enhance the Borough's
physical and aesthetic appearance; and generally protect the public health
and safety as well as the general welfare. Therefore, it is the intent of the
Borough of Closter to maintain as much tree cover as possible through this
chapter. Moreover, the Borough intends through the implementation of this
chapter to achieve an outcome that balances the protection of trees with
respect for individual property rights.

Zoning Ordinance182 or any other municipal, state, or federal statute,
ordinance or regulation.
C. Hardship appeal. In the event that an applicant believes the standards
set forth in Subsections A and B above constitute a hardship which
prohibits a reasonable use of all or substantially all of the property in
question, an applicant may seek relief from the Mayor and Borough
Council. In the event that such relief is sought, the applicant shall
submit a letter to the Mayor and Council stating the factual basis and
reasons for the appeal. The Mayor and Borough Council, upon
submission of the letter to the Borough Clerk, shall schedule a public
hearing in connection with the requested relief. At the hearing, the
applicant may present witnesses under oath, and any other interested
parties may do the same. All witnesses shall be subject to crossexamination.
The decision of the Mayor and Borough Council shall be
binding upon the municipal official in charge of enforcement and
administration of this section.
D. Mitigation. The Code Enforcement Official - Trees shall determine and
approve the mitigation plan. Mitigation for tree removal shall be
required as follows: [Amended 6-22-2011 by Ord. No. 2011:1094]
(1) Mitigation shall consist of planting trees with a minimum caliper
(DBH) of 2 1/2 inches or a sum of money equal to the approximate
cost of such planting [see § 181-6D(4)(c)] or a combination of both.
Mitigation shall be decided upon prior to removal of any trees, and
the trees proposed to be planted are to be done in consultation with
the Borough's Code Enforcement Official - Trees. In reviewing the
mitigation plans submitted by the applicant, the Code Enforcement
Official - Trees is to approve trees that will be allowed to grow to
their natural height at maturity rather than being kept artificially
small.
(2) Mitigation shall be required in the event of tree removal pursuant
to § 181-6A(3), (5), (6) and (7).
(3) In the event of tree removal pursuant to § 181-6A(4), no mitigation
shall be required if the tree has been planted for a least five years;
there has been no damage to the tree by construction or otherwise
by any person; and there has been no soil moving within 15 feet of
such tree within five years; otherwise, mitigation shall be required
pursuant to § 181-6D.
(4) For each tree for which mitigation is required, the following shall
apply:
(a) For each tree removed pursuant to the standards of this
section, the applicant shall plant on the property in question:

NOTE:
* No mitigation is required for the first two trees; limit: two
trees in a twenty-four-month period. The twenty-four-month
time period begins from the date the tree removal permit is
issued.
(b) The caliper of trees with multiple trunks shall be calculated by
multiplying the caliper of the larger trunk by 1.5 times.
(c) In the event the applicant asserts the planting of trees on the
property in question would be inappropriate and the official in
charge of enforcement and administration of this section
agrees, the applicant may, in lieu of planting trees, provide to
the municipality a sum of money equal to the approximate cost
of such tree planting. The total amount shall be determined by
the Code Enforcement Official - Trees, based on the market
value and planting costs of the trees to be planted. Funds
collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the
Borough's Shade Tree Fund for use by the Borough's Shade
Tree Commission to plant and maintain trees elsewhere in the
Borough.
(5) In the event that tree removal occurs in an area other than
permitted in Subsection A this section, mitigation shall be required
at a rate two times the number of trees required pursuant to
Subsection D(4)(a) hereinabove.
(6) In the event that it is unknown how many trees were removed from
any given site and removal took place without a tree removal
permit issued pursuant to this chapter, the number of trees
requiring mitigation shall be computed by assuming trees over six
inches in caliper existed 30 feet on center and plotting the
maximum number of those trees as circles of a fifteen-foot radius
without having the circles overlap or extend beyond the property
lines or driplines of existing trees.
(7) In connection with tree removal pursuant to Subsection A(3) of this
section, it shall be required that the applicant plant trees on center
a minimum distance of 30 feet as street trees between the curbline
§ 181-6 TRAILERS AND CAMP CARS § 181-6
180:645
§ 181-7. Protection of existing trees.
and the edge of the right-of-way in a location determined by the
municipal official administering this section or beyond if agreed to
by the homeowner.
(8) Mitigation in any instance is not to be considered a penalty, rather
an implementation of the purposes of this section. Mitigation shall
not be a substitute for, but shall be in addition to, any penalty
imposed for violation of the provisions of this section.
(9) Upon the approval of the Mayor and Council, the mitigation
requirements pursuant to this paragraph may be satisfied by the
applicant by donating the tree to be removed to the Borough of
Closter to be planted elsewhere in the Borough of Closter at the
expense of the applicant. The qualified tree specialist shall inspect
any such trees and submit a recommendation to the Mayor and
Council as to whether to accept such donation.
A. In connection with any construction, subsequent to tree clearing but
prior to the issuance of a building permit or start of construction, snow
fencing, or other protective barrier acceptable to the municipal official
charged with the enforcement and administration of this section, shall
be placed around trees that are not to be removed. The protection
barriers shall be placed at a distance of at least 10 feet from the trunk
of any tree or the tree dripline, whichever distance shall be greater, and
shall remain in place until all construction activity on the property has
terminated. No equipment, chemicals, soil deposits or construction
materials shall be placed within any area so protected by barriers. Any
landscaping activities subsequent to the removal of the barriers shall be
accomplished with light machinery or hand labor.
B. No person shall:
(1) Cut down or remove any tree except as permitted by this chapter or
allow or cause such cutting or removal.
(2) Cause or allow any willful damage, injury or disfigurement of any
tree growing within the property in question. For purposes of this
chapter, the actions of any person shall be deemed willful if the
damage, injury or disfigurement of any tree is caused as the result,
but not limited to the following: cutting, gashing or slitting on any
tree; the pouring of any liquid or other material on any tree or on
the nearby ground; the construction or placement of any nonporous
material on the ground around any tree so as to cut off air, light or
water from the roots; or placement or removal of any soil within 10
feet of any tree.
(3) Store or pile building materials or debris or place construction
equipment within 10 feet of any tree or within the protected zone
10 feet beyond the dripline, whichever is greater. The Code

C. In the event that any tree to be saved in connection with construction as
set forth above or any tree planted in mitigation shall die within two
years after planting, it shall be replaced by the applicant or the
property owners within six months.
A. As a precondition to the issuance of a permit where mitigation is
required, the applicant shall post a cash bond with the Borough
Treasurer to assure mitigation in an amount equal to the amount
determined by the Code Enforcement Official - Trees as set forth in
§ 181-6D(4) for each tree to be planted. At the end of the third fiscal
year following the fiscal year in which the bond was posted and upon
the satisfactory completion of the required mitigation, the Borough
shall return the cash bond to the applicant. The cash bond shall be
retained by the Borough for this period to assure survival of the tree or
trees planted by the applicant in satisfaction of the mitigation
requirements. Said bond shall be returned upon the recommendation of
the Code Enforcement Official - Trees and the approval of the Mayor
and Council.
B. The applicant shall contact the Code Enforcement Official - Trees within
seven business days of the completion of the planting of the trees
required for mitigation to schedule a date and time for an inspection in
order for the Borough to determine whether the required mitigation has
been completed satisfactorily.
C. Notwithstanding the above, the applicant and/or property owner shall
forfeit the cash bond amount if the applicant and/or property owner
fails to complete the planting of the trees within the time of completion
set forth in § 181-8. Prior to the forfeiture of any cash bond monies, the
Code Enforcement Official - Trees shall cause a written notice to be
served upon the applicant and/or property owner who posted the cash
bond. Service of the notice shall be made in person or by certified mail,
return receipt requested. Upon service of any notice pursuant to this
subsection, the applicant and/or property owner shall have 10 days, or
such further time as the Mayor and Council shall agree, in writing, to
plant the trees that have not been planted, or the applicant and/or
property owner shall forfeit any cash bond amounts posted by the
applicant and/or property owner. Any monies forfeited by the applicant
and/or property owner shall be deposited in the Borough's Shade Tree

The tree(s) required to be planted by the applicant and/or property owner
pursuant to Section § 181-6D(4) shall be planted within six months after
the completion of the project for which the permit was issued, the issuance
of a certificate of occupancy, or the issuance of a certificate of approval,
whichever shall be sooner. The applicant may submit a written request to
the Construction Office for an extension of time of up to 60 days. Additional
extensions may be granted, upon the written request of the applicant, at
the discretion of the Construction Office. Extension requests shall not be
unreasonably denied. However, in no event shall the time for completion be
extended beyond a total of six additional months.

D. As an additional precondition to the issuance of a permit, the applicant
shall post a cash bond in the equivalent of $1,500 for each street tree
present on the property that is not otherwise covered by mitigation. At
the end of the third calendar year from the date of the issuance of the
final certificate of occupancy (i.e., the bond can be held for up to two
years and 11 months) and upon certification by the Code Enforcement
Official - Trees that the trees continue to be in good health, the Borough
shall return the cash bond to the applicant. The cash bond shall be
retained by the Borough for this period to assure the survival of the
tree(s) and recover the cost of removal and replacement of the trees for
taxpayers should the tree(s) not survive.
A. Upon the written recommendation of the Environmental Commission
and with the written approval of the property owner, the Mayor and
Council of the Borough of Closter shall determine whether any tree
qualifies as a landmark tree. A tree may qualify as a landmark tree if it
meets one or more of the following criteria:

B. In addition to the penalties outlined in the above subsection, the
Borough may require a person who removes or otherwise destroys a
tree in violation of this chapter to pay a replacement assessment to the
municipality. The replacement assessment shall be the value of the tree

Ord. No. 2018:1249]
§ 200-54.1. Purpose.
The purpose of the Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) District is to provide
realistic opportunities to capture affordable housing in an effort to meet
the Borough of Closter's unmet need obligation. The Affordable Housing
Overlay District (AHO) creates a realistic opportunity for housing with an
affordable component in the Borough's Commercial (District No. 4) and
Industrial (District No. 5) areas.
§ 200-54.2. Uses.
In addition to those uses permitted in the underlying districts (i.e.
Commercial or Industrial) the following inclusionary housing options are
permitted conditional uses in the Affordable Housing Overlay District,
subject to the conditional use standards contained in § 200-54.3. Site plan
and conditional use approvals are required.
§ 200-54.3. Conditions.
A. Owner-occupied townhouses at a maximum density of eight units per
acre, with a 20% affordable set-aside.

for all properties in the Affordable Housing Overlay, except for the
Reuten Drive Industrial Zone District, which is identified on the Zoning
Map as "Affordable Housing District Overlay Reuten." Affordable
Housing District Overlay Reuten apartment density is 10 units per acre.
All other conditions, bulk regulations, other regulations, and
affordability requirements as contained herein are the same for the
Affordable Housing Overlay Districts and the Affordable Housing
Overlay Reuten District.

low- and moderate-income households. In the event that the 20% of the
total number of residential units does not result in a complete integer,
the fraction number of units shall be rounded upward to provide one
additional whole unit. For example, if a development includes 16 units,
the 20% set-aside equals an affordable obligation of 3.2 units. The
fractional unit is rounded up to the next integer; therefore, the
development would include four affordable units.

District No. 3A, Business Area
[Added 12-20-2018 by Ord. No. 2018:1247]
§ 200-54.7. Permitted uses.
In District Number 3A, Business Area 3A, no building or premises shall be
used and no building or part of a building shall be erected, constructed or
altered which shall be arranged, intended or designed to be used for any
purpose other than the uses permitted in District No. 3, Business Area, as
contained in § 200-11 of the Code of the Borough of Closter.
§ 200-54.8. Conditional uses.
A. In District Number 3A, Business Area 3A, a mix of business/commercial
and housing uses will be a permitted conditional use in the zone
district. Such mixed-use developments would require site plan and
conditional use approvals. The residential component of the mixed use
will include an affordable component in an effort to meet the Borough's
unmet need obligation. If the residential units are rental units, 15% of
the units shall be reserved for affordable households. If the units are
for-sale, 20% of the units shall be reserved for affordable units.
B. The mixed use shall be subject to the following conditions:
(1) The ground floor use shall be a business or commercial use that is
permitted in Business District Number 3A, as provided in § 200-11.
(2) The second and third floors use shall be residential apartments.
(3) Maximum residential density of 10 units per acre.
(4) The bulk regulations for the Business District Number 3, as
contained in Schedule A of the Borough Zoning Ordinance, shall be
met, with the exception of minimum lot area and maximum
permitted building height (feet and stories), which shall be
governed by Subsection B(5) and (6) herein.
(5) Minimum lot area: one acre.
(6) Maximum permitted building height (feet): 34 feet.
(7) Maximum permitted building height (stories): three stories.
(8) All parking requirements shall conform to Chapter 173 of the Code
of the Borough of Closter, as well as the New Jersey Residential Site
Improvement Standards.
(9) If the residential units are rental units, 15% shall be reserved for
affordable households. If the units are for-sale, 20% shall be
reserved for affordable units. In the event that the 15% or 20% of
the total number of residential units does not result in a complete
integer, the fraction number of units shall be rounded upward to
§ 200-54.7 WATER § 200-54.8
189:775
§ 200-54.9. Design standards.
§ 200-54.10. Affordability.
provide one additional whole unit. For example, if a mixed-use
development includes 16 units, the 20% set-aside equals an
affordable obligation of 3.2 units. The fractional unit is rounded up
to the next integer; therefore, the development would include four
affordable units.
A. Dwelling units shall have a compatible architectural theme, with
complementary variations in exterior design and color. This shall
include varying building and/or facade orientation, modifying dwelling
unit widths and heights, changing rooflines and altering color and
fenestration patterns. All sides of a building facing a public street shall
be architecturally designed to be consistent with regard to style,
materials, colors and details.
B. The facades of apartment units in a group shall be varied by changed
front yard setbacks and variation in materials or design so that not
more than two abutting apartments will have the same front yard
setback and the same or essentially the same architectural treatment of
facades and roof lines. Mansard roofs, defined as a roof that has four
sloping sides, each of which becomes steeper halfway down are
encouraged.
C. All building entrances shall include architectural elements, including
but not limited to columns, porches, overhangs, etc.
D. It is the goal of this article to generate appropriately scaled
development, promote buildings with architectural distinction and
encourage environmental sustainability. Variations in design as well as
establishing patterns of building widths and lots are encouraged. For
the nonresidential component of the mixed use, conformity among
signage and awnings is encouraged.
E. All rooftop mechanical equipment shall be located in the rear third of
the roof area, except for corner lots in which case the mechanical
equipment shall be located on the rear half of the roof area. This
requirement shall be subject to the review of the Planning Board and
the Borough Engineer as part of the site plan review process.
F. Mixed-use sites shall be designed to maximize available light, air and
open space.
A. All affordable housing units shall be subject to the all applicable
municipal and New Jersey State review processes and approvals and
the Borough's June 2018 settlement agreement.
B. All affordable units shall be subject to all the provisions of the Uniform
Housing Affordability Controls (U.H.A.C.), including but not limited to,
bedroom distribution, ownership and rental, unit administration.
§ 200-54.8 CLOSTER CODE § 200-54.10
189:776
C. The fair share obligation shall be divided equally between low- and
moderate-income units, except that where there is an odd number of
affordable housing units, the extra unit shall be a low-income unit.
D. In each affordable development, at least 50% of the restricted units
within each bedroom distribution shall be low-income units.
E. Within mixed-use developments, of the total number of affordable
rental units, at least 13% shall be affordable to very-low-income
households.
F. The affordable units shall comply with the Borough's Affordable
Housing Ordinance contained in Article XID.

units (affordable to a household earning 30% or less of
regional median income by household size). The very-low-income
units shall be counted as part of the required number of low-income
units within the development.
(2) In each affordable development, at least 50% of the restricted units
within each bedroom distribution shall be very-low or low-income
units.
(3) Affordable developments that are not age-restricted shall be
structured in conjunction with realistic market demands such that:
(a) The combined number of efficiency and one-bedroom units
shall be no greater than 20% of the total low- and moderateincome
units;
(b) At least 30% of all low- and moderate-income units shall be
two-bedroom units;
(c) At least 20% of all low- and moderate-income units shall be
three-bedroom units; and
(d) The remaining units may be allocated among two- and threebedroom
units at the discretion of the developer.
(4) Affordable developments that are age-restricted shall be structured
such that the number of bedrooms shall equal the number of agerestricted
low- and moderate-income units within the inclusionary
development. This standard may be met by having all one-bedroom
units or by having a two-bedroom unit for each efficiency unit.
B. Accessibility requirements:
(1) The first floor of all restricted townhouse dwelling units and all
restricted units in all other multistory buildings shall be subject to
the technical design standards of the Barrier Free SubCode,
N.J.A.C. 5:23-7 and the following:

other multistory buildings in which a restricted dwelling unit is
attached to at least one other dwelling unit shall have the following
features:
(a) An adaptable kitchen on the first floor; and
(b) An adaptable toilet and bathing facility on the first floor; and
(c) An interior accessible route of travel on the first floor; and
(d) An adaptable room that can be used as a bedroom, with a door
or the casing for the installation of a door, on the first floor;
and
(e) If all of the foregoing requirements in Subsection B(2)(a)
through (d) cannot be satisfied, then an interior accessible
route of travel must be provided between stories within an
individual unit, but if all of the terms of Subsection B(2)(a)
through (d) above have been satisfied, then an interior
accessible route of travel shall not be required between stories
within an individual unit; and
(f) An accessible entranceway as set forth at P.L. 2005, c. 350
(N.J.S.A. 52:27D-311a, et seq.) and the Barrier Free SubCode,
N.J.A.C. 5:23-7, or evidence that Closter has collected funds
from the developer sufficient to make 10% of the adaptable
entrances in the development accessible:
[1] Where a unit has been constructed with an adaptable
entrance, upon the request of a disabled individual who is
either purchasing or will reside in the dwelling unit, an
accessible entrance shall be installed.
[2] To this end, the builder of restricted units shall deposit
funds within the Borough of Closter's Affordable Housing
Trust Fund sufficient to install accessible entrances in 10%
of the affordable units that have been constructed with
adaptable entrances.
[3] The funds deposited under Subsection B(2)(f)[2] above
shall be used by the Borough of Closter for the sole
purpose of making the adaptable entrance of an affordable

plan and cost estimate to the Construction Official of the
Borough of Closter for the conversion of adaptable to
accessible entrances.

189:786
[5] Once the Construction Official has determined that the
design plan to convert the unit entrances from adaptable
to accessible meet the requirements of the Barrier Free
SubCode, N.J.A.C. 5:23-7, and that the cost estimate of
such conversion is reasonable, payment shall be made to
the Borough's Affordable Housing Trust Fund in care of
the Borough Treasurer who shall ensure that the funds are
deposited into the Affordable Housing Trust Fund and
appropriately earmarked.
[6] Full compliance with the foregoing provisions shall not be
required where an entity can demonstrate that it is site
impracticable to meet the requirements. Determinations of

transfer of funds for the purpose of selling and receiving property has
taken place at the time of or as a condition of resale.

payment into the Borough of Closter Affordable Housing Trust
Fund of the gross amount of rent illegally collected;
(b) In the-case of an owner who has rented a low- or moderateincome
unit in violation of the regulations governing affordable
housing units, payment of an innocent tenant's reasonable
relocation costs, as determined by the Court.
(2) The municipality may file a court action in the Superior Court
seeking a judgment that would result in the termination of the
owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a
mortgage foreclosure. Any such judgment shall be enforceable as if
the same were a judgment of default of the First Purchase Money
Mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the low- or moderateincome
unit.
(a) The judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the
municipality, by means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at
which time the low- and moderate-income unit of the violating
owner shall be sold at a sale price which is not less than the
amount necessary to fully satisfy and pay off any First
Purchase Money Mortgage and prior liens and the costs of the
§ 200-54.32 CLOSTER CODE § 200-54.32
189:800
enforcement proceedings incurred by the municipality,
including attorney's fees. The violating owner shall have his
right to possession terminated as well as his title conveyed
pursuant to the Sheriffs sale.
(b) The proceeds of the Sheriffs sale shall first be applied to satisfy
the First Purchase Money Mortgage lien and any prior liens
upon the low- and moderate-income unit. The excess, if any,
shall be applied to reimburse the municipality for any and all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with either the
court action resulting in the judgment of violation or the
Sheriffs sale. In the event that the proceeds from the Sheriffs
sale are insufficient to reimburse the municipality in full as
aforesaid, the violating owner shall be personally responsible
for the full extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and all
costs incurred by the municipality in connection with collecting
such deficiency. In the event that a surplus remains after
satisfying all of the above, such surplus, if any, shall be placed
in escrow by the municipality for the owner and shall be held in
such escrow for a maximum period of two years or until such
earlier time as the owner shall make a claim with the
municipality for such. Failure of the owner to claim such
balance within the two-year period shall automatically result in
a forfeiture of such balance to the municipality. Any interest
accrued or earned on such balance while being held in escrow
shall belong to and shall be paid to the municipality, whether
such balance shall be paid to the owner or forfeited to the
municipality.
(c) Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the
regulations governing affordable housing units shall not
extinguish the restrictions of the regulations governing
affordable housing units as the same apply to the low- and
moderate-income unit. Title shall be conveyed to the purchaser
at the Sheriffs sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions of
the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. The
owner determined to be in violation of the provisions of this
plan and from whom title and possession were taken by means
of the Sheriffs sale shall not be entitled to any right of
redemption.
(d) If there are no bidders at the Sheriffs sale, or if insufficient
amounts are bid to satisfy the First Purchase Money Mortgage
and any prior liens, the municipality may acquire title to the
low- and moderate-income unit by satisfying the First Purchase
Money Mortgage and any prior liens and crediting the violating
owner with an amount equal to the difference between the
First Purchase Money Mortgage and any prior liens and costs
of the enforcement proceedings, including legal fees and the
maximum resale price-for which the low-and moderate-income
§ 200-54.32 WATER § 200-54.32
189:801
§ 200-54.33. Affirmative marketing.
unit could have been sold under the terms of the regulations
governing affordable housing units. This excess shall be
treated in the same manner as the excess which would have
been realized from an actual sale as previously described.
(e) Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold
at the Sheriffs sale or acquired by the municipality shall
obligate the owner to accept an offer to purchase from any
qualified purchaser which may be referred to the owner by the
municipality, with such offer to purchase being equal to the
maximum resale price of the low- and moderate-income unit as
permitted by the regulations governing affordable housing
units.
(f) The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable
for complying with the terms and restrictions of governing
affordable housing units until such time as title is conveyed
from the owner.

be screened for preliminary income eligibility by comparing their
total income to the low- and moderate-income limits adopted by

restriction and shall execute a disclosure statement which briefly
summarizes the salient features of the use, occupancy and resale
restrictions applicable to the low- and moderate-income unit. It shall be
the developer's responsibility to provide such for the initial sales and
subsequent owner's responsibility to provide the same for resales. The

annuity programs, shall not be included in the current income until
such payments are being received. However, these assets must be
reported and verified.
G. Net rent from real estate is considered income after the monthly

I. Standard credit information services that provide conventional credit
and tenant reports may be utilized when certifying a household with
required written permission from the household. An unsatisfactory
credit history or credit information that demonstrates a
disproportionate debt-to-income ratio may result in a denial of
certification. Court-ordered payments for alimony or child support to
another household shall be considered a regular monthly debt whether
or not it is being paid regularly.

but below 80% of the authorized median income guideline shall be
certified as moderate-income households and referred to units
designated for moderate-income households.
L. Generally, households will be referred to units where predetermined
total monthly housing costs correspond to the household's calculated
ability to pay using 28% of gross monthly income as a standard for
home ownership and 30% of gross monthly income as standard for
rental units.
M. At the discretion of the administrative agency, households may also be

(3) Unrelated adults or persons of the opposite sex other than husband
and wife in separate bedrooms; and

189:809
one additional bedroom per household occupancy standard as stated in
Subsection N above.
P. A form for certification shall be prepared and signed by the
administrative agency. Only households receiving certification shall be
referred to affordable units.
Q. Certified household who reject an opportunity for affordable housing
may remain on the referral list at their request and may be
reinterviewed for certification when their name appears on a list for a
subsequent unit.
R. Certification shall be valid for no more than 120 days unless a valid
sales contract or lease has been executed within that time period. In
this event, certifications shall be valid until such time as the sales
contract or lease is ruled invalid and no occupancy has occurred.
Certifications may be renewed in writing at the request of a certified
household for no more than an additional period of 120 days at the
discretion of the administrative agency.
S. Households who are denied certification may make a written request
for redetermination. Households shall be required to produce
additional documentation to support their claim.

below:
ALTERNATIVE TOWER STRUCTURE  Man-made trees, clock towers, bell
towers, steeples, light poles and similar alternative-design mounting
structures that camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers.

impacts of towers and antennas.
(2) Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas.
(3) Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community.
(4) Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as
a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use
towers.
(5) Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal.
(6) Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and
antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening and
innovative camouflaging techniques.
(7) Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and
efficiently.
(8) Consider the public health and safety of communication towers.
(9) Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures.
B. In furtherance of these goals, the Borough of Closter shall give due
consideration to the Borough of Closter's Master Plan, Zoning Map,
existing land uses and environmentally sensitive areas in approving
sites for the location of towers and antennas.
§ 200-96 WATER § 200-97
189:847
ANTENNA  Any exterior transmitting or receiving device mounted on

antenna for which a building permit or conditional use permit has been
properly issued prior to the effective date of this article, including permitted
towers or antennas that have not yet been constructed so long as such
approval is current and not expired.
TOWER  Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for
the purpose of supporting one or more antennas for telephone, radio and
similar communication purposes, including self-supporting lattice towers,
guyed towers or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television
transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular
telephone towers, alternative tower structures and the like. The term
includes the structure and any support thereto.

D. Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following requirements:
(1) Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to
any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so
as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2) At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures
shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures,
screening and landscaping that will blend them into the natural
setting and surrounding buildings.
(3) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must
be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with,
the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and
related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
E. Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the
FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting
§ 200-98 WATER § 200-99
189:849
alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views.

and regulations within six months of the effective date of such
standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is
mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring
towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or
antenna at the owner's expense.
G. Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of
towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local
building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are
published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from
time to time. If, upon inspection, the Borough of Closter concludes that
a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a
danger to persons or property, then, upon notice being provided to the
owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower
into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into
compliance within said 30 days shall constitute grounds for the removal
of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense.
H. Measurement. For purposes of measurement, tower setbacks and
separation distances shall be calculated and applied to facilities located
in the Borough of Closter irrespective of municipal and county
jurisdictional boundaries.
I. Not essential services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this article and shall not be regulated or
permitted as essential services, public utilities or private utilities.

application for a conditional use approval to the Planning Board
pursuant to § 200-102 prior to filing any appeal that may be
available under this chapter.
B. List of administratively approved uses. The following uses may be
approved by the Site Plan Subcommittee of the Planning Board after
conducting an administrative review:
(1) Locating antennas on existing structures or towers consistent with
the terms of Subsections B(1)(a) and (b) below:
(a) Antennas on existing structures. Any antenna which is not
attached to a tower may be approved by the Site Plan
Subcommittee of the Planning Board as an accessory use to
any commercial, industrial, professional or institutional use,
provided that:
[1] The antenna as measured from the lowest grade does not
extend more than the maximum building height for the
zone wherein the structure is located.
[2] The antenna complies with all applicable FCC and FAA
regulations.
[3] The antenna complies with all applicable building codes.
(b) Antennas on existing towers. An antenna which is attached to
an existing tower may be approved by the Site Plan
Subcommittee of the Planning Board and, to minimize adverse
visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering
of towers, collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on
existing towers shall take precedence over the construction of
new towers, provided that such collocation is accomplished in
a manner consistent with the following:
[1] A tower which is modified or reconstructed to
accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna
shall be of the same tower type as the existing tower
unless the Site Plan Subcommittee of the Planning Board
allows reconstruction as a monopole.

height not to exceed the maximum tower height
established by this article
[b] The height change referred to in Subsection
B(1)(b)[2][a] may only occur one time per
communication tower.
[c] The additional height referred to in Subsection
B(1)(b)[2][a] shall not require an additional distance
separation as set forth in § 200-102. The tower's
premodification height shall be used to calculate such
distance separations.
[3] On-site location.
[a] A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the
collocation of an additional antenna may be moved onsite
within 50 feet of its existing location.
[b] After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation,
only one tower may remain on the site.
[c] A relocated on-site tower shall continue to be
measured from the original tower location for
purposes of calculating separation distances between
towers pursuant to § 200-102B(5). The relocation of a
tower hereunder shall in no way be deemed to cause a
violation of § 200-102B(5).
A. General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of
conditional use permits for towers or antennas by the Planning Board:
(1) If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under § 200-100 of
this article or permitted to be approved administratively pursuant
to § 200-101 of this article, then a conditional use permit shall be
required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an
antenna in all zoning districts.
(2) Applications for conditional use permits under this section shall be
subject to the procedures and requirements of Chapter 200,
Zoning, of the Closter Code, except as modified in this section.

(k) A description of the feasible location(s) of future towers or
antennas within the Borough of Closter based upon existing
physical, engineering, technological or geographical
limitations in the event that the proposed tower is erected.
(2) Factors considered in granting conditional use approvals for
towers. In addition to any standards for consideration of
conditional use approval applications pursuant to Chapter 200,
Zoning, of the Closter Code, the Planning Board shall consider the
following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use
approval, although the Planning Board may waive or reduce the
burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the
Planning Board concludes that the goals of this article are better
served thereby:
(a) Height of the proposed tower.
(b) Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries.
(c) Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties.
(d) Surrounding topography.
(e) Surrounding tree coverage and foliage.
(f) Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating
visual obtrusiveness.
(g) Proposed ingress and egress.
(h) Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or
structures as discussed in § 200-102B(3) of this article.
(3) Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless the
applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Planning Board that no existing tower, structure or alternative
§ 200-102 WATER § 200-102
189:855
technology that does not require the use of towers or structures
can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. An applicant
shall submit information requested by the Planning Board related
to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that
no existing tower, structure or alternative technology can
accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any
of the following (although nothing should be construed to infer that
meeting one, some or all of the following shall entitle the applicant
to approval):
(a) No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area which meet the applicant's engineering
requirements.
(b) Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
(c) Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and
related equipment.
(d) The applicant's proposed antenna would cause
electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing
towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or
structures would cause interference with the applicant's
proposed antenna.
(e) The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner
in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an
existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs
exceeding new tower development are presumed to be
unreasonable.
(f) The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
(g) The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a
cable microcell network using multiple low-powered
transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is
unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new
tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render
the technology unsuitable.
(4) Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all
towers for which a conditional use approval is required; provided,
however, that the Planning Board may reduce the standard setback
requirements if the goals of this article would be better served
thereby:
§ 200-102 CLOSTER CODE § 200-102
189:856
(a) Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least 75% of the
height of the tower from any adjoining lot line.
(b) Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning
district setback requirements.
(c) No tower shall exist within required buffer areas if adjacent to
residential zones and as prescribed under local ordinance.
(5) Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply to
all towers and antennas for which a conditional use approval is
required; provided, however, that the Planning Board may reduce
the standard separation requirements if the goals of this article
would be better served thereby:
(a) Separation from off-site uses/designated areas.
[1] Tower separation shall be measured from the base of the
tower to the lot line of the off-site uses and/or designated
areas as specified in Table 1, except as otherwise provided
in Table 1.
[2] Separation requirements for towers shall comply with the
minimum standards established in Table 1.

appropriate anticlimbing device.
(7) Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the
landscaping surrounding towers for which a conditional use
approval is required.
(a) Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screens the view of the tower
compound from property used for residences or planned
residences. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped
strip at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the
compound.
(b) In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be
minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced.
(c) Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some
cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural
growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer.

Tanning Booth Establishments
[Added 12-16-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-4]
§ 250-103. Title.
This article may be cited as the "Tanning Booth Ordinance of the Borough
of Closter."
§ 250-104. Findings; policy.
Whereas tanning booth establishments have enjoyed a recent, rapid growth
in popularity; and whereas the operation of tanning booths involves a
serious potential hazard to the public health, welfare and safety through the
exposure of persons to concentrations of ultraviolet light in excess of those
normally occurring in the environment; and whereas it has been established
that acute overexposure to the ultraviolet light emitted by tanning booth
lamps will cause skin burns and eye damage; and whereas it has been
established that chronic exposure to ultraviolet light can result in increased
incidences of skin cancer; now, therefore, it is the policy of the Board of
Health of Closter to protect the health, welfare, and safety of its citizens
from the potential hazards associated with the operation of tanning booth
establishments by the adoption of licensing procedures and standards to
govern such facilities.
§ 250-105. Definitions.
Wherever used in this article, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:
TANNING BOOTH  Any enclosed or semi-enclosed area or room,
containing one or more ultraviolet lamps, intended for irradiation of any
part of the human body to induce skin tanning.
TANNING BOOTH ESTABLISHMENT  Any commercial enterprise or
facility containing one or more tanning booths, provided that this definition
shall not include any hospital, clinic or other medical facility wherein
ultraviolet radiation is or may be used, under the supervision of a trained
medical staff, for the diagnosis or treatment of disease.
§ 250-106. License required; application.
A. No person shall at any time within the Borough of Closter conduct,
maintain or operate a tanning booth establishment without first having
obtained a license to do so from the Board of Health of the Borough of
Closter.
B. Application for such a license shall be made to the Board of Health, on
forms approved by it, signed and executed by the applicant.
§ 250-103 WATER § 250-107
189:947
§ 250-107. Conditions and requirements.
No license to conduct, maintain or operate a tanning booth establishment
shall be granted to any person until such person has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Board of Health that the following requirements have
been met.
A. Each tanning booth shall have, prominently displayed on its door or
beside its entrance, a sign that states: "Danger  Ultraviolet Radiation,
Follow Instructions. As with natural sunlight, overexposure can cause
injury and sunburn; repeated exposure may cause premature aging of
skin and skin cancer. Exposure of eyes to ultraviolet light without
protective eyewear may cause serious injury to eyes. Medications or
cosmetics applied to the skin may increase over sensitivity to ultraviolet
light, as may a family history of skin problems or allergy to sunlight.
Consult a physician before using this booth if you are taking any
medications or if you believe yourself sensitive to sunlight."
B. Each tanning booth shall be equipped with handrails, floor markings or
other suitable physical aids to assure that the user maintains the proper
exposure distance from the lamps.
C. Users shall, on each visit, be provided, free of charge, with sanitary
protective eyewear that protects the user's eyes from ultraviolet
radiation but permits sufficient vision to enable the user to maintain

Board.
C. In any subsequent municipal consent, the Borough shall require, at a
minimum, the same terms and conditions of any other provider of

authority as those contained in the instant consent. In the event such
subsequent consent does not contain the same terms and conditions as
the instant consent, the Borough agrees to support the company's
petition to the Board for modification of the consent in accordance with
N.J.S.A. 48:5A-47 and N.J.A.C. 14:17-6.7 to relieve the company of
competitive disadvantages identified in the company's petition.
A. Cablevision shall continue to make available noncommercial public,

application for municipal consent.
B. The Borough agrees that Cablevision shall retain the right to use the
PEG access channel, or portion thereof, for non-PEG access
programming during times when the Borough is not utilizing the

event that the company uses said PEG access channel for the
presentation of such other programming, the PEG programming shall
remain the priority use, and the company's rights with respect to using
the channel for non-PEG programming shall be subordinate to the
