EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

SECTION 1. INITIATIVE .

except an ordinance appropriating money or authorizing the levy of taxes, and
to adopt or reject the same at the polls, such power being known as the
initiative. An initiated ordinance or resolution shall be submitted to the
Council by a petition signed by at least ten percent (10%) in number of the
electors voting at the last regular municipal election. When so submitted, the
Clerk of the Council shall promptly determine the sufficiency of such petition
and if sufficient the Council shall take final action, either enacting or
rejecting the proposed ordinance or resolution within forty (40) days after
submission. If the Council fails to pass such proposed ordinance or resolution
or passes it in some form different from that set forth in the petition
therefor, the petitioners through the committee named on such petition may, by
the next regular meeting of the Council, request in writing that it be
submitted to a vote of the electors. Thereupon the Council shall provide for
submitting the initiated ordinance or resolution to the electors at the next
general or regular municipal election occurring more than ninety (90) days
after the filing of such petition, but if such petition is signed by at least
twenty percent (20%) in number of such electors, the date of the election may

than ninety (90) days after the filing of such petition.

Ohio, a petition signed by no less than ten percent (10%) in number of the
total electors voting at the last regular municipal election may be filed with
the Council, requesting the ordinance or resolution be repealed or submitted to
a vote of the electors. When such petition is filed the Clerk of the Council
shall promptly determine the sufficiency of the petition, and if found
sufficient, the Council shall thereupon, within thirty (30) days of the filing
of such petition reconsider such ordinance or resolution. If the Council fails
to repeal said ordinance or resolution within thirty (30) days of the filing of
such petition the Council shall submit it to a vote of the electors at the next
general or regular municipal election occurring more than ninety (90) days
after the filing of such petition, but if such petition is signed by at least
twenty percent (20%) in number of such electors, the date of the election may
be fixed therein, which may be a special election to be held at any time more
than ninety (90) days after the filing of such petition.
 
SECTION 3. RECALL.
   The electors shall have the power to remove from office by a recall election
any elected officer of the Municipality, in the manner provided herein. If an
elected officer shall have served for six (6) months of his or her term, a
petition demanding his or her removal may be filed with the Clerk of the
Council who shall note thereon the name and address of the person filing the
petition and the date of such filing. The petition and each part thereof
separately circulated shall contain the name and office of the person whose
removal is sought and a statement in not more than two hundred (200) words of
the grounds for the removal. Such petition shall be signed by at least that
number of electors which equals twenty-five percent (25%) in number of the
electors voting at the last preceding general election. Within ten (10) days
after the day on which such petition shall have been filed, the Clerk shall
determine whether or not it meets the requirements hereof. If the Clerk shall
find the petition sufficient, he or she shall promptly so certify to the
Council, shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the officer whose removal
is sought, and shall make a record of such delivery. If such officer shall not
resign within five (5) days after the day on which such delivery shall have
been made, the Council shall thereupon fix  a day for holding a recall
election, not less than sixty (60) nor more than seventy-five (75) days after
the date of such delivery. At such recall election this question shall be
placed on the ballot: "Shall (naming the officer) be allowed to continue as
(naming the office) ?" with provision on the ballot for voting affirmatively or
negatively on such question. If a majority of the votes cast at such election
shall be voted affirmatively, such officer shall remain in office. If a
majority of the votes cast shall be voted negatively, such officer shall be
considered as removed, his or her office shall be deemed vacant, and such
vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter. The officer removed by
such recall election shall not be eligible for appointment to the vacancy
created thereby.
 
SECTION 4. PETITIONS.
   An initiative, referendum or recall petition may be circulated in separate
parts, but the separate parts shall be bound together and filed as one
instrument. Each part shall contain in the case of the initiative or referendum
a full and correct copy of the title and text of the proposed or referred
ordinance or resolution. The manner of signing, the method of circulating, the

voting thereon, it shall become a part of this Charter; except that if two or
more inconsistent proposed amendments on the same subject shall be submitted at

CHAPTER 103
Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from
2 :00 a. m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in
October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.

consolidation or otherwise, the Franchise and/or Cable System or any of the

Council which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed and shall be
denied only upon a good faith finding by the City that the proposed transferee
lacks the legal, technical or financial qualifications to perform its
obligations under the Franchise Agreement, and then only upon such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Grantor may require.  Any attempt to sell,
transfer, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the Franchise and/or Cable
System without the consent of the Council shall be null and void.  This
provision shall not apply to sales of property or equipment in the normal
course of business.  No consent from the City shall be required for a transfer
in trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or in part,
to secure an indebtedness, or for a pro forma transfer to a corporation,
partnership or other entity controlling, controlled by or under common control
with Grantee.
   (b)   The following events shall be deemed to be a sale, assignment or other
transfer of the Franchise and/or Cable System requiring compliance with this
Section:
      (1)   The sale, assignment or other transfer of all or a majority of
Grantee's assets;
      (2)   The sale, assignment or other transfer of capital stock or

or other equity interest by Grantee so as to create a new controlling interest
in Grantee; and
      (4)   The entry by the Grantee into an agreement with respect to the
management or operation of the Grantee and/or the System.
   The term "Controlling Interest" as used herein means majority equity
ownership of the Grantee.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided below or unless waived by Grantor as
provided under Section
156.34 herein, no Grantee may sell or otherwise transfer ownership in a
Franchise and/or Cable System prior to the substantial completion of the
initial design or initial construction of said System by Grantee.  In the case
of a sale of multiple Systems, if the terms of the sale require the buyer to
subsequently transfer ownership of one or more such Systems to one or more
third parties, such transfer shall be considered a part of the initial
transaction.  The above-described holding period shall not apply to:
      (1)   Any transfer of ownership interest in any Franchise and/or Cable
System which is not subject to federal income tax liability;
      (2)   Any sale required by operation of any law or any act of any agency,
any State or political subdivision or the City; or
      (3)   Any sale, assignment, or transfer, to one or more purchasers,
assignees, or transferees controlled by, controlling, or under common control
with, the seller, assignor, or transferor or its affiliate.
   (d)   In the case of any sale or transfer of ownership of any Franchise and/
or Cable System, the City shall have one hundred twenty (120) days to act upon
any request for approval of such sale or transfer that contains or is
accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with Federal
Communications Commission Regulations, the requirements of this chapter and
such other reasonable information as the City, in its sole discretion, may
request. 
   During the review period, the Grantor may advise the Grantee that a public
hearing is deemed necessary to evaluate any potential adverse effect of the
sale or transfer upon Grantee's subscribers.  In such event Grantee shall
receive written notice of the hearing, and of the opportunity to participate
fully in it, as far in advance as possible, and in no event less than fourteen
(14) days prior to the start of the hearing.  If the City fails to render a
final decision on the request within one hundred twenty (120) days from receipt
by the City of all required information, such request shall be deemed granted
unless the requesting party and the City agree to an extension of time.  Such
request to transfer may be conditioned upon the performance of additional
requirements imposed upon Grantee by Grantor, and the payment of a
nonrefundable transfer fee of five thousand dollars ($5,000).
   (e)   Grantee shall notify Grantor in writing of any foreclosure or any
other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the Franchise property of
the Grantee or upon the termination of any lease or interest covering all or a
substantial part of said Franchise property. Such notification shall be
considered by Grantor as notice that a change in control or ownership of the
Franchise has taken place and the provisions under this Section governing the
consent of Grantor to such change in control or ownership shall apply.
   (f)   For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such
change, transfer, or acquisition of control, Grantor may inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and Grantee
shall assist Grantor in any such inquiry.  In seeking Grantor's consent to any
change of ownership or control, Grantee shall have the responsibility of
insuring that the transferee completes an application in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Grantor, which application shall include the
information required under State and federal law as well as under subsections
(b) (1)through (7) of Section156.13.  An application, acceptable to the City,
shall be submitted to Grantor not less than ninety (90) days prior to the date
of transfer.  The transferee shall be required to establish that it possesses
the legal, technical and financial qualifications to operate and maintain the
System and comply with all Franchise requirements for the remainder of the term
of the Franchise.  If, after considering the legal, financial, character and
technical qualities of the applicant and determining that they are
satisfactory, the Grantor finds that such transfer is acceptable, the Grantor
shall transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such Franchise.  The
consent of the Grantor to such transfer shall not be unreasonably denied.
   (g)   The consent or approval of the Grantor to transfer by the Grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the Grantor in or to
its public rights-of-way or easements and any transfer shall by its own terms
be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the
Franchise Agreement.  A sale, transfer or assignment of the Franchise may not
be approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to the
Franchise Agreement.
   (h)   Any financial institution having a pledge of the Grantee or its assets
for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the
Franchise shall have the right to notify the Grantor that it or its designee
satisfactory to the Grantor shall take control of and operate the Cable
Television System, in the event of a Grantee default in its financial
obligations.  Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for
such operation within thirty (30) days of assuming such control that will
insure continued service and compliance with all Franchise requirements during
the term the financial institution exercises control over the System.  The
financial institution shall not exercise control over the System for a period
exceeding one (1) year unless extended by the Grantor in its discretion and
during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the Grantor to
transfer the Franchise to another Grantee.
(Ord. 1997-25. Passed 12-9-97.)
   156.09  PURCHASE BY CITY.
   (a)    Grantor may, at any time, offer to purchase Grantee's Cable System
for the same consideration and other terms it is willing to accept from any
person.  The Grantee shall have 30 days from receipt of the offer from Grantor
within which to accept the offer.
   (b)    In any case where the Grantor elects to purchase the System, the
purchase shall be closed within 60 days of the date of Grantor's audit of a
current profit and loss statement of the Grantee.
(Ord. 1997-25. Passed 12-9-97.)
   156.10  GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE.
   (a)   Grantee shall design, construct and maintain the Cable Television
System to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit, school, library, and
municipal building in the Service Area, subject to any line extension
requirements of the Franchise Agreement.
   (b)   After service has been established by activating trunk and/or
distribution cables for any part of the Service Area, Grantee shall provide
Cable Service to any non-commercial Subscriber requesting a standard
installation within that part of the Service Area within seven (7) days from
the date of request if no further construction is required or within thirty
(30) days if construction is required, provided that the Grantee is able to
secure all rights-of-way necessary to extend service to such Subscriber on
reasonable terms and conditions within such thirty (30) day period.  For
purposes of this Section, a request shall be deemed made on the date of signing
a service agreement, receipt of funds by the Grantee, receipt of a written
request by the Grantee or receipt by the Grantee of a verified verbal request.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in the Franchise Agreement, Grantee shall
provide such service:
      (1)    With no line extension charge except as specifically authorized in
the Franchise Agreement.
      (2)    At a non-discriminatory installation charge for a Standard

by the Grantee.
      (3)    At non-discriminatory monthly rates for residential subscribers;
      (4)    Grantee may establish different and nondiscriminatory rates and
charges of services for commercial subscribers, as well as different,
nondiscriminatory monthly rates for classes of commercial subscribers upon
written notice to Grantor.
         (Ord. 1997-25. Passed 12-9-97.)
   156.11  NONEXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE.
   Any Franchise granted shall be nonexclusive.  The Grantor specifically
reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional Franchises for a
Cable Television System or any component thereof, as it deems appropriate,
subject to applicable State and federal law, provided, however, that no
Franchise shall be granted on terms materially less burdensome or more
favorable than any other Franchise granted hereunder.
(Ord. 1997-25. Passed 12-9-97.)
   156.12  MULTIPLE FRANCHISES.
   (a)   Grantor may grant one or more Franchises for a Service Area.
   (b)   Each Grantee awarded a Franchise to serve the entire City shall offer
service to all residences in the City, in accordance with construction and
service schedules mutually agreed upon between Grantor and Grantee, and
consistent with applicable law.
   (c)   Grantor may require that any new Grantee be responsible for its own
underground trenching and the costs associated therewith, if, in Grantor's
opinion, the rights-of-way in any particular area cannot feasiblely and
reasonably accommodate additional cables.
   (d)   Any additional Franchise granted by the City to provide Cable Service
in a part of the City in which a Franchise has already been granted and where
an existing Grantee is providing service shall require the new Grantee to
provide service throughout its Service Area within a reasonable time and in a
sequence which does not discriminate against lower income residents.
(Ord. 1997-25. Passed 12-9-97.)

Television System shall file an application with the City.  A nonrefundable

   (a)   Following the issuance and acceptance of a Franchise and as
compensation for the benefits and privileges granted under the Franchise and in
consideration of permission to use Grantor's Street and rights-of-way, the
Grantee shall pay to the Grantor a Franchise Fee upon Grantee's annual Gross
Revenues in the amount set forth in the Franchise Agreement.
   (b)   The Grantor, on an annual basis, shall be furnished a Statement within
one hundred twenty (120) days of the close of the calendar year, certified by
an officer of the Grantee or audited by a Certified Public Accountant,
reflecting and attesting to the total amounts of gross annual revenues and all
payments, and computations for the previous calendar year.  At any time and
upon thirty (30) days prior written notice and no more than once per calendar
year, Grantor shall have the right to conduct an independent audit of Grantee's
records, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and if
such audit indicates a Franchise Fee underpayment of five percent (5%) or more,
the Grantee shall assume all reasonable costs of such an audit.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided by law, no acceptance of any payment by
the Grantor shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of
any claim the Grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a
Franchise Fee under this chapter or any Franchise Agreement or for the
performance of any other obligation of the Grantee.
   (d)   In the event that any Franchise Fee payment or recomputed amount is
not made on or before the dates specified in the Franchise Agreement, Grantee

date, at an annual rate equal to the prime lending rate plus one and one-half
percent (1-1/2%) during the period for which payment was due.
   (e)   In the event any payment is not received within  thirty (30) calendar
days from its due date, Grantee shall further be assessed an additional amount
with regard to the payment of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day.  In the
event any payment is not received within seventy-five (75) calendar days from
its due date, Grantee shall be assessed an additional amount with regard to the
payment of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day.  Grantee's liability for
such amount in such cases shall not be subject to but shall be in addition to
the remedies set forth in Section156.29 herein for Franchise violations and may

the maximum amount of Franchise fees allowed by law which is presently set at
five percent (5%).  This maximum may be amended during the term of the
Franchise by any higher maximum amount that may be set by FCC regulations or
the Cable Act as the same may be amended from time to time.  Grantor may change
the percentage to be set forth in the Franchise Agreement by ordinance or
resolution of Grantor's Council and written notice to Grantee, as long as the
same does not exceed the maximum amount Grantor is authorized to collect as
allowed by law at the time of the changeand as long as Grantor collects the
same percentage from all other Cable Operators operating a Cable Television
System in the Franchise area.  Grantee shall implement the change within sixty
(60) days of written notice of the same by Grantor.
   (h)   No term or condition in this chapter or the Franchise Agreement shall
in any way modify or affect the Grantee's obligation to pay Franchise Fees. 
Although the total sum of Franchise fee payments and additional commitments set
forth elsewhere in this chapter or the Franchise Agreement may total more the
maximum allowable percentage of Grantee's gross revenues in any twelve-month
period, Grantee agrees that the additional commitments are not Franchise Fees
as defined under any federal law, nor are they to be offset or credited against
any Franchise Fee payments due to the Grantor, nor do they represent an
increase in Franchise fees to be itemized as such on the subscriber's bill.
   (i)   Payment of the Franchise Fee under this chapter or the Franchise
Agreement shall not exempt Grantee from the payment of any other license fee,
tax, levy, assessment or charge on the business, occupation, services, property
or income of the Grantee which is or may hereafter be lawfully imposed on all
entities engaged in the same business as Grantee.

requirements given the work the Grantee is performing, with the rights of any
property owner, or hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
      (6)    The Grantee shall at all times employ professional care and shall
install and maintain in use methods and devices to prevent failures and
accidents which risk damage, injury or nuisance to the public.
   (bb)   New Residential Developments. In new residential developments in
which all the electric power and telephone utilities are underground, the
following procedure shall apply with respect to access to and utilization of
underground easements:
      (1)   The developer shall be responsible for contacting and surveying all
Franchised cable operators to ascertain which operators desire (or, pursuant to
the terms and provisions of this chapter and any Franchise Agreement, may be
required) to provide Cable Service to that development.  The developer may
establish a reasonable deadline to receive cable operator responses.  The final
development map shall indicate the cable operators that have agreed to serve
the development.
      (2)   If one (1) or two (2) cable operators wish to provide service, they
shall be accommodated in the joint utilities trench on a nondiscriminatory
shared basis.  If fewer than two (2) operators indicate interest, the developer
shall provide conduit to accommodate two (2) sets of cable television cables
and dedicate to the City any initially unoccupied conduit.  The developer shall
be entitled to recover the cost of such initially unoccupied conduit in the
event that Grantor subsequently leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any
Grantee.
      (3)   The developer shall provide at least ten (10) working days notice
of the date that utility trenches will be open to the cable operators that have
agreed to serve the development.  When the trenches are open, cable operators
shall have two (2) working days to begin the Installation of their cables, and
five (5) working days after beginning Installation to complete Installation.
      (4)   The final development map shall not be approved until the developer
submits evidence that:
         A.   It has notified each Grantee that underground utility trenches
are to open as of an estimated date, and that each Grantee will be allowed
access to such trenches, including trenches from proposed Streets to individual
homes or home sites, on specified nondiscriminatory terms and conditions; and
         B.   It has received a written notification from each Grantee that the
Grantee intends to install its facilities during the open trench period on the
specified terms and conditions, or such other terms and conditions as are
mutually agreeable to the developer and Grantee, or has received no reply from
a Grantee within ten (10) days after its notification to such Grantee, in which
case the Grantee will be deemed to have waived its opportunity to install its
facilities during the open trench period.
      (5)   Sharing the joint utilities trench shall be subject to compliance
with State regulatory agency and utility standards.  If such compliance is not
possible, the developer shall provide a separate trench for the cable
television cables, with the entire cost shared among the participating cable
operators.  With the concurrence of the developer, the affected utilities and
the cable operators, alternative Installation procedures, such as the use of
deeper trenches, may be utilized, subject to applicable law.
      (6)   Any cable operator wishing to serve an area where the trenches have
been closed shall be responsible for its own trenching or other burial
operation and associated costs and shall repair all property to the condition
which existed prior to such trenching or burial.
      (7)   In the event that more than one Franchise is awarded, the City
reserves the right to require clustering of pedestals with other utilities or
Franchisees.
   (cc)   Street Improvements. Grantor shall give Grantees no less that forty-
five (45) days advance notice (or notice as soon as possible in cases of

excavation; construction repair; grading; traffic conditions; installation of
sewers; drains or water pipes; power or signal lines; tracks; or vacation or
improvement of public works. 
      (1)   All such public works shall be done, insofar as possible, in such a
manner as not to obstruct, injure, or prevent the free use and operation of the
poles, wires, conduits, conductors, pipes or appurtenances of the Cable
System.  Nothing contained herein shall relieve any person or entity from
liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid
interfering with Cable System facilities while performing the public works.
      (2)   If any equipment of Grantee shall interfere with public works,
then, upon receipt of the 45-day notice, that part of the equipment of Grantee
which interferes shall be removed or replaced by the Grantee in such manner as
shall be directed by Grantor so that the same shall not interfere with the
public works as reasonably determined by Grantor, and Grantee shall bear the
reasonable expense of such removal or replacement.

noncompliance, and such tests shall be limited to the particular matter in
controversy.  The Grantor shall endeavor to so arrange its request for such
special tests so as to minimize hardship or inconvenience to Grantee or the
Subscriber.  Failure to perform such properly requested additional tests within
thirty (30) days shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.

citizens in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the City or
any lawfully designated person, group, organization or agency authorized by the
City for that purpose.
   (b)   To the extent that any access Channel is not being used for the
provision of non-commercial, public, educational or governmental access
purposes, Grantee shall be permitted to use such Channel(s) for the provision
of other services subject to any reasonable rules established by the City
regarding such use.  Grantee's permitted use of any access Channel made
pursuant to this section shall cease within ninety (90) days of Grantee's
receipt of notice from City that such Channel will again be used for public,
educational or governmental access.
   (c)   Notwithstanding the above, Grantee may accommodate a request from the
City for additional access capacity made pursuant to subsection (b) hereof by
combining more than one access use on a Channel provided that:
      (1)   It is technically and economically feasible for Grantee to do so;
      (2)   The scheduling needs of all users of the Channel can be reasonably
accommodated; and
      (3)   The access entity which requires use of the alternate Channel must
be able to access the alternate Channel from the site where it normally
originates playback of its programs and may not be required to transport tapes
to a remote site for playback.
   (d)   However, Grantee shall provide an additional PEG Channel for  non-
commercial public, educational, or government broadcasts in the event that the
three (3) PEG Channel provided under this Section are then fully utilized.  In

As used in this section "fully utilized" mean utilized for original,
nonduplicative programming not less than eight (8) hours per day, five (5) days
per week, for a period of ten (10) consecutive weeks.  The additional PEG

Upon such annual review, the additional PEG Channel will continue to be made
available to Grantor to the extent that the PEG Channels provided under this
Agreement (including the additional PEG Channel(s)) are at least seventy
percent (70%) fully utilized.  To the extent that such capacity requirement is
not met, the additional PEG Channel shall be terminated subject to reactivation

utilized, and to the annual review provided herein.

modulation equipment to introduce programming onto these transmission
facilities by linking the below listed origination points with the headend, or

the origination points for such Channels.
   (f)   The Grantee is responsible for all headend equipment essential to
playback of programming for PEG access use in a location and under reasonable
rules determined by Grantee.  Grantee shall also be responsible for the
operation and maintenance, and all equipment necessary to perform those
functions.  Grantee shall also either provide a studio and equipment acceptable
to Grantor for PEG access use or pay a fee in lieu of providing the same equal

of Franchise fee) as stated in the Franchise Agreement to be placed by Grantor
in a special fund for such PEG access purposes. 
   (g)   The Grantor shall be responsible for the operation of Access
Facilities and equipment.  In this regard Grantor may delegate from time to
time its responsibilities to others who then shall assume the responsibility of
Grantor in accordance with the Grantor's delegation.  The Grantor will develop
reasonable rules regarding use of Access Facilities and equipment and determine
the needs of the City for public, educational and governmental access
services.  In this regard, the Grantor shall regularly coordinate with Grantee
for the purpose of developing and maintaining reasonable Access Facilities.
   (h)   Costs of providing said facilities shall not be a credit against
payment of the Franchise Fee imposed under the Franchise Agreement.

   156.29  FRANCHISE VIOLATION.
   (a)   If the Grantor believes that the Grantee has failed to perform any
obligation under this Agreement or has failed to perform in a timely manner,
the Grantor may make written demand on the Grantee that it remedy the alleged
failure.  Grantor may order the Grantee to correct or remedy and failure or
breach within the time and in the manner and on the terms and conditions that

from the Grantor and an opportunity to cure such nonperformance, Grantor  may
act to remedy such violation in accordance with the following procedures:
      Grantor shall notify Grantee of any alleged material violation in writing
by Personal delivery or registered or certified mail, and demand correction
within a reasonable time, which shall not be less than ten (10) days in the
case of the failure of the Grantee to pay any sum or other amount due the
Grantor under this chapter or the Grantee's Franchise and thirty (30) days in
all other cases.  If Grantee fails either to correct the violation within the
time prescribed or to commence correction of the violation within the time
prescribed and thereafter diligently pursue correction of such violation, the
Grantor shall then give written notice of not less than twenty (20) days of a
public hearing to be held before the Council.  Said notice shall specify the
violations alleged to have occurred.  At the public hearing, the Council shall
hear and consider relevant evidence and thereafter render findings and its
decision.  In the event that the Council finds that a material violation exists
and that Grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or has not
diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from
Grantor and is not diligently proceeding to fully remedy such violation, the
Council may revoke the Franchise or impose any other penalty permitted by the
Franchise agreement and any other legal or equitable remedy available under the
Franchise or applicable law.
   (e)   The Grantor may assess, after providing written notice to Grantee and
allowing  thirty (30) days or such other amount of time as is agreed between
Grantee and Grantor to cure, against the Grantee monetary damages up to five
hundred dollars ($500.00)per calendar day or per incident for material system
upgrade/construction delays, and up to two hundred dollars ($200.00) per
calendar day or per incident for any other material breaches; provided that all
violations of a similar nature occurring at the same time shall be considered
as one (1) incident.  The Grantor may have recourse to the Performance bond for
payment of such damages including the fifty dollar ($50.00) per day penalty for
failure to respond to Grantor's request for information due Grantor within the
time limits as specified in this chapter or the Franchise Agreement pursuant to
Section156.25(g) and the one hundred dollar ($100.00)  or five hundred dollar
($500.00) per day amounts for failure to timely pay the Franchise Fee pursuant
to Section156.18(e), which shall not be subject to but in addition to the
remedies set forth in this section.  The assessment of any monetary damages
shall not constitute a waiver by the Grantor of any other right or remedy it
may have under the Franchise or applicable law including its right to recover
from the Grantee any additional damages, losses, costs and expenses, including
attorney's and/or consultant fees that are incurred by the Grantor by reason of
the breach of this Agreement.
   (f)    In addition to revocation in accordance with other provisions of this
Agreement, Grantor may revoke this Agreement and rescind all rights and
privileges associated with the Franchise Agreement in the following

determines are reasonable under the circumstances.

provisions of this Section.

   (a)   In addition to any rights specifically reserved to the Grantor by this
chapter, the Grantor reserves to itself every right and power which is required
to be reserved by a provision of any ordinance or under the Franchise.
   (b)   The Grantor shall have the right to waive any provision of the
Franchise, except those required by federal or State regulation, if the Grantor
determines (1) that it is in the public interest to do so, and (2) that the
enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the Grantee or
the Subscribers.  To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a
Statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the
Grantor.  Waiver of any provision in one instance shall not be deemed a waiver
of such provision subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any
other provision of the Franchise unless the Statement so recites.

   156.35  RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.

research regarding viewers where individual viewing behavior cannot be
identified.
   (d)   In the conduct of providing its services or in pursuit of any
collateral commercial enterprise resulting therefrom, Grantee shall take

legal authority, utilize the System's interactive two-way equipment or

third parties (including Grantor), lists of the names and addresses of
subscribers, or any list which identifies, by name, subscriber viewing habits,

services without the express written consent of the subscriber to which the
personalized data pertains.  For the purposes of this subsection, "personalized
data" shall mean the name and address of an individual subscriber directly
associated with data obtained on his or her use of specific services provided

or any part thereof, to any agent, City officer or employee or created board,
authority or commission; provided, however, that the creation of any such
board, commission or authority, or the delegation of such authority to any City
employee or agent, shall not relieve the Grantor, acting through its City
Council, of  its ultimate authority and responsibility as Grantor hereunder and
that all final determinations required hereunder to be made by the Grantor

   156.39  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this chapter or any Franchise Agreement executed subject
to it is held by any court or by any federal, State or county agency of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid as conflicting with any federal or State
law, rule or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is held by such court or
agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any
such law, rule or regulation, such provision shall be considered a separate,
distinct, and independent part of this chapter, and such holding shall not
affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof, all of
which shall remain in full force and effect for the term of any Franchise
Agreement, or renewal or renewals thereof.  In the event of such determination
by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Grantor or Grantee shall have the
option to amend the parts of the Franchise Agreement related to the affected
sections  In the event that such law, rule or regulation is subsequently
repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision hereof

rule or regulation, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and
effect and shall thereafter be binding on Grantor and Grantee, provided that

notify the Cable Operator and make an investigation to determine whether or not
there is a probable cause to credit the allegations.  If the Complaint Officer
determines after such investigation that there is probable cause to credit the
allegations of the complaint, the Complaint Officer shall notify the Cable
Operator and complainant and promptly endeavor to resolve the matter by
conciliation and persuasion.  In the event that the Complaint Officer is unable
to obtain conciliation within a reasonable time, the matter shall be promptly
set for a hearing where all parties may give evidence and the merits of the
dispute will be decided.  The Complaint Officer shall make the decision public,
along with a statement reciting the basis therefor.  Within thirty (30) days

attempting to procure the contract bid upon, and further agreeing that no such

Such noncollusion affidavit shall be on the form provided with the instructions

(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.07  PROPOSAL GUARANTY.
   Each proposal shall be accompanied by a certified check on a solvent bank in
the County, made payable only to the City, with no restrictions thereon, in an
amount not less than ten percent of the total amount of the proposal, or, in
lieu of such a check, a bid bond, in favor of the City, in an amount not less
than ten percent of the total amount of the proposal. All sureties issuing bid
bonds shall be duly authorized and qualified to do business in the State and
must, upon request of the Law Director, furnish a certificate of authority and
compliance from the office of the State Superintendent of Insurance. The
certified check or bid bond shall be furnished as surety that, if the proposal

contract properly secured within ten days from the date of notice to the bidder
of the award of the contract.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)

forfeited to the City, as the agreed amount of liquidated damages, in case of
failure to enter into a contract for the work bid upon. In such case, the
contract may, at the discretion of the City, be readvertised or awarded to the
next lowest bidder.
   The bid bonds or certified checks of all unsuccessful bidders shall be
returned within thirty days of the award and execution of a contract, or the
rejection of all bids, whichever is later. The bid bond or certified check of
the successful bidder shall be returned after such bidder has executed a
contract and the performance bond required pursuant to Section

(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.09  UNACCEPTABLE PROPOSALS.

any debt or contract, or who is in default, as surety or otherwise, upon any
obligation to the City.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.10  EXAMINATION OF SITE OF WORK, QUANTITIES, SCOPE OF WORK.
   The bidder is required to examine carefully the site of the work, the
proposal form, the plans and specifications and all contract documents for the
work contemplated. The bidder in submitting a proposal, warrants that he or she
has investigated and is acquainted with the conditions to be encountered for
performing the work, including the character, quality and quantities of work to
be performed and materials to be furnished, the prevailing hourly wage rates
for the area as prescribed by law and all requirements of the contract
documents. Submission of a proposal shall be considered prima-facie evidence
that the bidder has made such examination and is satisfied as to all conditions
which will affect the work.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.11  WITHDRAWAL OF BIDS.
   A bidder may withdraw his or her proposal provided his or her written
request for such withdrawal is delivered to the Clerk of Council twenty-four
hours prior to the time set for the opening of proposals. When such proposal is
reached during the bid opening period, it will be returned to the bidder
unopened. No proposal shall be returned to a bidder, and no bidder shall be
permitted to withdraw his or her proposal, under any circumstances except as
provided herein.
   After a bidder has requested withdrawal of a proposal in writing, in the
manner stated above, he or she may submit a new proposal, provided it is
properly identified as such and provided, further, that it is in the hands of
the official who will open the proposals prior to the time and date set for
such opening.
   The City expressly reserves the right to increase or diminish the quantities
of work and/or omit altogether any items shown on the proposal form, as the
Service Director and/or the City Engineer may deem advisable and/or necessary.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.12  OPENING AND CONSIDERATION OF BIDS; REJECTION OF BIDS.
   Proposals will be received until the hour and date set for the opening
thereof and must be in the hands of the official who will open the same prior
to that time. After the proposals are opened and read, the totals will be
compared and the results of such comparison will be made public. Until the
final award of a contract, the City reserves the right to reject any or all
proposals, or any part of any proposal, and to waive any technical errors or
informalities in the bidding as such waiver may be deemed to be in the best
interests of the City.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.13  AWARD OF CONTRACT.
   The award of the contract, if it is awarded, will be to the lowest and best
bidder whose proposal complies with all the requirements prescribed. The City
reserves the right to consider all elements entering into the question of
determining the qualifications and responsibility of any bidder.  The City may
accept a proposal and award a contract which is greater or less in any amount
than the Service Director's or City Engineer's estimate pursuant to Section
158.03. Where bids are taken in the form of separate proposals on portions of
one project, the work will ordinarily be awarded to the contractor, otherwise
qualified, whose combined bid is the lowest. No bidder bidding on all such
proposals shall be required to enter into a contract covering less than the
entire project without his or her consent.
   The award, if made, will be made within sixty days after opening the
proposals, unless the time for awarding and executing the contract is extended
by mutual consent of the City and the bidder whose proposal the City accepts.
No increase shall be made in the contract price for any damages, costs or
expenses incurred by the bidder as a result of such extension unless such
increase is specifically approved in writing by the City as a change order to
the contract. In no case will a contract award be made until the certification
of funds by the Finance Director and all necessary investigations are made as
to the responsibility of the bidder to whom it is proposed to award the
contract.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.14  PERFORMANCE BOND.
   Within five days after receiving notice of an award and before entering into
a contract the successful bidder will be required to furnish a performance bond
to the City in the full amount of the contract, which binds the surety whether
or not it receives notice of the award of the contract, the condition of which
bond shall be the full and complete execution and performance of all of the
terms contained in the contract documents.
   The bond shall be subject to the approval of the City as to sufficiency and
form, and the company issuing the performance bond and the sureties thereof
must be duly authorized and qualified to do business in the State and must,
upon request of the Law Director, furnish a certificate of authority and
compliance from the office of the State Superintendent of Insurance.
Such bond shall not be released until all provisions of the contract have been
fulfilled.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.15  EXECUTION OF CONTRACT; FAILURE TO EXECUTE CONTRACT.
   The contract shall be properly signed by the successful bidder and returned,
together with the performance bond. If the contract is awarded to an out-of-
State corporation, a certificate must be issued by the Secretary of State that
such corporation is authorized to do business in Ohio. The contract, the
performance bond and, in the case of out-of-State corporations, the
certificate, must be returned to the City within ten days after the bidder has
received notice that the contract has been awarded. No award shall be
considered binding upon the City until the execution of the contract. A
contract shall be deemed executed when it is signed by the bidder and, on
behalf of the City, by the Mayor, when it is certified by the Finance Director
as required by law, when it is secured by the required performance bond and
when it is approved as to legal form by the Law Director. The successful
bidder, upon his or her request, shall be entitled to a notice to proceed as
soon as the contract is executed and shall be ready to proceed as soon as
instructed to do so by the City.
   Failure to execute a contract and file an acceptable performance bond and
affidavit within the time and as provided in this chapter shall be cause for
annulment of the award and the forfeiture of the proposal guaranty to the City,
not as a penalty but as liquidated damages. The contract may then be awarded to
the next lowest bidder or the work may be re-advertised, at the discretion of
the City.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.16  CONTRACT CONDITIONS.
   Every contract shall contain the conditions set forth in this chapter, all
provisions required by the City Charter to be set forth therein and such other
provisions, terms and conditions as the Law Director and the City Engineer deem
necessary or appropriate.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.17  PUBLIC LIABILITY, PROPERTY DAMAGE AND AUTOMOBILE  INSURANCE.
   (a)    The contractor shall at his or her expense, take out and maintain,
during the life of the contract, public liability and property damage
insurance, in the amounts specified in the contract documents, as will protect
himself or herself, the City and any subcontractor performing work covered by
the contract, from claims for damages for personal injury, including accidental
death, as well as from claims for property damages which may arise from
operations under the contract, whether such operation is by himself or herself
or by any subcontractor or by anyone directly or indirectly employed by either
of them. An exact copy of such policy shall be deposited with the City before
the commencement of any work under the contract.
   (b)    The following special hazards shall be covered during the life of the
contract by riders to the policy required herein, or by separate insurance
policies, in the amounts specified in the contract documents:

performance of the contract;

performance of the contract; and
      (3)    Public liability and property damage insurance to cover the use of
explosives used in the performance of the contract.
   (c)    All insurance policies shall name the City as an additional insured
and provide that ten days prior to cancellation or reduction of the insurance
afforded by the policy written notice will be mailed to the City.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.18  WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE.
   The contractor shall, at his or her sole expense, take out and maintain,
during the life of the contract, workers' compensation insurance for all of his
or her employees employed at the site of the project and, in case any work is
sublet, the contractor shall require the subcontractor similarly to provide
workers' compensation insurance for all of the latter's employees, unless such
employees are covered by the protection afforded by the contractor.
   Such insurance shall be evidenced by a certificate from the Industrial
Commission of Ohio that the contractor has complied with each and every
condition of the Act of February 26, 1913, as amended and supplemented, known
as the Workers' Compensation Law. The contractor shall save the City harmless
from any and all liability arising from or under the Workers' Compensation Law.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.19  SOCIAL SECURITY.
   The contractor shall be and remain an independent contractor with respect to
all services performed under the contract and shall agree to accept full and
exclusive liability for the payment of any and all contributions or taxes for
social security, unemployment insurance or old age retirement benefits,
pensions or annuities, now or hereafter imposed under any State or Federal law,
which are measured by the wages, salaries or other remuneration paid to persons
employed by the contractor on work performed under the terms of the contract.
The contractor shall indemnify and save harmless the City from any such
contributions, taxes or liability therefor.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.20  PREVAILING RATE OF WAGES.
   Each laborer, workman or mechanic employed by the contractor for the work
specified, by a subcontractor or by other persons upon such work, shall be paid
at the minimum prevailing wage as determined by the State Department of
Industrial Relations, Division of Building and Factory Inspection, or such
higher or lower rate as may be specified in the contract documents.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.21  LABOR AND MATERIAL SUPPLIERS.
   The contractor shall promptly pay or satisfy the just and equitable claims
of all persons who have performed labor or furnished material for the
contractor in the execution of the contract, including those who have
previously filed attested accounts of such claims with the City, and all bills,
costs or claims of whatever kind which might in law or equity become a lien
upon the work or against the fund from which the same is to be paid or a charge
against the City. The contractor shall indemnify and hold the City harmless
from any cost, claim, liability or expense arising from any claim against the
City or against any fund of the City.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.22  OTHER LAWS, PERMITS AND REGULATIONS.
   The contractor shall be required to comply with all other applicable
Federal, State and local laws and regulations and shall be responsible for
securing, at his or her own expense, any and all licenses, permits and
certificates of inspection required by law or by the contract documents. (Ord.
1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.23  ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACTS.
   The contractor shall not assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of
the contract, or his or her right or obligation to execute it, or his or her
right, title or interest in it or to it or any part thereof, or assign, by
power of attorney or otherwise, any of the moneys due or to become due under
the contract, without the consent of the City. The giving of any such consent
to a particular assignment shall not dispense with the necessity of such
consent to any further or other assignments.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.24  SUBCONTRACTORS.
   The contractor shall not sublet any part of the contract without the
previous written consent of the City. Subletting, if permitted, shall not
relieve the contractor, or his or her surety, of any of his, her or its
obligations under the contract and the contractor shall remain solely
responsible to the City for the acts or defaults of his, her or its
subcontractor. The contractor shall promptly, upon request of the City, file a
confirmed copy of any subcontract with prices and terms of payment deleted, as
a condition precedent to the approval of a subcontractor. The contractor and
subcontractor shall jointly and severally agree that no obligation is thereby
created upon the City to pay, or see to the payment of, any sums to any
subcontractor. (Ord. 1981. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.25  TERMS OF PAYMENT.
   (a)    Monthly Estimates.  During the progress of the contract work, the
City Engineer or Service Director shall prepare monthly estimates based upon
the amount of acceptable work done and in place and upon acceptable material
delivered to the site in reasonable amounts and in proper condition. The City
shall, within sixty days of the date the Engineer or Director approves such
estimate, pay the contractor ninety-two percent of the total value of
acceptable work in place, less former payments, provided the same is free from
any attested accounts, or from any claims for damages which might in any manner
become a liability or charge against the City, and provided no legal restraints
are placed upon the City preventing such payment. The retainage shall be held
exclusively by the City and no escrow accounts will be authorized or required.
The allowance and payment of such estimates shall not be deemed a final
acceptance by the City of the work or material therein included.
   (b)    Final Estimate.  The Engineer or Director shall, as soon as practical
after the completion of the entire work by the contractor, make a complete and
final estimate of the work and accept or reject the same. Within sixty days
after written final acceptance of the work by the Engineer or Director, the
City shall pay to the contractor the whole amount of the money then due the
contractor under the contract, less the amount prescribed in Section
158.26 to be retained as a guaranty and less any sums which may have been
expended by the City under the provisions of the contract, provided the same is
free from any attested accounts or from any claims for damages which might in
any manner become a liability or charge against the City and provided no legal
restraints are placed upon the City preventing such payment.
   Acceptance by the contractor of such final estimate shall constitute a
release to the City, and all of its officers or agents, from all claims of, and
liability to, the contractor for any reason whatsoever except claims for final
payment of the guaranty fund as provided for in Section
158.26.
   All prior partial estimates shall be subject to correction in the final
estimate, and the final estimate shall be subject to correction before release
and payment of the guaranty fund.
   Neither the acceptance of any work by the City, nor the issuance of the
final estimate, nor the payment upon such estimate nor the making of any
special repairs by the City, shall in any way be held or construed as relieving
the contractor and his or her surety from full compliance with all requirements
of the contract and guaranty.
(Ord. 1981-11. Passed 3-10-81.)
   158.26  GUARANTY OF MATERIALS AND WORKMANSHIP; FINAL PAYMENT.
   The contractor shall guarantee all materials and workmanship furnished and
used in the improvement for a period of two years, or such other period as may
be specified in the contract documents, after approval of the final estimate by
the City Engineer or Service Director.  The contractor shall post a maintenance
bond in the amount of twenty percent (20%) of the total contract price to
secure that the materials and workmanship will remain in good and sound
condition during the two-year period, or such other period as may be specified
in the contract.

CHAPTER 161
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Independence has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of an
Independence ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving
moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the
corporate limits of Independence, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C.
2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping his docket and file, the Mayor shall be
governed by the laws pertaining to county courts. Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides
that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an offense is not a
court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such that a right to a
jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him unless the
accused, by writing subscribed by him, waives a jury and consents to be tried
by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such event, does not waive right to
jury trial, then the magistrate shall require the accused to enter into
recognizance to appear before a court of record in Cuyahoga County (the
Garfield Heights Municipal Court), and the magistrate shall thereupon certify
all papers filed, together with a transcript of proceedings and accrued costs
to date, and such recognizance, if given, to the court of record. However, Rule
23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that in petty offense
cases, where there is a right of jury trial, the defendant shall be tried by
the court unless he demands a jury trial. But the jurisdiction of a Mayor's
Court, in such cases, is further limited by Rule 9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules,
which provides that if a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23,
and the defendant waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try
the case only if (1) his compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon
criminal case convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and
administrative officer of the municipality and as such responsible for the
financial condition of the municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be
taken by any mayor.
   Ohio R. C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that right to trial by jury shall be
claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the clerk
of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for trial
or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for trial,
whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that jury trial may not be had in courts not of record, but
failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Independence ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts inferior to Common
Pleas," the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend or revoke the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
333.01 of the Traffic Code (DWI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

   183.01  DEFINITIONS.
   (a)    Generally.  For the purposes of this chapter, the terms, phrases,
words and their derivatives shall have the meanings given in this section. The
singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall include the feminine
and the neuter.
   (b)    Administrator.  “Administrator” means the Finance Director or his
authorized representative.
   (c)    Hotel or Motel.  “Hotel” or “motel” means every establishment kept,
used, maintained, advertised or held out to the public to be a place where

   (d)    Transient Guest.  “Transient guests” means a person occupying a room
or rooms for sleeping accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (e)   Vendor.  “Vendor” means the person who is the owner or operator of the

(Ord. 1972-27. Passed 3-14-72.)
   183.02  PURPOSE, RATE AND APPLICATION OF TAX.
   For the purpose of providing revenue for the City, there is hereby levied an
excise tax on transactions by which lodging by a hotel or motel is or is to be
furnished to transient guests. The tax shall be three percent of the amount
paid or to be paid by the transient guest for the lodging.
   The tax, which shall be known as the transient occupancy tax, applies and is
collectible at the time the lodging is furnished, regardless of the time when
the price is paid. The tax does not apply to lodging furnished to the State or
any of its political subdivisions. For the purpose of the proper administration
of this chapter and to prevent evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all
lodging furnished by hotels in the City to transient guests is subject to the
tax until the contrary is established.
(Ord. 1972-27. Passed 3-14-72.)
   183.03  PAYMENT OF TAX.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest to the
vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full and
exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging. The tax required to be
collected under this chapter shall be deemed to be held in trust by the vendor
until paid to the Administrator as provided in Section
183.06. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the vendor, the
Administrator may require that such tax be paid directly to the Administrator.
   No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time
rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the
Administrator. All claims of exemption shall be made in the manner prescribed
by the Administrator.
(Ord. 1972-27. Passed 3-14-72.)
   183.04  RECORDS.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon. Such records shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the Administrator and shall be
preserved for a period of three years, unless the Administrator, in writing,
consents to their destruction within that period, or by order requires that
they be kept longer.
(Ord. 1972-27. Passed 3-14-72.)
   183.05  TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   The tax shall be stated and charged separately from the charge for the
lodging and shall be shown separately on any record thereof at the time the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for the occupancy issued or
delivered by the vendor.
   No vendor shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or
indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the
vendor, or that it will not be added to the amount charged for the lodging, or
that, if added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 1972-27. Passed 3-14-72.)
   183.06  RETURNS REQUIRED.
   Each vendor shall, on or before the last day of the month, make and file a
return for the preceding month, on forms prescribed by the Administrator,
showing the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax due from the
vendor to the City for the period covered by the return, and such other
information as the Administrator deems necessary for the proper administration
of this chapter. The Administrator may extend the time for making and filing
returns. Returns shall be filed by delivering or mailing the same to the
Administrator together with payment of the full amount of tax shown to be due
thereon.
   The Administrator may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not such as
to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Administrator upon the basis of
administrative costs of the City, to make and file returns at less frequent
intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate the
intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   All claims for exemption from tax filed by transient guests with the vendor
during the reporting period shall be filed with the return.
   All returns and payments submitted by each vendor shall be treated as
confidential by the Administrator and shall not be released by him except upon
order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the
United States, the State, the County or the City, for official use only.
   The Administrator, if he deems it necessary in order to insure the payment
of the tax imposed by this chapter, may require returns and payments to be made
for other than monthly periods. The returns shall be signed by the vendor or
his authorized agent.
(Ord. 1972-27. Passed 3-14-72.)
   183.07  REFUNDS.
   The Administrator shall refund or grant credits to vendors for the amount of
taxes paid illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous
assessment where the vendor had not reimbursed himself from the transient
guest. A transient guest may obtain a refund or credit for the amount of taxes
paid illegally or erroneously but only when the tax was paid by the transient
guests directly to the Administrator. No refund shall be paid unless the
claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing his
entitlement thereto and makes a claim in writing on forms furnished by the
Administrator, stating, under penalty of perjury, the specific grounds upon
which the claim is founded. Such claim shall be filed with the Administrator
within three years of the date of payment.
(Ord. 1972-27. Passed 3-14-72.)
   183.08  FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION BY ADMINISTRATOR.
   If any vendor fails or refuses to collect the transient occupancy tax or to
file a return and to make a remittance of the tax or any portion thereof, as
required by this chapter, the Administrator shall proceed in such manner as he
deems best to obtain information on which to base his estimate of the tax due.
When the Administrator has such information as he is able to obtain upon which
to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any
vendor who has failed or refused to collect the same or to file a return and to
make a remittance of the proper amount thereof, he shall proceed to determine
and assess against such vendor the tax, penalty and interest provided for in
this chapter.
   In case such determination is made, the Administrator shall give notice of
the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by registered or certified
mail. Such vendor may, within ten days after the serving or mailing of such
notice, make application in writing to the Administrator for a hearing on the
amount assessed. If application by the vendor is not made within the time
prescribed, the tax, penalty and interest determined by the Administrator shall
become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such
application is made, the Administrator shall give not less than five days
written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the vendor to show
cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein
should not be fixed for such tax, penalty and interest. At any such hearing,
the vendor may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, penalty and
interest should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Administrator shall
determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written
notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of such
determination and the amount of such tax, penalty and interest. The amount
determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days.
(Ord. 1972-27. Passed 3-14-72.)
   183.09  APPEALS.
   Appeals from any ruling or determination of the Administrator with respect
to the amount of the transient occupancy tax, penalty and interest shall be
made to Council.
(Ord. 1972-27. Passed 3-14-72.)
   183.10  ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the City.
Any such tax collected by a vendor which has not been paid to the City shall be
deemed a debt owed by the vendor to the City. Any person owing money to the
City under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought
in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 1972-27. Passed 3-14-72.)
   183.11  RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Administrator shall have power to adopt rules and regulations, not
inconsistent with the terms of this chapter, for carrying out and enforcing the
payment, collection and remittance of the transient occupancy tax. A copy of
such rules and regulations shall be published, as in the case of ordinances,
before they become effective and copies shall be printed and made available in
the office of the Administrator.
(Ord. 1972-27. Passed 3-14-72.)
   183.12  INTERPRETATION.
   It is the intent of this chapter to levy an excise tax of three percent on
transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient
guests as referred to and authorized by Ohio R. C. 5739. 02(C). Accordingly,
this chapter shall be construed to effectuate that purpose and so as to be
consistent with any requirement of law, compliance with which is a prerequisite
to the validity of the tax intended to be levied hereby.
(Ord. 1972-27. Passed 3-14-72.)
   183.99  PENALTY.
   (a)    Any vendor who fails to collect or remit any tax imposed by this
chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten percent of
the amount of the tax and interest at the rate of six percent per year upon the
unpaid amount in addition to the tax.
   (b)    Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall be fined
not more than five hundred dollars ($500. 00) or imprisoned not more than six
months, or both.

DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX
   191.0701  METHOD OF DETERMINATION.
   (a)   In the taxation of income which is subject to City income taxes, If
the taxpayer shall disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net
profit is attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted
within the boundaries of the City, then only such portion shall be considered
as having a taxable situs in the City for the purposes of municipal income
taxation.  The portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer to be allocated
as having been derived from within the City, shall be determined as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll, and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight as follows:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all real and
tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated:
   As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed excluding compensation that is not taxable pursuant to
Section 718.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed;
   (b)   If the formula in subsection a does not produce an equitable result,
another basis may be used as a substitute method under uniform regulations so
as to produce such a result.  If books and records are used, the following
shall apply:
   The net profits allocable to the city from business, professional or other
activities conducted in the city by corporations or unincorporated entities
(whether resident or non- resident) may be determined from the records of the
taxpayer only if the taxpayer has bona fide records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy what portion of his net profits is attributable to that
part of his activities conducted within the city.
   If the books and records of the taxpayer are used as the basis for
apportioning net profits, a statement must accompany the return explaining the
manner in which such apportionment is made in sufficient detail to enable the
administrator to determine whether the net profits attributable to the city are
apportioned with reasonable accuracy.
   In determining the income allocable to the city from the books and records
of a taxpayer, an adjustment may be made for the contribution made to the
production of such income by headquarters activities of the taxpayer, whether
such headquarters is within or without the city.
   (c)    This section shall not apply to individuals who are residents of the
city.   
(Ord. 2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)
   191.0702  SALES MADE IN THE CITY.
   As used in Section
191.0701(a)(3)“Sales Made in the City” means:
   (a)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
City regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a stock of
goods within the City;
   (b)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
City regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point
outside the City if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees
in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the sales results
from such solicitation or promotion;
   (c)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place
within the City to purchasers outside of the City regardless of where title
passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in
the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made. 
      (Ord.  2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)
   191.0703  TOTAL ALLOCATION.
   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with subsections (1),
(2), and (3) of Section
191.0701(a) or such of the aforesaid percentages as are applicable to the
particular taxpayer and divide the total so obtained by the number of
percentages used in deriving such total in order to obtain the business
allocation percentage referred to in Section
191.0701.
   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the City.

191.0501, only if and to the extent that the rental ownership, management or
operations of the real estate from which such rentals are derived (whether so
rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through agents or
other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole
or in part.
   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties, regardless of
number and value, aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month, it shall be prima- facie evidence that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of such properties is a business activity of such
taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to tax;
provided that in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month; provided further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall
be considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in crops or when
the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from
the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds such two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per month; and provided further that the person who operates
a licensed rooming house shall be considered in business whether or not the
gross income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month.
(Ord. 2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)

allocation as he deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper allocation of
net profits to the City.

191.1302,
      (2)   Where any portion of the tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of Section

balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return. 
   (b)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied

chapter undergoes a fundamental change, then the employer and his or her
manager shall be liable for taxes due up to the date of the fundamental
change.  Taxes and final tax returns shall be due immediately after the
fundamental change.  Any successor employer shall withhold, from any purchase
price that the successor owes to the predecessor, an amount sufficient to pay
all unpaid taxes, interest and penalties which the predecessor employer owes
pursuant to this chapter.  The successor employer shall make such withholding
until such time that the predecessor employer has paid such taxes, interest and
penalties.  If the successor fails to withhold such amount, then the successor
and, in a personal manner, the successor’s manager, shall be jointly and
severally liable for the payment of such taxes, interest and penalties.

shall, on or before the last day of each month, make return and pay to the
Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted during the previous month.
However, if the amount of the tax so deducted by any employer in any one month

of a return and payment of the amount deducted until the last day of the month
following the end of the calendar quarter in which such month occurred.
   (b)   Returns shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to the

regulations prescribed therefore by the Administrator.  The employer shall be
liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld whether
or not such taxes have, in fact, been withheld.
   (c)   The employer in collecting the tax shall be deemed to hold the same
until payment is made by such employer to the City as a trustee for the benefit
of the City and any such tax collected by such employer from his employees
shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in the hands
of such employer.
   (d)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him exclusively in or about
such person’s residence, even though such residence is in the City, but such
employee shall be subject to all of the requirements of this chapter. 
   (e)   (1)   Every manager is deemed to be a trustee of this Municipality in
collecting and holding the tax required under this chapter to be withheld, and
the funds so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds.  Every

whether actually collected by such employer or not.  Any tax deducted and
withheld shall be considered paid to this Municipality, whether or not the
employer actually remits the tax to this Municipality, for purposes of
determining employee payments or credits.
      (2)   All managers shall be personally liable to the extent of the tax,
interest and penalty, jointly and severally, for failure to file the employer’s
return or to pay the employer’s tax, interest and penalty as required under
this chapter.
      (3)   No change in structure by an employer, including a fundamental
change, discharges its managers from liability for the employees’ or manager’s
failure to remit funds held in trust, to file a tax return or to pay taxes.

equal to 100 percent of the amount obtained by multiplying the lower of the tax
rate of such other municipality or of the City of Independence by the taxable

income due the municipality for income tax or withholding paid on said income
or wages.
   (d)   Pursuant and subject to the requirements of Section 718.14 of the Ohio

for herein, must be filed with the Administrator on or before December 31, of
the year following that for which such credit is claimed; provided that, in the
case such claim for reciprocity refund shall have been assigned to the
municipality of residence, such municipality of residence shall file a claim
for refund with the Administrator of the City on or before January 31,
following.  Failure to file such claim for reciprocity credit or refund, or
assignment thereof, within the time prescribed herein shall render such credit
claim for refund or assignment null and void.

payments thereof.
(Ord.  2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)
   191.2303  AUTHORITY TO MAKE AND ENFORCE REGULATIONS.
   The Administrator is hereby charged with the enforcement of the provisions
of this chapter, and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of the Board
of Review, to adopt and promulgate and to enforce rules and regulations
relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection of taxes and the
administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including
provisions for the re-examination and correction of returns. 
(Ord. 2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)
   191.2304  AUTHORITY TO ARRANGE INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS.
   The Administrator is authorized to arrange for the payment of unpaid taxes,
interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments when the taxpayer
has proved to the Administrator that, due to certain hardship conditions, he is
unable to pay the full amount of the tax due.  Such authorization shall not be
granted until proper returns are filed by the taxpayer for all amounts owed by
him under this chapter.
   Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total unpaid
amount, including penalty and interest, to become payable on demand and the
provisions of Sections
191.1701 and
191.1505 of this chapter shall apply.
(Ord.  2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)
   191.2305  AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE AMOUNT OF TAX DUE.
   (a)   Preparation of Return by Administrator.  If any taxpayer fails to file
a tax return, which is required by this chapter, within the time prescribed
therefor, but consents to disclose all information necessary to the preparation
thereof, then the Administrator may prepare such return which, after being
signed by such person, may be received by the Administrator as the return of
such person.
   (b)   Execution of Return by Administrator.  If any taxpayer fails to file a
tax return, which is required by this chapter, within the time prescribed
therefore, or makes, willfully or otherwise, a false or fraudulent return, then
the Administrator shall make in a reasonable manner, such return from his or
her own knowledge and from such information as he or she can obtain through
testimony or otherwise. 
   (c)   Assessment of a Taxpayer by Administrator.  The Administrator may
calculate and assess any taxpayer for the amount of tax, penalty and interest
which is imposed by this chapter and which is due and owing.  Such assessment
shall be made by the Administrator’s issuing summary records to the last known
address of the taxpayer of the assessment.  This summary shall include the
identification of the taxpayer, the character of the liability assessed, the
taxation period and the amount of the assessment. 
   (d)   Status of Executed Returns and Assessments.  Any return executed by,
or any assessment made by, the Administrator pursuant to this chapter shall be
prima-facie good and sufficient for all legal purposes.  The Administrator may
execute supplemental tax returns and may issue supplemental assessments
whenever the Administrator has knowledge derived from any source, including the
taxpayer’s financial data, that any executed tax return or assessment is
imperfect or incomplete in any material respect. 
   (e)   Limitation of Prosecutions.  Neither the Tax Administrator’s execution
of a return nor the Tax Administrator’s assessment of a taxpayer shall start
the running of the period of limitations on prosecutions set forth in this
chapter.
(Ord.  2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)
   191.2306  AUTHORITY TO MAKE INVESTIGATIONS.
   The Administrator or any authorized employee is hereby authorized to examine
the books, papers, records and Federal income tax returns of any employer or of
any taxpayer or person subject to, or whom the Administrator believes is
subject to the provisions of this chapter, for the purpose of verifying the
accuracy of any return made, or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due under this chapter.  Every such employer, supposed employer, taxpayer or
supposed taxpayer is hereby directed and required to furnish upon written
request by the Administrator or his duly authorized agent or employee, the
means, facilities and opportunity for making such examinations and
investigations as are hereby authorized.
(Ord. 2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)
   191.2307  AUTHORITY TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF RECORDS.
   The Administrator is hereby authorized to order any person presumed to have
knowledge of the facts to appear before him and may examine such person, under
oath, concerning any income which was or should have been returned for taxation
or any transaction tending to affect such income, and for this purpose may
compel the production of books, papers, records and Federal income tax returns
and the attendance of all persons before him, whether as parties or witnesses,
whenever he believes such persons have knowledge of such income or information
pertinent to such inquiry.
(Ord.  2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)
   191.2308  REFUSAL TO PRODUCE RECORDS.
   The refusal to produce books, papers, records and Federal income tax
returns, or the refusal to submit to such examination by an employer or persons
subject or presumed to be subject to the tax or by any officer, agent or
employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax or the
failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this chapter or with an
order or subpoena of the Administrator authorized hereby shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter, punishable as provided in Section
191.1505.
(Ord.  2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)
   191.2309  CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF INFORMATION.
   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations, hearings, or
verifications required or authorized by Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised Code or
by an ordinance of the city is confidential, and no person shall disclose such
information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection
with the performance of that person’s official duties or the official business
of the city as authorized by said chapter or ordinance authorizing the tax. 
The Administrator may furnish copies of returns filed under this chapter to the
Internal Revenue Service and to the Tax Commissioner.  Any person divulging
such information in violation of this section, shall be subject to a fine or
penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned for not
more than six months, or both.  Each disclosure shall constitute a separate
offense.
   In addition to the above penalty, any employee of the City who violates the
provisions of this section relative to the disclosures of confidential
information shall be guilty of an offense punishable by immediate dismissal.
(Ord.  2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)

withholding taxes are paid.
(Ord. 2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)
   191.2311  AUTHORITY TO CONTRACT FOR CENTRAL COLLECTION FACILITIES.
   Because the City has entered into an agreement for the establishment of a
Regional Council of Governments pursuant to Ordinance 1971-31, which Council
has organized a municipal tax collection agency known as the Regional Income
Tax Agency, the Board of Trustees of such Regional Income Tax Agency is
authorized to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter as the
agent of the City, and the duties and authority of the Administrator hereunder
may be performed by the Board of Trustees of such agency through the
Administrator of such agency.  However, the Administrator of such agency shall
have no authority to abate penalties or interest provided for in Sections
191.1501 and
191.1502. 
(Ord.  2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)
   191.2312  OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY.
   Notwithstanding Section
191.1103, on and after January 1, 2005, any taxpayer that is subject to the
city’s tax on the net profit from a business or profession and which has
received an extension to file the federal income tax return shall not be
required to notify the city of the federal extension and shall not be required
to file any annual return until the last day of the month following that to
which the due date for filing the federal return has been extended, provided
that, on or before the date for filing the annual return, the person notifies
the tax commissioner of the federal extension through the Ohio business
gateway.  An extension of time to file is not an extension of the time to pay
any tax due.
   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, a taxpayer subject
to the city’s tax on the net profit from a business or profession may file any
tax return or estimated tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to be
due on such returns, by using the Ohio business gateway.
      (1)   As used in this division, “qualifying wages” has the same meaning
as in Section 718.03 of the Ohio revised code.
      (2)   Any employer may report the amount of tax withheld from qualifying
wages paid on or after January 1, 2007, and may make remittance of such
amounts, by using the Ohio business gateway.
   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
   (Ord. 2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)
   191.2313  INTERNET SITE.
   The Administrator shall either establish an internet site or utilize the
site established by the Tax Commissioner pursuant to Section 5703.49 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  The Administrator shall post thereon rules and ordinances
governing the city’s income tax, including, but not limited to, ordinances or
rules governing the rate of tax; payment and withholding of taxes; filing any
prescribed returns, reports, or other documents; dates for filing or paying
taxes, including estimated taxes; penalties, interest, assessment, and other
collection remedies; rights of taxpayers to appeal; and procedures for filing
appeals.  The Administrator shall also make blanks of such returns, reports, or
documents, and any instructions pertaining thereto, available to the public
electronically through the internet.  If the Administrator establishes such an
internet site, the administrator shall incorporate an electronic link between
that site and the site established pursuant to Section 5703.49 of the Ohio
Revised Code, and shall provide to the Tax Commissioner the uniform resource
locator of the site.
(Ord. 2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)

of Council to be elected by that body, is hereby created.  The Board shall
select each year for a one year term one of its members to serve as chairman
and one to serve as secretary.  A majority of the members of the Board shall
constitute a quorum.  The Board shall adopt its own procedural rules and shall
keep a record of its transactions.  Any hearing by the Board may be conducted
privately and the provisions of Section
191.2309 hereof with reference to the confidential character of information
required to be disclosed by this chapter shall apply to such matters as may be
heard before the Board on appeal.

Administrator, and, at the request of the taxpayer or Administrator, is
empowered to substitute alternate methods of allocation.
(Ord.  2005-05.  Passed 3-8-05.)
   191.2503  RIGHT OF APPEAL.
   (a)   Any person dissatisfied with any ruling or decision of the
Administrator which is made under the authority conferred by this chapter may
appeal therefrom to the Board of Review within thirty days from the
announcement of such ruling or decision by the Administrator, Provided the
taxpayer making the appeal has filed with the city the required return or other
documents concerning the obligation at issue.  The appeal shall be in writing
and shall state why the decision should be deemed incorrect or unlawful.  The 
Board shall, on hearing, have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse or modify any
such ruling or decision or any part thereof.  Such hearing shall be scheduled
with 45 days from the date of appeal.  The Board’s ruling must be made within
30 days from the date of the closing of record, shall be in writing and filed
with the administrator, who within 15 days of its decision shall send notice of
its decision by ordinary mail to the taxpayer making the appeal.

division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the

successor entity.

failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute

withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be

      (5)    "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in this
state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned or
controlled by an employer.
      (6)    "Worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for more than
twenty days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not include the
home of an employee.
      (7)    "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
         (b)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Municipality. For the purposes of this division,
"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this state at which the employer provides services that can
reasonably be expected by the employer to last more than twenty days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than twenty days" if either of the following applies at the time the
services commence:
            (i)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
193.051 of this Chapter.
               (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
193.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
 193.051 of this Chapter.    
(Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.053  COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
   (A)    The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
section 3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales
agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section

   (C)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator
shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
      (2)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar

that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.

deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division.  The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)    The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. 
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;

amount is deducted and withheld. 
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.  (Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.06  INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
193.061  DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer. 
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
193.03(23). 
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
193.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
193.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
193.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)      (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
193.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
193.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located.  Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)     An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
 193.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)     If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
193.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. 
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.  (Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-

municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the revised code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (s)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code is
terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code is
binding upon the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury

federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
     
   (E)     (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
193.03 (1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for

      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of 193.03 of
this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
193.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so

purpose of making the computations required in Section
193.062  of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
193.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
193.062  of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file

continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division

   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

liability for the taxable year.  For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the

balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
193.091  of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and

estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year.  A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.

of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:

per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;

cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
193.091  of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that

of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors. (Ord.

193.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
193.081  CREDIT FOR INCOME TAXED BY ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   When the Municipal Taxable Income of a resident of the City of Independence
is subject to a municipal income tax in another municipality on the same income
taxable under this Chapter
193, such resident shall be allowed a credit equal to 100 percent of the amount
obtained by multiplying the lower of the tax rate of such other municipality or
of the City of Independence by the Municipal Taxable Income earned in or
attributable to the municipality of employment or business activity.  For
purposes of this Section
193.081, taxable income includes the portion of the distributive share of the
net profits of a resident owner of an unincorporated business entity, or a
resident recipient of distributions from a non-resident pass-through entity, to
the extent that these are included in a resident's Municipal Taxable Income in

plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.  (Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.083  CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
193.081 of this Chapter.  (Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.084  CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
193.096 of this Chapter. 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
193.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
193.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section
 193.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section, unless the provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the Municipality income tax
ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a tax return with the
Municipality for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(1)(g))
within the Municipality.
            (ii)   The person no longer provides services in the Municipality
and does not expect to be subject to the Municipality income tax for the
taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the Municipality.  The affidavit shall also
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the Municipality, make any sales in the Municipality, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the Municipality during the
taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
Municipality for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the Municipality income tax
ordinance and rules and regulations."  The person shall sign the affidavit
under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return for
the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.     
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
193.051  of this Chapter. 
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)     If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.  For
purposes of this section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the
taxpayer has designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be
the same date as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in section
193.051  of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld. 
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.  Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)   the Tax Administrator of the municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the municipality or tax
administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
193.052  of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.  The person shall provide the notice in a
signed affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including
the location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the
person performed services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. 
The affidavit also shall include the following statement:  "The affiant has no
plans to perform any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales
in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by
the municipal corporation during the taxable year.  If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a
taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by
the municipal corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
   (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of this
section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any tax
return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information
that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the
affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results in work
being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that results
in municipal taxable income reportable to the municipality in the taxable
year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year.  Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
      (Ord. 2018-111.  Passed 9-11-18.)

reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in

be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality  before the one hundred eighty-first day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.  (Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.093  USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)     Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)     The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law.  The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)     Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.  (Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.094  EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)     Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (B)     Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return.  If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)     An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)     If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return.  The extended due date of the
municipal income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the
state income tax return.  (Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.095  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
193.19 of this Chapter  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
193.19 of this Chapter  for filing the amended return even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
193.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  (Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.096    REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
               (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds
ten dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
193.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)     The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
193.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)     As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as

entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by

issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths; provided that the powers
referred to in this division of this section shall be exercised by the Tax

respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under a municipal corporation
income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this chapter;
   (B)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax

Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (I)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

      (Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.132    AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due. 
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized.  The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a  payment-over-time agreement.  (Ord.  2015-20. 
Passed 9-8-15.)
193.133  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.134  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information. 
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
193.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
 193.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
193.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
193.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
193.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.15    FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with  the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or  the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
               (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
193.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received
under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX  REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718. 
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and  may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code. 
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)     If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)     Members of the Local Board of Tax Review may receive
compensation, fees, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board if
Council so provides by a separate ordinance.
      (9)     A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing. 
(Ord.  2015-20.  Passed 9-8-15.)
193.19    ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
193.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
 193.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
193.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
193.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
          (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
          (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons

levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so

continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the

imposed against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of

the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or

violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

   313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
307.03  of the Traffic Code.  (ORC 4511.12)
   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

   313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
 313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent

subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the

person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by

to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this

available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender

under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the

program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the

under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the

court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.

may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing hours,
and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected; except,

fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by subsection (b)(4) hereof and on freeways, if the right-of-way line fence has
been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed by
subsection (b)(7) hereof.  The end of every school zone may be  marked by a

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.

limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit

4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class

have more than one valid license at any time. 
(ORC 4507.02)
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever

offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2)  of
this section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort
action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.  But the trier of
fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of
evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.     It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the
occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

operator or electric bicycle operator who violates any section of this Traffic
Code described in subsection (a) of this section that is applicable to bicycles
or electric bicycles may be issued a ticket, citation or summons by a law

offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
606.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is

General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

   606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
606.02.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.

following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
   606.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)    An officer, agent or employee of an organization may be prosecuted
for an offense committed by such organization if he acts with the kind of
culpability required for the commission of the offense and any of the following
applies:
      (1)    In the name of the organization or in its behalf he engages in
conduct constituting the offense or causes another to engage in such conduct or
tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
   606.10 FALSIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly make a false statement, or knowingly swear
or affirm the truth of a false statement previously made, when any of the
following applies:
      (1)   The statement is made in any official proceeding.
      (2)   The statement is made with purpose to incriminate another.
      (3)   The statement is made with purpose to mislead a public official in
performing the public official’s official function.
      (4)   The statement is made with purpose to secure the payment of

      (6)   The statement is sworn or affirmed before a notary public or
another person empowered to administer oaths.
      (7)   The statement is in writing on or in connection with a report or

offender, or to extend to or bestow upon the offender any other valuable
benefit or distinction, when the person to whom the statement is directed
relies upon it to that person’s detriment.
      (9)   The statement is made with purpose to commit or facilitate the
commission of a theft offense.
      (10)   The statement is knowingly made to a probate court in connection

      (11)   The statement is made on an account, form, record, stamp, label or
other writing that is required by law.
      (12)   The statement is made in a document or instrument of writing that
purports to be a judgment, lien, or claim of indebtedness and is filed or
recorded with the Secretary of State, a county recorder, or the clerk of a
court of record.
      (13)   The statement is required under Ohio R.C. 5743.71 in connection
with the person’s purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery
sale.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under subsection (a)(6) hereof that the
oath or affirmation was administered or taken in an irregular manner.
   (c)   If contradictory statements relating to the same fact are made by the
offender within the period of the statute of limitations for falsification, it
is not necessary for the prosecution to prove which statement was false, but
only that one or the other was false.
   (d)   (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsection (a)(1) to (8) or
(10) to (13) hereof is guilty of falsification, a misdemeanor of the first
degree.
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (a)(9) hereof is guilty of
falsification in a theft offense, a misdemeanor of the first degree.  If the
value of the property or services stolen is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or
more, falsification in a theft offense is a felony and shall be prosecuted
under appropriate State law. 
   (e)   A person who violates this section is liable in a civil action to any
person harmed by the violation for injury, death, or loss to person or property
incurred as a result of the commission of the offense and for reasonable

death, or loss to person or property as a result of a violation of this
section. (ORC 2921.13)

prosecution under subsection (b) hereof, the abandonment or agreement in no way
binds the State or Municipality to abandoning the prosecution.

      (2)   No person, knowing that a violation of division (B) of Ohio R.C.
2913.04 has been, or is being committed or that the person has received
information derived from such a violation, shall knowingly fail to report the

   (b)   Except for conditions that are within the scope of subsection (e) of
this section, no person giving aid to a sick or injured person shall
negligently fail to report to law enforcement authorities any gunshot or stab
wound treated or observed by the person, or any serious physical harm to
persons that the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe resulted from
an offense of violence.
   (c)   No person who discovers the body or acquires the first knowledge of
the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the
death is believed to have occurred, or knowledge concerning the death is
obtained.  For purposes of this subsection (c), “advanced practice registered
nurse” does not include a certified registered nurse anesthetist.
   (d)   No person shall fail to provide upon request of the person to whom a
report required by subsection (c) of this section was made, or to any law
enforcement officer who has reasonable cause to assert the authority to
investigate the circumstances surrounding the death, any facts within the

   (e)   (1)   As used in this subsection, “burn injury” means any of the

      (5)   Anyone participating in the making of reports under subsection (e)
of this section or anyone participating in a judicial proceeding resulting from
the reports is immune from any civil or criminal liability that otherwise might
be incurred or imposed as a result of such actions.  Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 
4731.22, the physician-patient relationship or advanced practice registered
nurse-patient relationship is not a ground for excluding evidence regarding a
person’s burn injury or the cause of the burn injury in any judicial proceeding
resulting from a report submitted under subsection (e) of this section.

for it in the patient’s or client’s records.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 4731.22, the physician-patient privilege

a communications assistant and those who are a party to a telecommunications
relay service call.
      (2)   The information would tend to incriminate a member of the actor’s
immediate family.
      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.
      (4)   Disclosure of the information would amount to disclosure by a
member of the ordained clergy of an organized religious body of a confidential
communication made to that member of the clergy in that member’s capacity as a
member of the clergy by a person seeking the aid or counsel of that member of
the clergy.
      (5)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of the actor’s duties in connection with a bona fide
program of treatment or services for drug dependent persons or persons in
danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider
whose alcohol and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to Ohio R.C.

violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.05 or to victims of felonious sexual
penetration in violation of former Ohio R.C. 2907.12.  As used in this
subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide
those services.
   (h)   No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to
any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.

606.21 was repealed as part of the 1990 updating and revision of these Codified
Ordinances. )
   606.22 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct which, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense which was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.

actor abandoned his effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented its
commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is

abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under

      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Section
606.21;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)    It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)    No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
606.22.
   (d)    If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court, when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
      "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of
his or her complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or
claimed complicity of a witness may affect his or her credibility and make his
or her testimony subject to grave suspicion and require that it be weighed with
great caution.
      It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)    It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)    Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were
the principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section or in terms of the principal offense.

   608.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the "Air Pollution Code of the City of
Independence, Ohio". (Ord. 1967-29. Passed 9-26-67.)
   608.02 DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the City to preserve,
protect and improve the air resources of the City in order to promote health,
safety and welfare, prevent injury to human health, plant and animal life and
property, foster the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants and, to the
greatest degree practicable, facilitate the enjoyment of the natural
attractions of the City.
   The emission or escape into the open air from any source or sources
whatsoever, of smoke, ashes, dust, dirt, grime, acids, fumes, gases, vapors,
odors or any other substances or combinations of substances, in such a manner
or in such amounts as to endanger or tend to endanger the health, comfort,
safety or welfare of the public, or which is unreasonably offensive and
objectionable to the public, or which causes unreasonable injury or damage to
property or which interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of property or
normal conduct of business, is hereby found and declared to be a public
nuisance. No person shall cause, permit or maintain any such public nuisance.
(Ord. 1972-47. Passed 5-23-72.)
   608.03 DEFINITIONS.

particulate matter, or any combination thereof present in the atmosphere.
   (b)    "Air pollution" means the presence in the outdoor atmosphere of one
or more air contaminants or any combination thereof in sufficient quantities
and of such characteristics and duration which are injurious or are likely to
be injurious to public welfare, to the health of human, plant or animal life or
to property, or which unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of life and
property.
   (c)    "Control equipment" means any equipment which has the function of
controlling the emissions from a process, fuel-burning, or refuse-burning
equipment and thus reduces the creation of, or the emission of air contaminants
into the atmosphere, or both.

   608.05 REPORTING OF INFORMATION.
   (a)    Persons engaged in operations which may result in air pollution
shall, if so required, file with the Service Department reports containing
information as to:
      (1)    Location and description of source;
      (2)    Rate, duration and composition of contaminant emission; and
      (3)    Such other information as the Department may require.
         (Ord. 1967-29. Passed 9-26-67.)
   (b)    Whoever violates or fails to comply with this section is guilty of a
minor misdemeanor for a first offense and a misdemeanor of the third degree for
each subsequent offense. Punishment shall be as provided in Section
698.02. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation occurs or continues.
   608.06 INSPECTIONS.
   (a)    Any duly authorized officer, employee or representative of the
Department may enter and inspect any property, premises or place at any
reasonable time for the purpose of investigating or testing either an actual or
suspected source of air pollution, or of ascertaining the state of compliance
with this chapter and regulations enforced pursuant thereto. No person shall
refuse entry or access to any authorized representative of the Service
Department who requests entry for the aforementioned purposes, and who presents
appropriate credentials; nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere
with any such inspection.
(Ord. 1967-29. Passed 9-26-67.)
   (b)    Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor for a
first offense and a misdemeanor of the third degree for any subsequent offense.
Punishment shall be as provided in Section
698.02. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation occurs or continues.
   608.07 EMISSIONS PROHIBITED.
   (a)    Visible Emissions. A person shall not discharge into the outdoor
atmosphere from any single source of emission whatsoever any air contaminant,
exclusive of water vapor, which is:
      (1)    Darker in shade than that designated as No. 1 on the Ringelmann
Smoke Chart; or
      (2)    Of such opacity as to obscure an observer's view to a degree
greater than does smoke designated as No. 1 on the Ringelmann Smoke Chart;
provided, however, that if an emission of air contaminants contains less than
0.10 pounds of particulate matter per 1,000 pounds of dry exhaust gas, adjusted
to twelve percent carbon dioxide (or fifty percent excess air) for fuel burning
equipment or incinerators, this limitation shall not apply.
   (b)    Emissions of Particulate Matter.
      (1)    No person shall cause, suffer or allow to be emitted into the
outdoor atmosphere from any fuel-burning equipment or to pass a convenient
measuring point near the stack outlet, particulate matter in the flue gases to
exceed 0.60 pounds per 1,000,000 BTU heat input for installations using less
than ten million BTU per hour total input. For installations using greater than
ten million BTU per hour total input, Figure 1 (which is attached hereto and
incorporated herein by reference) will be used to determine the allowable
particulate emission limitation.
      (2)    The burning of refuse in fuel-burning equipment is prohibited
except in equipment from which no visible emissions in excess of that permitted
by subsection (a) of this section and no particulate matter in excess of that
permitted by subsection (b) of this section are emitted, and no odors arising
from the installation are observable beyond the premises on which the
installation is located.
      (3)    No person shall cause, suffer or allow to be emitted into the
outdoor atmosphere from any incinerator, or to pass a convenient measuring
point near the stack outlet, particulate matter:
         A.    To exceed 0.65 pounds per 1,000 pounds of the flue gas, adjusted
to twelve percent carbon dioxide, or fifty percent excess air, and calculated
as if no auxiliary fuel had been used, for incinerators designed for burning up
to 200 pounds of refuse per hour; or
         B.    To exceed 0.30 pounds per 1,000 pounds of flue gas, adjusted to
twelve percent carbon dioxide, or fifty percent excess air, and calculated as
if no auxiliary fuel had been used, for incinerators designed for burning 200
or more pounds of refuse per hour.
         In no case shall the total discharge of particulate matter in any one
hour exceed 250 pounds.
      (4)    The maximum allowable emission of particulate matter from any
source whatever except fuel-burning equipment and incinerators shall be
determined from Table 1 (which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by
reference). Where the process weight per hour falls between two values in the
Table, the maximum weight discharged per hour shall be determined by linear
interpolation. When the process weight is in excess of 60,000 pounds per hour,
there shall not be discharged in any one hour from any source whatsoever
particulate matter in excess of 0.066 percent of the process weight per hour.
      (5)    Stack emission tests for particulate matter shall be undertaken by
generally recognized standards or methods of measurement. Methods found in the
"A.S.M.E. Test Code for Dust Separating Apparatus, PTC 21-1957", and the "Los
Angeles County Source Testing Manual" shall be used, but these may be modified
or adjusted by the Director to suit specific sampling conditions or needs based
upon good practice, judgment and experience.
         (Ord. 1968-26. Passed 10-8-68.)
      (6)    No person shall cause or permit any materials to be handled,
processed, transported or stored in a manner which allows or may allow
particulate matter to escape and become airborne beyond his property line in
sufficient quantities as to constitute air pollution or an air pollution
nuisance. Airborne particulate matter at such property line or beyond such
property line within reasonable proximity thereto in the amount of 300
micrograms per cubic meter is hereby declared to constitute impermissible air
pollution and a public nuisance.
         (Ord. 1972-47. Passed 5-23-72.)
   (c)    Emissions of Gases, Vapors and Odors.
      (1)    No person shall cause, suffer or allow any emissions of gases,
vapors or odors beyond the property line from which such emissions occur to be
in sufficient quantities and of such characteristics and duration as if or is
likely to be injurious to the public welfare, to the health of human, plant or
animal life, or to property or which interferes with the enjoyment of life and
property.
      (2)    No person shall permit or allow emissions into the surrounding air
of sulfur oxides from the use of fuels greater than the sulfur oxide emissions
that would be produced by fuels with an average sulfur content of two percent
by weight, when used under similar conditions but without any treatment of the
exhausts from such use.
      (3)    In the absence of appropriate control measures, no person shall
use products which, either by themselves or due to additives or impurities,
result in air pollution.
   (d)    Open Burning. Except as noted below, no person shall kindle an open
fire in any public or private place outside any building. Fires started in
violation of this chapter shall be promptly extinguished by the persons
responsible for same upon notice by the Service Director or his duly designated
agent. During the existence of an air pollution alert, as may be declared by
the Director, all exceptions are void and no open fires shall be kindled.
      (1)    Open burning may be done under permit as follows:
         A.    Application for burning permits shall be on forms provided by
the Department.
         B.    No permit shall be issued unless the issuing officer is
satisfied that:
            1.    There is no practical available alternate method for the
disposal of the material to be burned;
            2.    No hazardous condition will be created by such burning;
            3.    No salvage operation by open burning will be conducted; and
            4.    No leaves will be burned in those areas where provision is
made for public collection thereof.
         C.    If it becomes apparent at any time to the Service Director that
limitations need to be imposed for any of the reasons stated in subdivision B.
above, the Service Director or his duly designated agent shall notify the
permittee and any limitations so imposed shall be treated as conditions under
which the permit is issued.
      (2)    Open burning may be done without permit as follows:
         A.    In those areas where provision for public collection of leaves
is not made, the open burning of leaves is permitted provided that materials
which create dense smoke (emissions of an opacity or darkness greater than No.
2 on the Ringelmann Chart) or emissions injurious or noxious to people or
property are not burned.
         B.    Open fires may be set in performance of an official duty of any
public officer if the fire is necessary for one or more of the following
reasons or purposes:
            1.    For the prevention of a fire hazard which cannot be abated by
other means;
            2.    For the instruction of public fire fighters or industrial
employees under supervision of the Chief of the Fire Department; and
            3.    For the protection of public health.
         C.    Fires may be used for the cooking of food provided no smoke
violation or other nuisance is created.
         D.    Salamanders or other devices may be used for heating by
construction or other workers provided no smoke violation or other nuisance is
created.
         E.    Fires may be set in the course of agricultural operations in
growing crops or raising fowl or animals provided no nuisance is created.
         F.    Open fires may be set for recreational purposes, such as
campfires, provided no smoke violation or nuisance is created.
   (e)    Operation of Equipment.
      (1)    General. Any equipment that may produce air contaminants shall not
be operated or maintained in such a manner that a nuisance is created, Nothing
in any section of this chapter relating to regulation of emission of air
contaminants shall in any manner be construed as authorizing or permitting the
creation or maintenance of a nuisance.
      (2)    Motor vehicles.
         A.    No person operating or having control of a vehicle shall permit
the engine of such vehicle to operate for more than three minutes while such
vehicle is stationary except when the local temperature as reported by the U.
S. Weather Bureau is below thirty-five degrees Fahrenheit.
         B.    The engine, power and exhaust mechanism of every motor vehicle
shall be so equipped, adjusted and operated as to prevent the escape therefrom
of excessive fumes or smoke.
   (f)    Malfunction of Equipment. Emissions exceeding any of the limits
established in this section as a direct result of unusual conditions in or
malfunction of any incinerator or any process, fuel-burning, or control
equipment or related operating equipment beyond the control of the person
owning or operating such equipment shall not be deemed to be in violation of
this section, provided that the owner or operator advises the Department within
twenty-four hours of the circumstances and outlines a corrective and preventive
program acceptable to the Department.
   (g)    Circumvention Clause. No person shall build, erect, install or use
any article, equipment or other contrivance the sole purpose of which is to
dilute or conceal an emission without resulting in a reduction in the total
release of air contaminants into the atmosphere.
   (h)    Nonapplicability. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to
emissions from fuel-burning equipment or incinerators installed in single-
family or two-family dwellings and not used for any commercial purpose.
(Ord. 1968-26. Passed 10-8-68.)
   (i)    Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of
this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor for a first offense and a
misdemeanor of the third degree for any subsequent offense. Punishment shall be
as provided in Section
698.02. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation occurs or continues.
   608.08 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    Whenever the Department has reason to believe that a violation of any
provision of this chapter or a rule or regulation issued pursuant thereto has
occurred, it may cause written notice to be served upon the alleged violator or
violators. The notice shall specify the provision of the chapter, rule or
regulation alleged to be violated, and the facts alleged to constitute a
violation thereof, and may order that the necessary corrective action be taken
within a reasonable time. Any such order shall become final unless, no later
than five days after the date such order is served, the person or persons named
therein request in writing a hearing before the Department. In lieu of such
order the Department may require that the alleged violator or violators appear
before the Department for a hearing at a time and place specified in the
notice, to answer the charges complained of, or the Department may initiate
appropriate action for the recovery of penalties pursuant to Section
608.05(b), 608.06(b) or 608.07(i).
   (b)    After such hearing the Department shall affirm, modify or rescind its
order or issue an appropriate order or orders for the prevention, abatement or
control of the air pollution involved. Such order shall prescribe the date or
dates by which the violation or violations shall cease and may prescribe
timetables for necessary action in preventing, abating or controlling the air
pollution.
   (c)    Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the Department from making
efforts to obtain voluntary compliance through warning, conference or any other
appropriate means. (Ord. 1967-29. Passed 9-26-67.)
   608.09 EMERGENCY PROCEDURE.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter or any other provision of
law, if the Department finds that any person is causing or contributing to air
pollution and that such pollution creates an emergency which requires immediate
action to protect the public health or safety, the Service Director shall order
such person to reduce or discontinue immediately the air pollution and such
order shall be complied with immediately. Upon issuance of any such order, the
Service Director, if requested by the person so ordered, shall fix a time and
place for a hearing before the Department, such hearing to be held within a
reasonable time thereafter. Not more than twenty-four hours after the
conclusion of such a hearing, and without adjournment thereof, the order shall
be affirmed, modified or set aside.
(Ord. 1967-29. Passed 9-26-67.)
   608.10 EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)    Any person responsible for any source of air contaminant may apply to
the Department for an exemption or partial exemption from the provisions of
Section
608.07. The application shall be accompanied by such information and data as
the Department may require. The Department may grant such exemption or partial
exemption if it finds that:
      (1)    The discharges occurring or proposed to occur do not constitute a
danger to public health or safety; and
      (2)    Compliance with the provisions of Section
608.07 from which exemption is sought would produce serious hardship without
equal or greater benefits to the public.
   (b)    In connection with the requirement of Ringelmann No. 1 (smoke density
reading on the Ringelmann Chart), exemptions will normally be granted provided
that the temporary emission shall not exceed Ringelmann No. 2 for a period of
three minutes in an hour, unless the Department finds that undue hardship to
the applicant will not result from denial of the exemption.
   (c)    No exemption or partial exemption shall be granted pursuant to this
section except after public hearing on due notice and until the Department has
considered the relative interests of the applicant, other owners of property
likely to be affected by the discharges and the general public.
   (d)    No exemption or partial exemption issued pursuant to this section
shall be granted for a period to exceed one year, but any such exemption or
partial exemption may be renewed for like periods if no complaint is made to
the Department on account thereof or if, after such complaint has been made and
duly considered at a public hearing held by the Department on due notice, the
Department finds that renewal is justified. No renewal shall be granted except
on application therefor. Any such application shall be made at least sixty days
prior to the expiration of the exemption or partial exemption. Immediately
prior to making his application for renewal the applicant shall give public
notice of such application in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
Department. Any renewal granted pursuant to this subsection shall be on the
same grounds and subject to the same limitations and requirements as provided
in subsection (a) of this section.
   (e)    An exemption, partial exemption or renewal thereof shall not be a
right of the applicant or holder thereof but shall be in the discretion of the
Department.
   (f)    Nothing in this section and no exemption, partial exemption or
renewal granted pursuant hereto shall be construed to prevent or limit the
application of the emergency provisions and procedures of Section
608.09 to any person or his property.
(Ord. 1967-29. Passed 9-26-67.)
   608.11 ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW.
   Any person aggrieved by any order of the Department may have administrative
review thereof by appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 1967-29. Passed 9-26-67.)
   608.12 CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS.
   Any records or other information which relate to processes or production
unique to the owner or operator or which would tend to affect adversely the
competitive position of such owner or operator shall be only for the
confidential use of the Department and other departments, agencies and officers
of the City, unless such owner or operator shall expressly agree to their
publication or availability to the general public. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prevent the use of such records or information by any department,
agency or officer of the City in compiling or publishing analysis or summaries
relating to the general condition of the outdoor atmosphere, provided that such
analyses or summaries do not reveal any information otherwise confidential
under this section.
(Ord. 1967-29. Passed 9-26-67.)
   608.13 FEES.
   A nonrefundable fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be paid
simultaneously with the submission of an application for any exemption or
renewal pursuant to Section
608.10. (Ord. 1967-29. Passed 9-26-67.)
   608.14 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This chapter shall become effective immediately upon its enactment provided
that persons owning or using existing equipment or fuels not in conformance
with the requirements set forth in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (e) of Section
608.07 shall, on or before May 26, 1968, comply or apply for an exemption under
the provisions of Section
608.10.
(Ord. 1968-7. Passed 3-12-68.)
   608.15 EQUITABLE REMEDIES.
   (a)    Action pursuant to Section

shall be kept clean and sanitary.  Receptacles shall be used to store food and
shall be kept securely covered.  The owner/custodian shall ensure that each
animal receives sufficient food.
      (2)   Proper water.  All animals shall have available clean and fresh
drinkable water.  Animals which are being worked or transported shall be
provided water as often as necessary for their health and comfort.  All water
receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary, be of appropriate design and size
for the animal, and be positioned or affixed to prevent spillage.
      (3)   Proper space. 
         A.   Animals shall be able to stand to their full height, stretch out,
turn around, and lie down in areas which are both clean and sanitary, and which
allow for a free flow of fresh air.
         B.   Animals shall be allowed to exercise and have the freedom of
movement as necessary to reduce stress and maintain good physical condition. 
Said space shall be kept free of standing water, mud, accumulated waste and
debris.
         C.   Dogs and cats shall not be caged except for transport, temporary
confinement or as prescribed by a veterinarian.  Dogs and cats kept in cages
for the aforementioned reasons shall be removed and exercised so as to maintain
proper health.  Cats shall be provided with litter pans and litter material
which shall be changed as necessary to prevent odor and accumulation of urine
and fecal matter.
         D.   Small caged animals and rodents, rats and mice, shall be

         F.   Dogs continuously maintained on a restrictive chain, rope or
other kind or tether shall be deemed to be improperly confined.  Tethering may

off the tether has been afforded and verified.  If a dog is confined on a
tether, excepting periods of time that are brief and incidental, the tether
shall be at least 15 feet in length and positioned to prevent tangling and
hanging.  The tether must be of proper weight for the size of the dog to be
tethered and to allow for the provisions set forth in this section.  Logging

         A.   Indoor facilities shall be adequately ventilated by natural or
mechanical means to prevent extreme temperatures, provide fresh air and
minimize drafts, odors and moisture.

sides, a doorway, and solid, level floor raised at least two inches from the
ground.  The doorway shall be positioned away from the prevailing winds.

domestic animals who exhibit signs of diseased or severe parasitic infestation,
infection, orificial discharge, loss of appetite, weight loss, abnormal skin
condition or hair loss, tremors, seizures, temperature fluctuation, inability
to bear weight on a limb or lameness, or any other sign of illness or injury
shall provide veterinary care for said animal.
      (7)   Proper grooming.  Hair or fur of an animal shall be clean and
properly maintained as to prevent tangles, matting and debris, insect
infestation, or skin disorders.  Nails or hooves of animal shall be properly
trimmed.

unnecessary suffering, cruelty or neglect.  Unnecessary suffering, cruelty and
neglect may be defined as, but is not limited to, failing to provide an animal
with any of the aforementioned animal care standards.

cruelty or neglect is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, and shall be
subject to the penalty provided in Section
698.02.  In addition, the court may order the animal offender to forfeit the
animal or livestock and may provide for its disposition, including but not
limited to the sale of the animal.  If an animal or livestock is forfeited and
sold pursuant to this subsection, the proceeds of such sale first shall be
applied to pay the expenses incurred with regard to the care of the animal from
the time it was taken from the custody of the former owner.  The balance of the
proceeds, if any, shall be paid to the former owner of the animal.

manner to insure using first those of appropriate grades and kinds that have
been longest in storage.
      (14)    Packages of explosives shall not be opened at any point less than
fifty feet distant from any magazine. No tools except wooden, and wooden, fibre
or rubber mallets shall be used for opening packages of explosives except that
nonferrous slitters may be used for opening fibre board containers, provided
such slitters cannot come within range of metallic case fasteners.
      (15)    Doors.
         A.    Doors of all Class A magazines shall be equipped with two
mortise locks, with two padlocks fastened in separate clasps and staples, with
a combination of a mortise lock and a padlock, with a mortise lock that
requires two keys to open or with a three- point lock. Padlocks and mortise
locks shall be the equivalent of a five tumbler jar-proof lock.

      (20)    Temporary retention underground. Small quantities of explosives
resulting from over estimate of the amount necessary for the blast may be
temporarily retained underground until after the blast but only if placed in a
limited capacity daily supply magazine situated at a safe distance from the
tunnel face. Detonators shall not be placed in the same receptacle with other
explosives.
   (i)    Use.
      (1)    Blasting operations shall be carried on with the smallest possible
number of persons present.
      (2)    The diameter of explosives cartridges shall be of an appropriate
size to permit charging drill holes throughout their lengths without either
forcing or ramming explosives.
      (3)    Explosives should not be removed from the original wrapper before
being loaded into bore holes except when irregularities of the hole make it
impossible to load whole cartridges with safety or in block holing where small
charges are desirable. This rule shall not apply to free running explosives.
      (4)    Excessive ramming should be avoided in loading or tamping
explosives in a bore hole. In tamping only wooden tools of suitable diameter
with squarecut ends and without exposed metal parts shall be used. Plastic pipe
with a wooden plug at the end should be used for long, small diameter holes.
When a tamping stick is used in charging drill holes, the force of impact shall
be insufficient to penetrate explosive cartridges. Primed cartridges shall not
be tamped.
      (5)    No activity of a continuous nature, nor more than two men engaged
in intermittent work, shall be permitted in front of a face being loaded with
explosives and within the probable range of flying material in the case of a
premature blast:
         A.    When steam equipment is being employed; or
         B.    When primers containing electric blasting caps are employed the
probable range of flying material shall be considered to be not less than 100
feet to one and one-half times the height of the face of the rock cut whichever
is greater provided that end clearance may be reduced by one-half.
      (6)    When loading free running or bulk explosives, a bronze, wooden or
heavy paper funnel shall be used unless the explosives can be poured directly
from a container into the hole in such a manner as to prevent scattering of
loose explosives around the collar of the hole. The use of mechanical or
pneumatic methods of loading shall be prohibited.
      (7)    Primers shall not be made up until just prior to loading into the
hole.
         A.    Electric blasting caps used in churn drill holes or any small
bore holes shall always be tested with a blasting galvanometer before any
stemming is placed in the hole, and also during loading whenever any question
arises as to the condition of the leg wires. The leg wires shall be short
circuited after testing and shall remain so until they are connected with the
circuit.
         B.    In short length small diameter bore holes containing only one
electric blasting cap the leg-wire shunt shall be left in place until
connection is made either into the completed circuit or the leading wires are
coiled near the blasting area and shunted at the power connection circuit or
the leading wires are coiled near the blasting area and shunted at the power
connection end. Leading wires shall always be in the blaster's possession,
uncoiled or strung toward the power source, not grounded and before connection
is made the circuit shall be tested with a blasting galvanometer. If the
circuit is defective the leading wires shall be reshunted and recoiled to the
blasting area before investigating for the trouble. If a defective cap or leg-
wire occurs in a bore hole the stemming shall be removed by compressed air or a
water jet and a new primer inserted.
         C.    In any single series and in the same blast, electric blasting
caps shall be the same brand.
      (8)    No blast shall be fired until the rock or other substances to be
loosened or shattered has been covered with strong woven matting of rope or
wire and a number of heavy logs or timbers securely tied together by chains or
cables or sufficient weight to prevent the scattering of the loosened or
shattered material. Displacement of such matting due to detonation shall be
kept to a minimum. Extreme care shall be exercised at all times to prevent rock
slides due to excessive vibration. The provisions herein may be waived by the
Municipal Engineer when in his opinion the use of matting is unnecessary. (Ord.
1968-5. Passed 2-27-68.)
      (9)    Blasts shall only be fired electrically with either a power
circuit or blasting machine excepting that individual holes may be initiated
with electrical firing devices or detonating fuses. The method of fire shall at
all times be maintained in good operating condition. The efficiency of the
blasting machine shall be tested periodically to make certain that it can
deliver power at its rated capacity. The power circuit shall be energized by
not less than 200 volts nor more than 500 volts. For alternating current, not
less than forty cycles per second shall be used.
      (10)    When firing from a power circuit, sufficient power shall be
provided to supply ample current and voltage requirements for each blast. When
firing with a blasting machine, it shall be used for series or parallel series
circuits and be approved therefor. The explosives manufacturer's instructions
shall be followed for all electric blasting regardless of source of power.
      (11)    The power wires, leading wires and connecting wires shall be
thoroughly insulated and kept from contact with any electrical conductor, air
lines or pools of water or oil.
      (12)    The leg wires of detonators shall be kept short circuited until
connected into either the circuit or to the shunted leading wires. All bare
connections shall be either taped or blocked up in position so as to prevent
current leakage or entrance of stray or active currents. While making
connections in the blast area the leading wires shall be kept short circuited
at the power source end but not grounded and shall remain in the possession of
the blaster. The leading wires shall then be strung from the blast area toward
the source of power to make the final connections to fire the blast. Before
connecting the leading wires to the power circuit, the blaster shall make
certain by a blasting galvanometer test that an unsafe difference in potential
does not exist between the two wires of a blasting line. If this test shows
either a short circuit or no circuit, the reshunted leading wires shall be
recoiled to the blast area before investigating for the trouble.
      (13)    Positive steps shall be taken to prevent lead wires from being
dislodged and making contact with overhead high voltage electric power lines.
Should accidental contact be made, the blaster shall prevent any person from
touching the blasting device and he shall immediately clear the area of all
persons. No person shall enter the area until the blaster has notified the
owner of the power line and the latter has eliminated the danger of electric
shock.
      (14)    A power circuit used for firing shall be controlled by a switch
located at a safe distance to be determined by the blaster but not less than
150 feet from the blast area. Such switch when in actual use shall be firmly
fastened in position, thoroughly insulated against grounds and wholly enclosed
in a tight box that shall be kept closed and locked at all times except while
firing. No person other than the blaster shall have access to the switch. The
switch shall be provided with a short circuit in the "off" position and shall
be so arranged that the box enclosure can be locked only when the switch is in
the "off" position.
      (15)    When firing by means of a power circuit the blasting circuit
shall at all times be broken in at least one place by a gap of at least five
feet on the incoming side of the switch, except during the firing operation.
      (16)    When firing with a blasting machine, it shall be located not less
than 150 feet from the blast area.
      (17)    When firing by means of a blasting machine, the leading wires
shall be kept short circuited until the shot is ready for firing and shall not
be connected to the blasting machine until immediately before the time of
firing and shall be disconnected from the blasting machine and short circuited
immediately after firing.
      (18)    Electric detonators and blasting circuits shall be tested only by
means of a blasting galvanometer designed for this purpose.
      (19)    Required warnings.
         A.   (1)   Before firing any blast all means of access to the danger
zone, the extent of which shall be determined by the blaster, shall be
effectively guarded to exclude all unauthorized personnel.  At least one
minute, but not more than two minutes before the detonation of a blast, the
blaster in charge, or someone directed by the blaster, shall give an audible
warning signal.  If the blast is not detonated within two minutes of the
audible warning signal, the warning signal shall be repeated as required by
this paragraph before the blast is detonated.  Upon the sounding of the warning
signal, all persons shall retire to a safe shelter.  No blast shall be fired
while any person is in the danger zone.  After the blast has been detonated and
the blaster has determined that the blast area is safe to re-enter, an audible
all-clear signal shall be given. Warning and all-clear signals shall be
different in character and audible within one-quarter mile of the blasting
site.
            (2)   The blaster shall use standard warning and all-clear signals
to be produced by an air horn or similar device.  The warning signal, to be
sounded one to two minutes before the blast, shall consist of three long
reports, each lasting at least five seconds.  The all-clear signal shall
consist of one long report lasting at least five seconds.
               (Ord. 1999-31.  Passed 10-12-99.)
         B.    It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to safeguard
pedestrians and other highway users and their vehicles from injury or damage
due to blasting operations. When the blast area is within 300 feet of a
highway, the blaster, just prior to the blast shall designate a sufficient
number of employees of the contractor, each carrying an approved red warning
flag or sign, to stop all vehicular and pedestrian traffic on each possible
route of travel in the vicinity of the blast area until the blast has been
fired. Qualified employees shall be dispatched to predetermined points on the
highways to prevent vehicles from entering the danger zone. A check shall be
made of the highways in the danger zone to insure that there are no parked
vehicles or pedestrians who would be endangered by the blast.
      (20)    When the floor of a rock cut is more than five feet below the
average grade of a public highway at any point within 100 feet of such highway,
an effective and approved barrier shall be erected by the contractor along the
property line nearest the highway for an approved distance to provide
protection against the drop or fall on vehicles or persons.
      (21)    Immediately following the blast the area shall be examined by the
blaster for evidence of misfired charges. If such is found, the blaster shall
provide proper safeguards for excluding all personnel from the danger zone
except minimum personnel which, in the opinion of the blaster are required to
remove the misfire.
      (22)    All misfires shall be reported at once to the superintendent who
shall then determine the safe and proper method of disposal. Each misfire
presents an individual problem which shall be placed under the supervision of a
person thoroughly competent to handle such matters. The unexploded charge shall
be detonated if such can be accomplished without risk of injury to personnel.
If repriming is necessary any stemming present in the hole may be removed by a
jet of water or air. In cases where competent supervision is not available
locally, the explosives manufacturer shall be consulted as to availability
thereof.
      (23)    Drilling in any hole that is known to contain or have contained
explosives is prohibited until satisfactory neutralization is effected.
      (24)    A complete record shall be kept showing all misfires, their
courses and method of disposal. Copies shall be furnished to the Chief of
Police within one day.
      (25)    In case of a sprung hole or where a charge fires but does not
bring down the burden, it is permissible to reload the bore hole if in suitable
condition to perform its functions and only after the temperature of the hole
has been reduced by water or otherwise to not more than 150 degrees F. (Ord.
1968-3.  Passed 1-12-68.)
      (26)    Stemming.
         A.    Each blast hole shall be stemmed to the collar or be high enough
to provide efficient confinement of the charge and to minimize the chance of
injury to personnel and adjoining property from flying material.
         B.    For toe holes the collar stemming shall in no case be less than
one-third the depth of the hole. (Ord. 1999-31. Passed 10-12-99.)
      (27)    Block holes shall contain at least eighty- five percent of
stemming material.
      (28)    There shall be compliance with the following requirements to
eliminate the hazards of radio-frequency energy in connection with the use of
electric blasting caps.
         A.    Irrespective of ownership mobile transmitting stations with
outputs up to thirty watts such as those of the portable type or installed in
automobiles shall be kept at least 100 feet away from any electric blasting cap
except when in original containers. Users of such stations shall be notified by
the contractor and such users shall comply with the requirements of this
subparagraph.
         B.    When such radio transmitters are less than 100 feet away from
electric blasting caps in other than original containers they shall be de-
energized and should be effectively locked.
         C.    When electric blasting caps are transported in a motor vehicle
equipped with a radio transmitter, they shall either be in their original
package or stored in a closed metal box that is lined with a cushioning
material such as wood or sponge rubber. When the electric blasting caps are
being placed into or removed from the box, the transmitter circuit shall be
disconnected.
         D.    All blasting operations shall be conducted at no less distance
from any fixed or mobile radio transmitter than indicated in the following
table:
 
 
Transmitter power output (watts) Minimum distance from blasting operations
                                 using electric blasting caps (feet)

250 - 500                        450
500 - 1,000                      650
1,000 - 2,500                    1,000
2,500 - 5,000                    1,500
5,000 - 10,000                   2,200
10,000 - 25,000                  3,500
25,000 - 50,000                  5,000
50,000 - 100,000                 7,000
 
         E.    When it can be demonstrated by means of approved tests that
electric blasting may be carried out at lesser distances from the transmitter
than required by the table shown in subsection (i)(28)D. hereof, the Service
Director may allow a variation from the requirements of such table.
      (29)    Short period delay firing shall be used when necessary to comply
with the requirements of Section
620.09.
      (30)    Transportation from surface. The supply of explosives shall be
transported from the magazine on the surface without interruption directly to
the heading of the tunnel and no person except the attendant shall ride with
the supply of explosives.
      (31)    Transportation on cage, skip or bucket. Detonators and other
explosives shall not be transported at the same time on the cage, skip or
bucket.
      (32)    Distribution underground. Where cars are necessary separate
insulated containers or compartments in the same car shall be provided for
carrying detonators apart from other explosives underground. Such cars shall be
painted red and clearly labeled as to contents. Receptacles specially designed
for the purpose and having a capacity not in excess of fifty pounds shall be
used for carrying explosives to the face. The amount of explosives carried to
the face shall not exceed the amount estimated to be necessary for the blast.
      (33)    Primers. Primers shall be made up near the face at special
benches provided for the purpose. They must be kept in insulated carriers or
containers separate from other explosives at all times until placed in bore
holes. Primers shall be made up immediately prior to their use in the blast and
the number of such primers shall not be more than is necessary for such blast.
   (j)    Primary Blasting.
      (1)    While explosives are being loaded in bore holes, the blaster shall
keep all persons not necessary for the blasting operation away from the blast
area.
      (2)    When loading a blast primed with electric detonators, explosives
shall not be transported into the blast area until all electric power circuits
have first been disconnected to a point not less than 100 feet from the blast
area.
      (3)    When drilling and loading are being performed simultaneously in
the same general area, the two operations shall be separated as widely as
practicable and in no case shall drilling be conducted closer to a loaded hole
or a hole that is being loaded than a distance equal to the deepest blast hole
in the area, and in no case less than fifty feet. Loading and drilling
operations shall not be permitted or allowed underground in the same general
working area.
      (4)    Holes shall be checked prior to loading to determine depth and
condition. After any explosives have been loaded all measuring shall be done
with a cloth tape, nonferrous measuring device and lead plumb bob or a wooden
tamping pole or wooden dolly free of exposed metal parts, as appropriate for
vertical holes.
      (5)    Loading of explosives, amount in blast area.
         A.    Under no circumstances shall the amount of explosives taken into
a blast area exceed the amount estimated by the blaster as necessary for the
blast. Such explosives shall be stacked in piles at least twenty-five feet from
the nearest holes being loaded or as far as the width of the bench or floor
permits, and at such distances apart that any premature explosion will not be
likely to propagate from one pile to another, as provided in subsection (j)
(5)C. herein.
         B.    The explosives containers, if any, shall be opened at the pile
and carried up to the hole one case or unit at a time for immediate loading or
placed at a loading station not less than six feet from the hole except that
not more than 100 pounds of explosives shall be allowed at the loading station
at any one time.
         C.    Explosives shall be distributed in such a manner that the
distances from storage piles to the allowable maximum quantity of 100 pounds of
explosives at the loading station or between such 100 pound loading station
piles shall not be less than the quantities shown in the following quantity
distance table:

5,000                96
10,000               123
            Note: Interpolation is permitted.
      (6)    Blasting operations shall be carried on with the smallest
practical number of persons present and no one but authorized personnel shall
be allowed in or near the blast area.
      (7)    Drill holes shall not be sprung when they are less than 100 feet
from the nearest hole containing explosives. Holes that have been sprung shall
not be charged with explosives until the maximum temperature in any portion of
such holes has been reduced to 150 degrees F. Where practical the use of water
is recommended for cooling purposes.
      (8)    When loading a blast primed with detonating fuse, the detonator or
detonators required for firing the blast shall not be brought into the blast
area not attached to the detonating fuse until all persons except the blaster
and his assistants, have been cleared from the danger zone and retreated to a
safe distance or to a place of safe shelter.
      (9)    In all primary blasting and all other blasting where the firing of
any one hole is likely to break into or damage another hole in the vicinity or
where the firing of any hole may propagate the charge in a loaded hole in the
vicinity, all holes which have been loaded shall be included and fired in the
blast.
      (10)    All holes for blasting shall be checked before attempting to load
explosives. Blast holes may be checked with a dolly or tamping block or by
visual inspection with the aid of a mirror.
      (11)    Water standing in blast holes should be bailed out if possible
and the holes shall be loaded with an explosives water resistance.
      (12)    Blasting crews shall consist of the minimum number of experienced
men to do the work in an efficient manner, and should be organized carefully
with each man assigned to definite tasks in order to avoid confusion.
      (13)    Loading chart for primary blasting.
         A.    A blast shall be planned before loading is started. The planned
charge for each hole shall be recorded.
         B.    The condition of each hole to be loaded and the amount, height
and position of the explosives charge or charges placed in the hole shall be
recorded on the loading chart.
      (14)    Members of loading crews engaged in loading blast holes should be
prohibited from wearing hobnail or steel-plated shoes to avoid striking sparks
on rocks.
      (15)    Large dynamite cartridges may be dropped in blast holes only when
the hole is free from obstructions to the depth at which the cartridge is to
rest.
      (16)    Large dynamite cartridges shall not be dropped in blast holes
containing excessive water until the charge is above the water level.
      (17)    Large dynamite cartridges that have been wedged in a blast hole
shall not be tamped. After pouring water into the hole, attempts to dislodge or
pierce them shall be made with a spear-shaped wooden tamping block or a small
diameter wooden pole.
      (18)    Rough or ragged holes and holes partly closed by an obstruction
that cannot be readily removed shall be loaded with cartridged dynamite lowered
with a rope, with free running powder, or with dynamite cut in small pieces.
      (19)    When loading a long line of holes with more than one loading
crew, the crews shall be separated by the greatest practical distance which can
be maintained as the loading operations progress and which is consistent with
efficient operation and supervision of the crews. Every effort shall be made to
keep the loading crews a minimum of twenty-five feet apart and to prevent the
simultaneous loading of adjacent holes.
      (20)    Excessively large amounts of explosives shall not be delivered to
the loading area at one time. If deliveries of explosives are made by truck,
the quantity permitted at or near the loading operations shall be limited to
one truck load. Other trucks loaded with explosives shall wait or be unloaded
in separate safe places away from the loading operations.
      (21)    Explosives should be delivered first to the holes farthest from
the truck to avoid driving or walking among the piles of explosives.
      (22)    Explosives in excess of immediate requirements when removed from
the main storage magazine and delivered in the vicinity of a blasting operation
shall be stored in a Class A magazine.
      (23)    Sufficient suitable stemming or tamping material shall be placed
by each hole before the delivery of explosives to the holes is started.
      (24)    Stemming shall be placed in each hole with care to avoid damage
to the detonating fuse or leg wires of electric detonators.
      (25)    Only holes which are to be blasted immediately shall be loaded.
      (26)    Detonating fuse.
         A.    All detonating fuses shall be covered with maximum stemming
where physically possible.
         B.    When priming blast holes with detonating fuse, it shall be
lowered to the bottom of the hole either by attaching it to the first cartridge
or by other means. After allowance for settlement, it shall then be cut from
the reel and the reel moved well away or to the next hole before any other
explosives are loaded.
            1.    Where rigidly encased, large-diameter explosives cartridges
are used, a cartridge primed with detonating fuse may be placed near the bottom
or any intermediate point. With large continuous charges two or more primed
cartridges should be used.
            2.    If foreign matter, such as dirt or stones, should fall into a
hole while priming an explosive column with rigidly encased, large diameter
explosive cartridges and disturbs cartridge contact an additional primed
cartridge should be placed before continuing to charge the hole.
         C.    The detonating fuse shall extend from the hole a distance of one
or two feet more than sufficient to compensate for any subsidence, should be
drawn taut and made secure on the top where it will not interfere with loading
operations or come in contact with explosives on the ground.
         D.    It shall be checked each time before stemming material is used
to see that it has not been broken.
         E.    When detonating fuse is used, main trunk line splices shall be
factory splices or tight square knots. No splices shall be used in the drill
hole.
         F.    All branch line connections and all connections in the main line
other than splices shall be tight and at right angles.
         G.    The main or trunk line shall be laid out free of kinks or coils
and all connections shall be inspected before firing the blast.
         H.    When connecting an electric blasting cap to detonating fuse, the
type of connection used shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's
instructions. Two electric detonators separated by tape should be taped in
direct contact with the detonating fuse with their charged ends pointing in the
direction of detonating travel.
         I.    Detonators shall not be brought to the loading area nor attached
to the detonating fuse until all is in readiness to fire the blast.
         J.    A plain detonating fuse may be used for trunk lines or in
shallow drill holes but reinforced or wire countered types shall be used in
deep or ragged holes.
      (27)    Toe hole blasting.
         A.    The charge of explosives shall be pushed to the end of the hole
with a wooden pole using care not to block the hole.
         B.    Care shall be used in placing stemming in the hole especially if
loose explosives are on the bottom of the flat hole.
         C.    Only wooden poles shall be used in loading snake holes.
      (28)    Wagon drill hole blasting.
         A.    The same precautions shall be followed in loading small diameter
drill holes, such as wagon drill and jack hammer holes, as in loading larger
diameter holes.
         B.    When wagon drill holes or smaller diameter bore holes are to be
loaded for blasting, the explosives containers shall be stacked in piles out of
line with and at least twenty-five feet from the nearest drill hole to be
loaded.
         C.    The containers shall be opened at the piles as needed and the
opened explosives cases carried one at a time to the loading crew. The amount
of explosives at one hole shall be limited to 100 pounds. Empty cases and
lining paper shall be removed immediately to a waste pile. Since empty cases or
case linings may still contain explosives material, they shall be burned in the
open in a place where there will be no likelihood of damage to personnel or
property, and, as the fire is lighted, all personnel shall retire to a safe
distance from the burning pile until it has been completely burned.
      (29)    Quantities of explosives that may be used in primary blasting
shall be governed by allowable limits as set forth in these rules and
regulations.
   (k)    Secondary Blasting.
      (1)    Oversize fragments shall be reduced to shovel size by use of the
ball method, except as otherwise directed by the Service Director.
      (2)    Mud capping shall be prohibited except where written approval for
an exception has been received from the Service Director and then only where
areas are sparsely settled.
      (3)    No tools or equipment or activity of any kind shall be permitted
on a muck pile directly above a blaster while he is loading explosives into
holes.
      (4)    Charges of explosives shall be confined in all cases by suitable
stemming material.
      (5)    No person except the blaster and any others directly engaged in
loading holes shall be permitted within the immediate area while loading is
being performed. Loading of any hole shall be completed in one continuous
operation including insertion of the primer and the stemming.
      (6)    Not more than ten pounds of explosives shall be detonated at any
one time in a secondary shot provided however that trench shots shall be
governed by the requirements of Section
620.06.
   (l)    Control of Toxic Gases.
      (1)    This subsection shall apply to operations in shafts and tunnels.
      (2)    Explosives, fume classification.
         A.    Determination of fume classification. The fume classification of
an explosive shall be determined from the total volume of carbon monoxide and
hydrogen sulfide emitted in the Bichel gage by one, one and one-fourth by
eight-inch cartridge of the explosive to be tested. The standard procedure of
the Federal Bureau of Mines, modified to give results in terms of cubic feet
per cartridge of explosive, shall be used. This is as follows:
            One cartridge of the explosive one and one fourth by eight inches
or smaller, in its original wrapper, is fired in the Bichel gage. A gage of the
Bourdon type is substituted for the regular indicator mechanism. This Bourdon
gage is connected to the chamber of the bomb after the shot is fired. Before
the shot is fired the bomb is evacuated until a vacuum of fifty plus or minus
five mm. is obtained. The vacuum data used are the difference between the
barometer reading for the atmosphere and the manometer reading for the gage. In
order that the testing engineer may be assured of obtaining a vacuum and that
there may be no clogged lines, the valve connection for the pressure for the
pressure gage on top of the bomb should be left open until the vacuum pump has
been started and air is sucking through the valve. The charge is fired by means
of a No. 6 electric detonator embedded in the charge within the bomb. Five
minutes after the shot is fired the stopcock, which intervenes between the bomb
and the Bourdon gage is opened and the pressure noted. When the gage reading is
obtained the gaseous products within the gage have cooled to approximately room
temperature. The volume of the gases and vapors at O° C. and at a pressure of
760 mm. of mercury is calculated from the data obtained, which comprise gage
temperature, gage pressure, barometric pressure and volume of the bomb
(approximately fifteen litters).
            One-half hour after the shot is fired a sample of the gases and
vapors is taken through the valve to which the air pump was attached. The gases
are allowed to escape from the gage slowly by cracking the valve, and a 200-cc.
sample is thereby collected over mercury in the aspirator is allowed to run
out, and the gases and vapors that follow it are drawn off until the pressure
within the bomb is reduced to that of the atmosphere; therefore, the sample of
gases and vapors taken is a differential one.
            The gaseous products are analyzed by means of an Orsat apparatus,
and the amounts of carbon dioxide, oxygen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, methane,
nitrogen and hydrogen sulfide are determined. The amounts of these gases are
calculated to cubic feet per cartridge of explosive. The average result of
three analyses is accepted if the average deviation from the mean is less than
plus or minus 1.25 percent; otherwise, further analyses are made until the
above criterion is satisfied or until six analyses have been made, in which
latter instance the average of the six is accepted.
            A second calculation is made to determine whether the amount of
oxygen in the gaseous products is more than adequate to burn the combustible
gases to their maximum oxidizable state, that is, hydrogen to water, methane to
water and carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide to water and sulfur trioxide.
         B.    Fume classes. The amount of poisonous gases produced per one and
one-fourth by eight-inch cartridge shall be as follows:
 
Fume Class Cubic Feet
1          less than 0.16
2          0.16 to 0.333
3          0.33 to 0.67
            Cartridges of explosives eight inches in length that are smaller in
diameter than one and one-fourth inches shall comply with the limit specified
for the fume class of the one and one-fourth by eight-inch cartridge. For
cartridges smaller than eight inches in length and one and one-fourth inches or
less in diameter the amounts of poisonous gases produced in the Bichel gage are
computed by proportion to a length of eight inches, and this latter figure
shall comply with the limit specified for the fume class of the one and one-
fourth by eight-inch cartridge.
            For cartridges of any length and of diameter greater than one and
one-fourth inches the amounts of poisonous gases produced in the Bichel gage
are computed by proportion to the weight of a one and one-fourth by eight inch
cartridge; this latter figure shall comply with the limit specified for the
fume class of the one and one-fourth by eight-inch cartridge.
         C.    Designation on container. All cases containing explosives for
underground use shall be clearly marked in one-fourth of an inch or larger
letters with the appropriate fume classification.
      (3)    Explosives for use underground.
         A.    Limitation of fume class. No explosive other than those in fume
Class I shall be used in any shaft or tunnel.
         B.    Excess oxygen in gases produced. No explosive shall be used
underground if the gases emitted in the Bichel gage in tests described under
subsection (l)(2)B. hereof contain more oxygen than is necessary to burn the
combustible gases to their maximum oxidizable state.
         C.    Minimum size of cartridge. Explosives packed in cartridges less
than one inch in diameter shall not be used underground.
         D.    Deterioration. Explosives that show obvious deterioration, such
as incrustation of salts, exudation of liquids or extreme hardening or
softening shall not be used.
      (4)    Control of atmospheres underground.
         A.    Ventilation. Controlled ventilation shall be provided where
gases are produced by blasting or where inflammable gases are present.
         B.    Method of determining carbon monoxide. The standard method of
determining the concentration of carbon monoxide present shall be an approved
method.
         C.    Entering for short durations. An employee may enter for a period
not to exceed five minutes, concentrations of not more than 0.10 percent by
volume of carbon monoxide or, for a period not to exceed fifteen minutes,
concentrations of not more than 0.06 percent by volume.
         D.    Entering for prolonged time. When an employee enters with the
intention of remaining, ventilating must be maintained so that the air breathed
shall not exceed the following:
 
Carbon Monoxide                             Percent by Volume
At time of entrance up to 60 minutes        0.030
60 minutes after entrance up to 120 minutes .015
120 minutes after entrance and thereafter   .010
 
         E.    Use of respirators. When the concentration of carbon monoxide or
the time of exposure exceeds the requirements of subsection (4)C. hereof,
approved respiratory protection shall be provided for and used by every
employee entering underground.
         F.    Method of determining inflammable gas. The standard method of
determining inflammable gas shall be by an approved means.
         G.    Presence of inflammable gas. Blasting with explosives is
prohibited in places where the concentration of inflammable gas exceeds one and
one-half percent by volume.
         H.    Supervision. The contractor or operator shall designate an
employee whose duties it shall be:
            1.    To make tests to determine the concentrations of inflammable
gas;
            2.    To make tests to determine the concentrations of poisonous
gases;
            3.    To control the entrance and period of exposure of persons
entering underground.
            The employee so designated shall be provided with an approved gas
mask at the time such tests are made.
            The employee so designated shall keep a dated record of all tests,
which shall be on approved forms and available at all times.

subsection (c) hereof and the person also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
separate charge charging the violation of Section
333.01(a) of the Traffic Code that was the basis of the charge of the violation
of subsection (c) hereof, the conviction of or plea of guilty to the violation
of subsection (c) hereof shall not constitute, for purposes of any provision of
law that refers to a conviction of or plea of guilty to a violation of Section
333.01(a) of the Traffic Code, a conviction of or plea of guilty to a violation
of Section

   649.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, whenever any of the following words, terms
or definitions are used herein, they shall have the meaning ascribed to them in
this section. All acoustical terminology shall be that contained in ANSI S1.1
"Acoustical Terminology".
   (1)    "Ambient" means the all-encompassing sound associated with a given
environment without the noise source of interest.
   (2)    "ANSI" means the American National Standards Institute or its
successor bodies.
   (3)    "ARI" means the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute or its
successor bodies.
   (4)    "ASHRAE" means the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and
Air- Conditioning Engineers or its successor bodies.
   (5)    "ASTM" means the American Society for Testing Materials or its
successor bodies.
   (6)    "dBA" means the A-weighted sound-pressure level in decibels, as
measured by a sound-level meter complying with the provisions of American
Standard for General Purpose Sound Level Meters, American National Standards
Institute, properly calibrated, and operated on the "A" weighting network.
   (7)    "Decibel" means a unit for measuring the volume of a sound, equal to
the logarithm of the ratio of the intensity of the sound to the intensity of an
arbitrarily chosen standard sound "dB".
   (8)    "Director" means the Director of Public Safety.
   (9)    "Discrete tone" means a sound wave whose instantaneous sound pressure
varies essentially as a simple sinusoidal function of the time.
   (10)    "Fluctuating noise" means a noise whose sound pressure level varies
significantly but does not equal the ambient environmental level more than once
during the period of observation.
   (11)    "Intermittent noise" means a noise whose sound pressure level equals
the ambient environmental level two or more times during the period of
observation. The period of time during which the level of the noise remains at
an essentially constant value different from that of the ambient is on the
order of one second or more.
   (12)    "IEC" means the International Electrotechnical Commission or its
successor bodies.
   (13)   "ISO" means the International Organization for Standardization or its
successor bodies.
   (14)    "Mobile noise source" means any source (other than an individual) of
acoustic energy in motion relative to a fixed position.
   (15)    "Motor vehicle" means a vehicle as defined in Section
301.23 of these Codified Ordinances.
   (16)    "Noise level or sound-pressure level," in decibels, means ten times
the common logarithm of the ratio of the time-mean-square pressure of the sound
to the reference mean-square sound pressure. The reference mean-square sound
pressure shall be 4 x 10- microbars squared (twenty micropascal squared).
   (17)    "Noise pollution" means the presence of that amount of acoustic
energy for that period of time necessary:
      A.    To cause temporary or permanent hearing loss in persons exposed;
      B.    To be otherwise injurious, or tend to be injurious, on the basis of
current information, to the public health or welfare;
      C.    To cause a nuisance; or
      D.    To interfere with domestic tranquility, that is, the comfortable
enjoyment of life and property or the conduct of business.
   (18)    "Noise source" means any person or animal, or mechanical, electrical
or thermal device, which radiates acoustic energy. In those instances where
Federal noise emission standards are established for any noise source, then
those noise emission standards shall also be applicable to the same or similar
noise sources existing under conditions, such as noninterstate commerce, where
the Federal standards would not otherwise apply.
   (19)    "Nonsteady noise" means a noise whose level shifts significantly
during the period of observation.
   (20)    "Period of observation" means the time interval during which
acoustical data are obtained. The period of observation is determined by the
characteristics of the noise being measured and should also be at least ten
times as long as the response time of the instrumentation. The greater the
variance in indicated sound level, the longer shall be the observation time for
a given expected accuracy of the measurement.
   (21)    "Person" includes all natural and artificial persons, including, but
not limited to, partners, servants, principals, agents, employees, public or
private officials, associations, societies, clubs, firms, partnerships and all
bodies politic or corporate.

bodies.
   (23)    "Sound level (noise level)" for air-borne sound, means a weighted
sound pressure level, obtained by the use of metering characteristics and the
A-weighting as specified in the reference standards (ANSI). When the A-
weighting is employed, it shall be indicated.
   (24)    "Sound pressure level" in decibels, of a sound, is twenty times the
logarithm to the base ten of the ratio of the pressure of the sound to the
reference sound pressure. Unless otherwise specified, the effective (rms)
pressure is to be understood. The reference sound pressure is 20 uN/m2.
   (25)    "Stationary noise source" means any source (other than an
individual) of acoustic energy in a fixed position.
   (26)    "Steady noise" means a noise whose level remains essentially
constant and whose fluctuations are negligibly small during the period of
observation.

the violation occurs in the unincorporated area of one or more counties, or in
one or more municipal corporations, the officers and employees of each affected
county or municipal corporation may charge the railroad company with only one
violation of the law arising from the same facts and circumstances and the same
act.
      (5)   Upon the filing of an affidavit or complaint for violation of this
subsection (a)(1) hereof, summons shall be issued to the railroad company
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2935.10(B), which summons shall be served on the regular

Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways as follows:
         UNEVEN TRACKS SIGN W-66-24
         Size 24" x 24"
This sign shall be used at railroad crossings that are so uneven or rough that
they cause a reduction in speed 25% less than the prima facie speed for the
section of highway approaching the railroad. The Advisory Speed Sign shall be
used to indicate the maximum safe speed that the railroad crossing can be
comfortably traveled by passenger vehicles; The maximum safe speed shall be of
such a value that cargo will not shift on commercial vehicles or cause any
vehicle to deflect from its true course.

the value of neighboring property.
(Ord. 1991-17. Passed 5-31-91.)
   662.02 AUTHORITY OF CITY OFFICIALS.
   Whenever there shall be done or exist within the City any act, thing, or
condition of a kind which has been or may hereafter be defined by ordinance as
a nuisance, the Service Director and the Building Commissioner are authorized
and directed to promptly cause its abatement as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 1991-17. Passed 5-31-91.)
   662.03 ABATEMENT OF CERTAIN NUISANCES WITHOUT DECLARATION OF COUNCIL; NOTICE

   (a)   The Service Director or Building Commissioner, upon finding that a
nuisance exists in matters involving sidewalks, weeds, tall grass, landscaping,
or abandoned unusable personal property or other debris, may cause written
notice to be served on the owner of the real estate.  The notice shall set
forth the following items and be sent by certified mail to the tax mailing
address of the owner of the real estate or by posting the notice on the real
estate:
      (1)   The nature of the nuisance;
      (2)   The estimate of the cost of abating the same if done by the City;
      (3)   A reasonable time determined by the Service Director or Building
Commissioner within which the owner shall abate the nuisance or pay the
estimated cost to the City; and
      (4)   The statement that unless the nuisance is abated within the stated
time, it may be abated by the City and the cost of abatement assessed on the
real estate involved, and the City may prosecute the owner for failure to

Commissioner or both without reporting same to Council.  After five (5) days of
mailing or positioning the notice, the City may, through its employees, or by
direct employment of labor, abate the nuisance.  If the cost is not paid within
the time fixed by the Service Director or Building Commissioner, the Service
Director or Building Commissioner shall report the fact to Council which may
assess the cost incurred by use of City employees or by direct employment on
the real estate from which the nuisance originated in the same manner as other

declare such condition, building or structure a nuisance. The Council may
specify, upon the advice of the Service Director or Building Commissioner, what
reasonable repairs or maintenance measures are necessary to abate such
nuisance.
   (b)    Upon such finding and declaration, the Service Director or Building
Commissioner may proceed in the manner provided in Section
662.03 for the abatement of nuisances. (Ord. 1991-17. Passed 5-31-91.)
   662.05 SERVICE OF NOTICE.

Ordinance
663.03.  (Ord. 2018-6.  Passed 3-13-18.)
663.03  ACTION TO ABATE NUISANCES; COSTS OF ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    Notice of Declaration of Nuisance. The Mayor, upon finding that four
(4) or more nuisance activities as defined in Section
663.02 have occurred on separate occasions within any three hundred sixty-five
(365) day period on the same residential property may cause a written notice
and order to be served on the owner of the property declaring that the property
is a nuisance property. This notice and order shall identify the nuisance
activities, and the estimated costs to abate any future nuisance activity;
shall state that the owner may avoid being charged the costs of abatement by
taking steps to prevent any further nuisance activity as set forth in division
(d) of this Section; and shall state the appeal process. The notice shall
further state that if a fifth or subsequent nuisance activity as defined in
Section
663.02 occurs later than thirteen (13) days after the date of the written
nuisance declaration notice and within twelve (12) months of the date of the
fourth or any subsequent nuisance activity, the City may abate the nuisance by
responding to the activities using administrative and law enforcement actions,
and the costs of the abatement shall be charged to the owner of the nuisance
property and may be certified as a lien on the nuisance property. Notice shall
be deemed properly delivered by delivering it personally to the owner or
leaving it at the owner's usual place of business or residence, or by mailing
it to the owner, or, if it cannot be served in any of the other ways mentioned
above, by publishing it once in a newspaper of general circulation within the
City, or by posting it in a conspicuous place on the property involved.
   (b)    Abatement. If the Mayor determines that a fifth or subsequent
nuisance activity as defined in Section
663.02 occurs later than thirteen (13) days after the date of the initial
written nuisance declaration notice and within twelve (12) months after the
date of the fourth or any subsequent nuisance activity, the City may abate the
nuisance activity by using administrative and law enforcement actions, and the
costs of the abatement shall be charged to the owner of the property and, if
not paid, may be certified by the Director of Finance to the County Auditor to
be placed on the nuisance property as a lien to be collected as other taxes and
returned to the City. The cost to abate the nuisance activity shall be
calculated as set forth in division (c). The City shall provide notice to the
owner of the nuisance property of the City's decision to charge the cost of
abatement. If the costs are not paid by the owner, the City shall notify the
owner at least thirty (30) days before the costs are certified to the County
Auditor. The notice shall contain a street address or legal description of the
property, a description of the nuisance activities and the cost to abate.
Notices shall be served as set forth in division (a) of this section. The Law
Director may take any other action necessary to collect the costs of abatement.
   (c)    Costs of Abatement. Costs of abatement shall be determined based on
the time required to respond to the nuisance activity multiplied by an hourly
rate based upon the wages and benefits of a police officer, fireman, animal
warden, building department inspector or other enforcement officer, dispatch
costs, vehicle and equipment costs, and supervisory and administrative costs.
The hourly rate may be adjusted based on the number of City employees required
to abate the nuisance.
   (d)    Nuisance Abatement Plan. The owner of a nuisance property may avoid
being charged the cost of abating future nuisances if the owner meets with the
Mayor; presents a plan to prevent further nuisance activity and that plan is
approved by the Mayor; and the owner implements the plan.
   (e)    Appeal. The owner of a nuisance property who receives a notice
declaring the owner's property to be a nuisance property, a notice charging the
cost of abating nuisance activity, or a notice that the cost of abatement shall
be certified to the County Auditor, may appeal the notice by submitting a
written request to reconsider to the Mayor within ten (10) days of the date of
the notice. If, after a decision on that request, the owner disagrees with the
decision, the owner may appeal the decision of the Mayor to the Board of
Building and Zoning Board of Appeals. An appeal to the Board of Building and
Zoning Board of Appeals shall be made within fifteen (15) days of the postmark
date of the decision from the Mayor denying the request for reconsideration.
The Board shall conduct a hearing and render a decision in accordance with City
ordinances and rules governing its conduct and procedure. An appeal to the
Board of Building and Zoning Board of Appeals shall not stay any actions by the
City to abate any subsequent nuisance activity. In an appeal to the Board of
Building and Zoning Appeals of a nuisance declaration notice, the City must
show by a preponderance of the evidence that there was probable cause to
believe that each nuisance activity stated in the notice being appealed has
occurred, and that the declaration of the property as a nuisance property is
justified. In an appeal to the Board of Building and Zoning Board of Appeals of
a notice charging the cost of abating nuisance activity, or a notice that the
cost of abatement shall be certified to the County Auditor, the City must show
by a preponderance of the evidence that the charging of abatement costs or the
certification of abatement costs is justified. The owner may prevail on appeal
of any notice if the owner demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence
that:
      (1)    He or she was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the notice; or
      (2)    He or she had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but promptly and
vigorously took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance activity including,
without limitation, compliance with the requirements of division (C) of Section
5321.17 and division (A)(9) of Section 5321.04 of the Revised Code; or
      (3)    He or she had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not,
with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity; and
upon receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property he or she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance
including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of division (C)
of Section 5321.17 and division (A)(9) of Section 5321.04 of the Revised Code.
   (f)    Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the City to pursue other remedies
against any owner. occupant. or invitee as provided in the City's Codified
Ordinances or the laws of the State of Ohio.  (Ord. 2018-6.  Passed 3-13-18.)
663.04  FAILURE TO ABATE NUISANCE ACTIVITY.
   (a)    Whenever a property owner has been billed on three (3) or more
separate dates within a two-year time period for the cost to abate nuisance
activity under this Chapter, the Mayor shall notify the property owner that he
or she may be issued a criminal citation for a misdemeanor of the second degree
thirty (30) days after the third bill is issued.
   (b)    No property owner shall fail to abate nuisance activity within thirty
(30) days after the third bill within a two-year time period for the cost to
abate nuisance activity under this Chapter.
   (c)    Whoever violates this section is guilty of failure to abate nuisance

   670.01 PURPOSE; DEFINITIONS.
   (a)    The purpose of this chapter is to provide minimum standards and
regulations insuring the safe shipment and transportation of radioactive
materials through the City.
   (b)    As used in this chapter the word "shall" is always mandatory and not
merely directory. In addition:
      (1)    "Radioactive material" means any material or combination of
materials, which spontaneously emits ionizing radiation. Materials in which the
estimated specific activity is not greater than 0.002 microcuries per gram of
material, and in which the radioactivity is essentially uniformly distributed,
are not considered to be radioactive materials.
      (2)    "Large quantity radioactive materials" means a quantity the
aggregate radioactivity of which exceeds that specified in 10 Code of Federal
Regulations (C.F.R.) Part 71, entitled "Packaging of Radioactive Material for
Transport," Section 71.4(f).
      (3)    "Curie" means an expression of the quantity of radiation in terms
of the number of atoms which disintegrate per second; a curie is that quantity
of radioactive materials which decays such that 37,000,000,000 atoms
disintegrate per second.
      (4)    "Millicurie" means one thousandth of a curie.
      (5)    "Motor vehicle" means any vehicle defined as a motor vehicle in
Section
301.23 of the Traffic Code.
      (6)    "Person" means any individual, partnership or corporation engaged
in the transportation of passengers or property, as a common, contract or
private carrier, or a freight forwarder, as those terms are used in the
Interstate Commerce Act, as amended.

defined in Section
606.01(i), and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense; he commits a subsequent offense of violence;

he commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)    Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses,

   (b)    "Dangerous offender" means a person who has committed an offense,

consequences.
      (ORC 2929.01)
   698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
five hundred dollars ($1,500);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00).
(Ord. 1994-82.  Passed 11-17-94.)
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control

section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.

the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the

specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,

      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and

of judgment against the person as described in that section.

   (a)    In determining whether to impose imprisonment or a fine, or both, for
misdemeanor, and in determining the term of imprisonment and the amount and
method of payment of a fine, the court shall consider the risk that the
offender will commit another offense and the need for protecting the public
therefrom, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history, character
and condition of the offender and his need for correctional or rehabilitative
treatment, and the ability and resources of the offender and the nature of the
burden that payment of a fine will impose on him.

considered in favor of imposing imprisonment for misdemeanor:
      (1)    The offender is a repeat or dangerous offender;
      (2)    Regardless of whether or not the offender knew the age of the
victim, the victim of the offense was sixty-five years of age or older or
permanently    and totally disabled at the time of the commission of the
offense.
   (c)    The criteria listed in Ohio R. C. 2929.12, favoring shorter terms of
imprisonment for felony, do not control the court’s discretion, but shall be
considered against imposing imprisonment for misdemeanor.

construed to limit the matters which may be considered in determining whether
to impose imprisonment for misdemeanor.
   (e)    The court shall not impose a fine in addition to imprisonment for
misdemeanor, unless a fine is specially adapted to deterrence of the offense or
the correction of the offender, or the offense has proximately resulted in
physical harm to the person or property of another, or the offense was
committed for hire or for purpose of gain.
   (f)    The court shall not impose a fine or fines which, in the aggregate
and to the extent not suspended by the court, exceeds the amount which the
offender is or will be able to pay by the method and within the time allowed
without undue hardship to himself or his dependents, or will prevent him from
making restitution or reparation to the victim of his offense.
   (g)    At the time of sentencing or as soon as possible after sentencing,
the court shall notify the victim of the offense of his right to file an
application for an award of reparations pursuant to Ohio R. C. 2743.51 through

   (b)    When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)    When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.

imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other sentence of

be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed.
   (d)    Consecutive terms of imprisonment imposed shall not exceed an
aggregate term of eighteen months, when the consecutive terms imposed are for
misdemeanors. When consecutive terms aggregating more than one year are imposed
for misdemeanors under the Ohio Revised Code or these Codified Ordinances, and
at least one such consecutive term is for a misdemeanor of the first degree
that is an offense of violence, the trial court may order the aggregate term
imposed to be served in a State penal or reformatory institution.

recognized industry standard. The applicant may be required to submit evidence
of the reliability and suitability of the equipment to be installed before a
permit is issued or thereafter.
   (b)    The sensory mechanism used in connection with such devices must be
adjusted to suppress false indications of fire or intrusion so that the devices
will not be actuated by impulses due to transient pressure change in water
pipes, short flashes of light, wind noises such as the rattling or vibrating of
doors or windows, vehicular noise adjacent to the installation or other forces
unrelated to genuine alarms.
   (c)    All components comprising such a device must be maintained by the
owner, lessee and/or user in good repair to ensure reliability of operations.
   (d)    Each alarm equipment supplier that sells or leases an automatic
protection device which is installed on any premises in the City shall furnish
instructions for the operation and maintenance of such device to the purchaser
or lessee.
   (e)    Each alarm equipment supplier shall also furnish the Chief of Police
and/or the Fire Chief with a copy of the instructions as to the way the device
operates. If the Chief of Police and/or the Fire Chief finds such instructions
to be incomplete, unclear or otherwise inadequate, he or she may require the
alarm equipment supplier to have the same revised to meet his or her approval
and then to promptly have copies distributed to persons for whom installations
of such devices are made.
   (f)   Each alarm equipment supplier who sells or leases an alarm system with
an automatic dialer, for which a permit is required, must provide, through
himself or herself, or through an independent contractor, a means for receiving
calls for service, directly or through an agent, on a twenty-four hour basis,
seven days a week, and shall respond to such calls within eight hours of the
time they are received.
   (g)    At the time of installation, each alarm equipment supplier shall
furnish to the person for whom an alarm system has been installed written
information as to how service can be obtained at anytime, including the
telephone number to call for service. Such user shall be responsible for having
the device repaired as quickly as possible after learning, either from his or
her own sources or from notification by the City, that the device is not
working properly.
   (h)    Any City official may, at reasonable times and upon prior notice,
where possible, enter upon any premises within the City to inspect the
installation and operation of an automatic protection device or signaling
device, the purpose of which device is to report an emergency to the police
and/or fire station. Refusal to permit entrance shall be grounds for revocation
of the permit. Such official may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction
for a warrant to enter under circumstances where the owner or person in charge
refuses or neglects entrance, or is absent, to inspect the equipment. Where
there is insufficient time to reasonably obtain a search warrant under urgent
circumstances, the safety forces may enter the property to abate a nuisance or
conduct a required investigation.
   (i)    All equipment referred to in this chapter shall be maintained in good
operating condition. Any City official may require that repairs be made
whenever the official has determined that such are necessary to ensure proper
operation.
   (j)    For a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, for an
incomplete or untruthful application, for failure to properly maintain an
installation or for four or more false alarms in any twelve-month period, the
Chief of Police may serve written notice upon a permit holder, at the
permittee's application address, of intent to revoke his or her permit. Such
notice shall be given not less than seven days prior to revocation. Such notice
shall state the right of the permit holder to appeal to the Chief of Police in
writing within seven days of the order. If an appeal is filed, the Chief of
Police shall hold a quasijudicial hearing on the issues and any interested
party may be present, represented by an attorney and permitted to bring
witnesses and to examine and cross-examine any witness. The Chief of Police
shall render a decision on the basis of the facts presented. The decision shall
be final. If no appeal is filed, the permit shall be canceled. Upon
cancellation, the Chief of Police and/or the Fire Chief shall take whatever
steps are necessary to disconnect the alarm. Any service of notice shall be
complete by leaving it at the place where the equipment is located or with a
person living or working at such place or by delivery to a place indicated on
the permit or any application.
(Ord. 1987-43. Passed 12-8-87.)
   725.09 NONLIABILITY OF CITY.
   The issuance, nonissuance or cancellation of any permit under this chapter
and any other act or omission of the City and/or its agents and employees shall
not constitute acceptance by the City of any liability whatsoever to maintain
any equipment, to answer alarms or to do anything else in connection therewith.
No person shall have an expectancy or reliance upon this voluntary service of
the City, and the City's liability in contract, tort or otherwise, shall not
exceed a return of the permit fee.

Chief of Police.

consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation
to their flows and velocities in the sewers, the materials of construction of
the sewers, the nature of the sewage treatment process, the capacity of the
sewage treatment plants, the degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage
treatment plants, and other pertinent factors. The prohibited substances,
materials, waters or wastes are as follows:

plants' effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over the discharge of such water or waste to the receiving waters.
   (b)    If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged into the public sewers, which waters or wastes contain the
substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection (a) hereof
and which, in the judgment of the City’s designee in charge of its sewage
treatment plants, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works,
processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to
life or constitute a public nuisance, the City may:

the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions
of subsection (d) hereof.

pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the
plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of such
designee and shall be subject to the requirements of all applicable codes,
ordinances and laws.
   (c)    Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the City's designee in charge of its sewage treatment plants, they
are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in
excessive amounts, any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients,
except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters
or dwelling units. All such interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
approved by such designee and shall be located so as to be readily and easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection.

CHAPTER 1101
Planning Commission
EDITOR'S NOTE: There are no ordinances establishing or specifying the powers of
the Planning Commission inasmuch as the Planning Commission is established by
the Municipal Charter. The following are the provisions of the Charter, Article
IV, Section 5, relating to the Planning Commission:
SECTION 5. PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)    Membership and Terms. The Planning Commission shall consist of the
Mayor, one member of Council to be elected by Council and three electors of the
Municipality, not holding other elective or appointive office in the
Municipality to be appointed by the Mayor, subject to the approval of a
majority of the members elected to Council. The terms of the present members of
the Planning Commission shall terminate December 31, 1959. The three citizen
members shall be appointed for terms of two, four and six years respectively,
commencing January 1, 1960, and their successors shall be appointed for terms
of six years thereafter. A vacancy occurring during the term of any member of
the Planning Commission shall be filled in the same manner for the unexpired
term. Any citizen member of the Planning Commission may be removed by the Mayor
with the consent of a majority of the members elected to Council. At its first
meeting in January, 1960, and every two years thereafter, the Planning
Commission shall elect one of its members as chairman to serve for a period of
two years.
   (b)    Duties. The Planning Commission shall have such powers and duties as
may be conferred upon it by ordinance of Council concerning the plan, design,
location, removal, relocation and alteration of any public building or
structure or those located within any public street or property; the location,
relocation, widening, extension and vacation of streets, parkways, playgrounds
and other public places; the approval of plats for the subdivision of land;
zoning and rezoning of the Municipality for any lawful purpose and such other
powers as may now or hereafter be conferred upon it by ordinance of Council.
   (c)    Zoning Ordinances. Council may from time to time enact or amend such
zoning ordinances and regulations as it may deem necessary, providing for the
regulation of the use of land and the location, size, safety and appearance and
use of buildings and structures and shall provide the procedure for enacting or
amending zoning ordinances and regulations. Before enacting any such ordinance
or amendment thereto, Council shall first hold a public hearing thereon at
which any interested person may be heard in respect thereto. Notice of the
date, time and place of such hearing shall be published at least once in all
newspapers of general circulation in the Municipality, as determined by
Council, not less than thirty days prior to such hearing, and such ordinance,
regulation or amendment shall be on file and available for inspection in the
office of the Clerk of Council during such period. In addition, for zoning
ordinances or amendments which intend to rezone or redistrict twenty or less
parcels of land, Council shall provide by ordinance for a procedure which at
the least requires that written notice be mailed at least ten days prior to a
public hearing to the owners of property within, abutting on and directly
across the street from the parcel or parcels to be rezoned or redistricted, and
in addition, to the owners of property which is contiguous to any of the
aforesaid property. Unless such ordinance, regulation or amendment thereto has
been recommended to Council by the Planning Commission, Council shall refer it
to the Planning Commission for its recommendation and any such ordinance,
resolution or amendment not recommended for passage by the Planning Commission
shall require the affirmative vote of at least five members of Council for its
enactment.
(Approved by voters November 4, 1975.)
   (d)    Zoning of Lands for Multiple Family Dwellings. The Council may from
time to time enact or amend such zoning ordinances and regulations to provide
for multiple family dwellings as it may deem necessary, providing for the
regulation of the use of land and the location, size, safety and appearance and
use of buildings and structures. Before enacting any such zoning ordinance or
amendment thereto relating to multiple family dwellings, the Council shall
first hold a public hearing thereon at which any interested person may be heard
in respect thereto. Notice of the date, time and place of such hearing shall be
published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the
Municipality not less than thirty (30) days prior to such hearing and such
ordinance, regulation or amendment shall be on file and available for
inspection in the office of the Clerk of Council during such period. Unless
such ordinance, regulation or amendment thereto has been recommended to the
Council by the Planning Commission, the Council shall refer it to the Planning
Commission for its recommendation and any such ordinance, resolution or
amendment not recommended for passage by the Planning Commission shall require
the affirmative vote of at least five (5) members of the Council for its
approval.
   Upon receiving such approval by Council, such proposed ordinance, regulation
or amendment shall be certified to the Board of Elections to be submitted to
the electors at the next general or regular municipal election occurring more
than ninety (90) days after the approval by Council.
(Approved by voters November 3, 1970.)
   (e)    Zoning of Lands for Prohibited Uses. Council may from time to time
enact an ordinance amending the zoning ordinances to permit and regulate any
use which at the time of enactment of such ordinance is a prohibited use under
such zoning ordinances, as it may deem necessary providing for the regulation
of the use of land and the location, size, safety and appearance and uses of
buildings and structures for such uses. Before enacting any such zoning
ordinance or amendment thereto relating to the use of land for such prohibited
uses, such ordinance shall be subject to all of the procedures set forth in
Article IV, Section 5(c), of this Charter.
   Upon receiving approval by Council, such proposed ordinance shall be
certified to the Board of Elections to be submitted to the electors at the next
general or regular municipal election occurring more than ninety (90) days
after such certification. Provided, however, that without approval or rejection
of any such ordinance, Council may also vote to submit such ordinance to the
electors for approval or rejection at the next general or regular municipal
election occurring more than ninety (90) days after certification to the Board
of Elections. Such submitted ordinance shall not become effective unless it
shall be approved by a majority of the electors voting upon such ordinance.

   1109.01 INTENT.
   Procedures are herein established for achieving effectiveness, efficiency
and uniformity in the administration of the Subdivision Code, including:
   (a)    Procedures by which a developer may obtain information, plan and
developments, make application for review, record plats and construct land
improvements;
   (b)    Procedures by which the Commission may review, study, make
recommendations, approve the plans and plats and otherwise administer these
regulations; and
   (c)    Procedures for planning and developing land consistent with
procedures for planned development areas as set forth in the Zoning Code and in
accordance with the objectives of the Master Plan.
      (Ord. 1967-37. Passed 1-9-68.)
   1109.02 PREAPPLICATION; SALE COPES.
   The City shall make available copies of this Subdivision Code, the Zoning
Code, the Street Plan, the Community Facilities Plan and other maps and
relevant information at a cost to be determined by Council. Any developer may
request an advance discussion of the procedures and criteria for developing
land at regular meetings of the Commission.
(Ord. 1967-37. Passed 1-9-68.)
   1109.03 MINOR SUBDIVISION; APPLICATION.
   (a)    Classification. A subdivision is classified as a minor subdivision if
it comprises a division of a parcel of land along an existing public street not
involving the opening, widening or extension of any street or road, not
involving the installation of any underground public utilities and not
involving more than five lots after the original tract and all the contiguous
land owned by the developer has been completely subdivided. The replatting of
not more than five lots along a public street is also classified as a minor
subdivision.
(Ord. 1967-37. Passed 1-9-68.)
   (b)    Application. An application for approval for each minor subdivision
including a sketch plan complying with the requirements set forth in Section
1115.02 shall be filed by the developer with the Secretary of the Planning
Commission. The Commission may take action upon the application after its
receipt of all required information. Except, however, if the application
discloses that the minor subdivision or lot split will result in a
nonconforming lot under the Code, the Commission shall not approve the
application at the first regularly scheduled meeting at which it reviews the
application. The earliest date of approval for such an application shall be the
second regularly scheduled meeting after the application's presentation to the
Commission so that all necessary approvals may be obtained and that all
residents may have an opportunity to understand the application.
(Ord. 1991-54. Passed 11-12-91.)
   (c)    Approval. If the Commission finds after reviewing the proposed
division of land that:
      (1)    Not more than five lots will be created and all the land in the
original tract and all the contiguous land owned by the developer would be
completely subdivided;
      (2)    The sketch plan is properly coordinated with adjoining development
and adjoining unplatted land; and
      (3)    The sketch plan complies with the planning criteria and other
provisions of the Subdivision Code and other codes and plans of the City
applying to minor subdivisions, then the Commission shall approve the proposed
minor subdivision.
   A notation of the action taken shall be made on the sketch plan by the
Secretary, Chairman or other officials as may be designated by the Commission,
and the developer shall be informed if a metes and bounds deed description or a
plat will be required. Three prints of the approved sketch plan shall be
furnished to the Commission.
   If the Commission determines the proposal should be reviewed as a major
subdivision or if the proposal cannot be approved for other reasons, the
Commission may suggest revisions to the plan before it is resubmitted.
(Ord. 1967-37. Passed 1-9-68.)
   1109.04 MAJOR SUBDIVISION; PRELIMINARY PLAN.
   (a)    Classification. A subdivision is classified as a major subdivision if
more than five lots are created, or if any subdivision or resubdivision
involves the opening, widening or extension of any street, the allocation of
land for open space for common use, or the granting of easements for the
extension and maintenance of water supply, sewage disposal or other public
facilities in connection with the improvements of one or more parcels of land
for residential, business or industrial developments.
   (b)    Application. An application for approval shall include aerial
photography and topography at a two foot contour interval and five black line
prints of the preliminary plan or alternate plans complying with the planning
criteria set forth in Section
1115.03 and shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Commission for each
proposed major subdivision. The purposes of the preliminary plan are to explore
the best subdivision design and its relationship to the natural features of the
development area and adjoining developments or vacant land, to outline a
program of land improvements and obtain the suggestions and recommendations of
the Commission before a firm plan is prepared.
   (c)    Planning Commission Action. Whenever the Commission has received an
application and all of the maps, drawings, data and plans required by Section
1115.03, the Mayor's Secretary shall place such application on the agenda of
its next regular meeting for preliminary discussion. The Commission shall
thereafter set a date for a public hearing.
      (1)    The Mayor's Secretary shall refer one copy to the Commission's
Planning Consultant and one copy to the Engineer for review and report with
respect to compliance with all relevant regulations, standards and criteria,
relative to coordination of the design with the natural features of the site
and surrounding developments and to conformance with the components of the
Master Plan. Within three weeks from receiving such a preliminary plan, the
Planning Consultant and Engineer shall provide and furnish their reports to the
Commission.
      (2)    The Commission shall notify the owners, as shown upon the current
records of the County Recorder, of adjoining unsubdivided land and owners of
adjoining lots if a street connection is involved of the time and place of a
public hearing. The owners shall be notified by first-class mail sent at least
ten days before the public hearing at which the proposed subdivision is to be
considered. Failure of delivery of such notice shall not invalidate the
proceedings.
      (3)    The Commission shall act not later than the next regular meeting
after the public hearing or within an extension mutually agreed upon by the
Commission and applicant. If the Commission, after an evaluation of the
preliminary plan and reports of the Planning Consultant and Engineer, approves
the preliminary plan, the Chairman and Secretary shall affix their signatures
to five copies of the plan with a notation of any special conditions, as the
Commission may attach, and shall recommend the plan to Council for its
approval. Council shall approve or disapprove the recommendations within sixty
days. Upon approval, the Clerk of Council shall return one copy to the
developer, and shall retain one copy. Notice of the approval shall be sent to
the Board of Education.
      (4)    If the Commission or Council fails to approve the preliminary
plan, it shall state in its records the reason or reasons for such disapproval.
   (d)    Effect of Authorization to Proceed. The approval of the preliminary
plan by Council authorizes the developer to proceed with the preparation of the
final plat, including improvement plans, and assures him that within a one-year
period from the date of such authorization:
      (1)    The general layout of streets, lots and other features of the
preliminary plan may serve as the basis for the preparation of the final plat;
      (2)    Any special conditions under which the approval of the plan was
granted shall not be changed;
      (3)    The developer may submit a final plat and drawings and
specifications for improvements for the whole or part of the subdivision.
         (Ord. 1991-18. Passed 5-12-92.)
   1109.05 MAJOR SUBDIVISION; FINAL PLAT.
   (a)    Application. An application for approval of a final plat shall be
filed with the Secretary of the Commission within one year after the Council's
approval of the preliminary plan and authorization to proceed unless the
Commission extends the time. The application shall include the original tracing
of the final plat, the original tracing of the drawings for the required
improvements, three black-line prints of each tracing, three sets of
specifications and other maps, data and certificates as required and set forth
in Section
1115.04.
   The developer may obtain approval of the plat prior to the installation of
the required improvements. Alternatively, he may apply for approval of the
final plat and include drawings and specifications of required improvements and
concurrently furnish an approved performance guarantee bond or cash surety that
he will install the improvements thereafter. Such bond or surety shall be in
the form as set forth in subsection (c) hereof.
   The developer may apply for final plat approval for only that section of an
approved preliminary plan of a subdivision for which he proposed to develop and
record as the first stage; however, the approval of any section of the
preliminary plan shall become null and void if an application for final plat
approval is not submitted within one year after approval of the preliminary
plan, unless an extension of time is granted by the Commission.
   (b)    Review by the Engineer. The Secretary of the Commission shall
transmit two prints of each drawing and the specifications to the Engineer for
a determination if:
      (1)    The final plat conforms to the approved preliminary plans and any
special conditions or modifications stipulated, and for correctness of
mathematical data and computations; and
      (2)    The designs and details of the required improvements as shown on
the drawings and specifications for utilities and streets are in conformance
with the approved standards of the City. One copy of the drawings and
specifications shall be returned to the Commission within ten days indicating
his findings and recommendations.
   (c)    Action by the Planning Commission. If the Engineer determines the
final plat, drawings and specifications are satisfactory in regard to the above
provisions, and if the subdivision complies with all other applicable
provisions of these regulations, the Commission shall approve it. Action shall
be taken within one month after the meeting at which the application for
approval and all required plats, maps and data were submitted to the
Commission, or within one month after an extension of time set by the
Commission. The Commission shall act upon the final plat, drawings and
specifications, either separately or concurrently, but in no event shall it
approve the final plat for recording until the improvements either are
constructed by the developer or their construction guaranteed by an approved
performance guarantee bond or a cash surety. The amount shall be the costs of
the improvements as estimated by the Engineer. The form of the bond shall be
subject to approval by the Law Director. After the final plat has been approved
by the Commission, it shall be submitted to Council for its approval prior to
recording.
   (d)    Form of Approval. The approval of the final plat shall be indicated
by a certification to that effect on the original tracing of the plat with the
signature of the Chairman and Secretary of the Commission and of the Clerk of
Council. The Commission shall obtain one duplicate tracing thereof at the
developer's expense before returning the tracing to him. The reason for
disapproval of a plat shall be stated in the records of the Commission or the
minutes of Council.
   The approval of the drawing and specifications for the required improvements
shall be indicated by a certification to that effect on the original drawings
and specification with the signature of the Engineer. Approval of the
improvements as constructed shall likewise be certified by the Engineer.
   (e)    Recording. The Engineer shall file the approved final plat in the
office of the County Recorder. The approval of the Commission and Council shall
expire within sixty days unless within that period the plat shall have been
duly filed and recorded and the Commission and Council so notified by the
developer in writing. If the final plat is revised in any manner after
approval, a new approval will be necessary.
   (f)    Effect of Approval and Recording. When drawings and specifications
for improvements are approved and construction guaranteed, and the final plat
is approved and recorded, construction of improvements may commence, building
permits may be issued and lots may be sold and transferred.
   The developer may proceed with the construction of the required improvements
prior to recording of the final plat provided the final subdivision plat and
improvement plans have been approved. In such case, the Engineer shall retain
the final plat until all improvements are complete and certified by the
Engineer or their completion is guaranteed by an approved performance guarantee
bond or a cash surety and all other conditions have been satisfied. If the
improvements are not completely installed within one year from the date of
approval, the approval shall lapse and the developer must resubmit the final
plat before proceeding with any aspect of development. The final plat may be
recorded only by the Engineer and shall be at the expense of the developer.
   Occupancy permits for building shall not be issued until all streets and
utilities are accepted for public use by Council, or a cash surety guaranteeing
the completion of the improvements has been submitted and accepted by the City.
(Ord. 1991-18. Passed 5-12-92.)
   1109.06 LAND DEDICATION FOR PUBLIC AND COMMON USE.
   (a)    Dedication for Public Use. The plat shall be submitted to Council for
acceptance of dedication of any land for public use and acceptance of any
easement before it is recorded. The acceptance of any street or utility for
public use and maintenance and assignment of street names shall be by separate
action of Council. In addition to being shown on the plat, all utility
easements shall be conveyed to the City by a separate written grant of easement
which shall be subject to approval by the Law Director and City Engineer and
shall be recorded concurrently with the final plat.
   (b)    Land Reserved for Public Use. In addition to land for local streets
which principally serve the subdivision under consideration, the City may
request by resolution that land for other streets, parks, playgrounds or other
public uses as shown on the official Master Plan, the Street Plan or Community
Facilities Plan or determining by adopted standards, be set aside and reserved
for a period of 120 days after the application for approval of a preliminary
plan of a subdivision is submitted, or for a longer period as may be mutually
agreed, to allow the City time to start proceedings to acquire such land by
gift, purchase, exchange, devise or appropriation.
   During such period, no structure shall be erected, no trees or topsoil shall
be removed or destroyed, no grading shall be done nor shall any land so
reserved be put to any use whatsoever except on written approval of the
Commission.
   (c)    Common Land. Whenever a developer submits a plan showing common land
either for recreation, streets, pedestrian circulation or other purposes, the
covenants and restrictions of such land shall be submitted with the plans of
the subdivision to the Commission. The Commission shall not approve any common
land unless such covenants and restrictions set forth that the common land
shall be:
      (1)    Used only for the uses set forth in the restrictions and
covenants;
      (2)    Improved by the developer;
      (3)    Owned by a home association, condominium ownership or similar
private organization with owners of each dwelling unit having a share in the
common land; and
      (4)    Maintained at no cost to the City with the owner of each dwelling
responsible for his share of the maintenance cost, which share when not paid
shall be a lien against the property.
   Such covenants and restrictions shall be subject to approval by the Law
Director.
(Ord. 1991-18. Passed 5-12-92.)
   1109.07 BUSINESS AND INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   An application and preliminary plan shall be submitted by the developer to
the Commission for all proposals for business and industrial subdivisions
involving the division or allocation of land for open spaces for common use,
for the opening or extensions of streets or as easements for the extension and
maintenance of sewers, water supply or other public facilities.
   The preliminary plans of such subdivisions shall be planned in accordance
with the planning criteria established in Chapter
1111 and all maps, plans and other data required and set forth in Section
1115.03 shall be furnished if determined applicable by the Commission.
   All procedures, maps and other data required and set forth in Section
1115.04 shall be complied with and furnished, if determined applicable by the
Commission, in the preparation of final plats of subdivisions where streets or
other areas are to be used by the public and where public utilities are to be
constructed.
(Ord. 1967-37. Passed 1-9-68.)
   1109.08 CITY MAP.
   In order that proposed subdivisions may be properly planned and reviewed, a
map of the City showing all streets, lot lines, topographic contours and
wetland areas shall be kept up to date by the Engineer and maintained on file
by the Clerk of Council. Preliminary plans when approved shall be indicated on
a print of the City map, and every final plat or deed description when recorded
shall be added to the tracings thereof.
(Ord. 1991-18. Passed 5-12-92.)
   1109.09 RESUBDIVISION AND VACATION.
   An application for resubdividing, replatting or vacation of a subdivision or
a part thereof shall be made by the owner to the Commission in the same form as
for an original subdivision along with all required maps and other information.
The original lots shall be shown by dotted lines, lot numbers and other
references made to the previously recorded subdivision. After a replatting or
vacation is approved by the Commission, it shall be submitted to the Clerk of
the Court of Common Pleas if required by the provisions of Ohio R.C. 711.17 to
711.31 inclusive.

   1111.01 INTENT.
   Planning criteria are herein established as fundamental principles and each
are to be applied with professional skill in the planning, subdividing and
resubdividing the land in order to achieve, among other things, the following
purposes:
   (a)    To provide for the planning of attractive neighborhoods which
recognize the natural topography and other physical features of the development
area;
   (b)    To protect and maintain all existing wetland areas in the City;
   (c)    To relate the planning of neighborhoods to a pedestrian and vehicular
circulation system, to implement the Street Plan, to provide convenient and
safe local streets;
   (d)    To provide protected neighborhoods; to plan a common green area
network where desired; however, under all types of neighborhood planning, each
lot shall form a functional building site;
   (e)    To provide for the implementation of the Community Facilities Plan by
reserving and acquiring sites for public uses;
   (f)    To provide for planned industrial subdivisions by the application of
the same basic planning criteria; and
   (g)    To provide for the coordination of planning and division of land in
connection with planned development areas to carry out the objectives of the
Master Plan. (Ord. 1991-18. Passed 5-12-92.)
   1111.02 TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL FEATURES.
   Land developments shall be planned to preserve the topography of the land in
order to utilize the natural contours and reduce the amount of grading and to
minimize destruction of trees, wetlands and natural drainageways. The natural
features and other distinctive characteristics of the site shall be integrated
into the plan to create functional elements in the neighborhoods. Detailed
topographic maps and aerial photography shall be utilized in the land planning
and subdivision process.
   (a)    Streets and Topography. Land which is relatively flat or of very
gentle undulations shall be planned so that the streets follow the natural
drainage courses and, insofar as possible, all building sites shall be above
the street grade. On more irregular topography, streets should follow the
ridges or be planned approximately parallel to contour lines and designed to
avoid extensive cuts and fills.
   (b)    Natural Drainage. All developments, particularly of land of very
gentle slopes, shall be designed to take advantage of natural contours so that
all the land can be drained with the minimum of reshaping. Unless water courses
or drainage ways are enclosed, the plan shall be adjusted so that rear lot
lines or areas held as public or private common land shall be approximately
parallel to the natural watercourse, and only where such a plan is not
practical, may side lot lines be arranged parallel to an open drainage course.
Easements for drainage ways and low-lying areas which are subject to flooding
may be included as part of the lot but shall not be utilized as a building
site. If a watercourse traverses the development at any point, the following
language shall be inserted on the preliminary plan and final plat and signed by
the property owner(s):
         "WATERCOURSE ACCEPTANCE. It is understood and agreed that a
watercourse traverses this subdivision and these properties may be subject to
erosion and drainage problems as a result, and all property owners, their
successors and assigns, by the acceptance hereof, hereby acknowledge the same,
and assume the risk thereof, and agree to indemnify and hold the City of
Independence harmless from any and all claims for erosion and drainage problems
from said watercourse."
      In addition, all deeds purporting to convey a parcel that is located
partly or wholly in a floodplain area shall contain a statement in bold-face
type setting forth that fact.
   (c)    Natural Features. Natural wooded areas, rock outcroppings, streams
and other focal points within the site and distant views outside the
subdivision shall be coordinated with the design to obtain natural variety and
interest in each neighborhood and the most attractive building sites and views
possible. Trees, topsoil and other natural resources shall be preserved and
utilized in the development of the subdivision. Certain required dimensions may
be adjusted to preserve such features when approved in accordance with the
provisions of the Subdivision Code and the Zoning Code.
   (d)    Wetlands. All wetland areas characterized by hydrophytic vegetation,
hydric soils, and wetland hydrology found within any development area shall be
maintained to eliminate any further destruction of such wetlands area.
   (e)    Trees. A developer of an unimproved lot in any district shall submit
with his preliminary plan application a photograph of the lot to be developed
taken from the street and such other photographs or drawings as may be required
to display the trees on the site. A site plan submitted with the application
shall locate each tree with a trunk more than thirteen inches in circumference
measured at a point thirty-six inches above ground level, and shall indicate
those trees which the applicant requests permission to remove. The Planning
Commission may require an adjustment to the site plan to prevent the
unnecessary destruction of trees. No such trees other than those permitted to
be removed may be removed during construction or thereafter outside of the area
of actual construction, without the permission of the Planning Commission,
unless the tree constitutes a nuisance by reason of disease or injury.
      (Ord. 1991-18. Passed 5-12-92.)
   1111.03 ARTERIAL AND COLLECTOR STREETS.
   Streets shall be designated to implement the Street Plan, to be in accord
with the function served as classified in Section
1107.19 and to be related to the use of abutting land. Furthermore, streets
shall be designed to comply with planning criteria as follows:
   (a)    The Arterial Street System. The arterial street system shall be
planned in compliance with the duly adopted Street Plan, and, unless shown
otherwise on such Plan, arterial streets shall be planned for continuation of
existing streets in the system and at the same width or at greater width in
accordance with adopted standards. Access to arterial streets shall be
controlled in the interest of public safety and in order to maintain the design
capacity of the street system. Arterial streets should be planned to have a
minimum distance of 600 to 800 feet between intersections. Access driveways to
developments and sublots between intersecting streets should be regulated
insofar as possible to one driveway at intervals of 200 feet. This may be
accomplished by combining the access to several developments or by other means.
   (b)    The Collector Street System. Collector streets connect the local
residential street system and the arterial street system and should be oriented
to one or more focal points of traffic generation. They should be planned for
continuity and will normally contain a number of intersections with local
streets.
   (c)    Relation to Residential Developments. Whenever a one family
residential development abuts an arterial street, the Commission may, in order
to protect residential property from the movements of heavy traffic and to
control intersections with arterial streets, require:
      (1)    Marginal streets parallel to the arterial streets;
      (2)    Reverse frontage lots between an arterial street and a parallel
local street with screen planting located on a non-access reservation along the
right- of-way line of the arterial street;
      (3)    The fronting of lots with extra width on perpendicular local
streets; or
      (4)    Lots with extra depth fronting on the arterial street with access
provided by combined driveways.
   (d)    Right-of-Way Widths. The right of way for arterial streets shall be
determined by the Planning Commission and Engineer but in no case shall the
right of way be less than eighty feet. The right of way for collector streets
shall be not less than seventy feet.
      (Ord. 1991-18. Passed 5-12-92.)
   1111.04 LOCAL STREET PATTERN IN RESIDENTIAL AREA.
   The primary function of local streets is to provide direct access to each
lot of the development area. The local street system should be designed to
minimize through traffic movements. This should be accomplished by peripheral
collector street design, by offsetting local street intersections and by
providing loop streets or cul-de-sac streets. Every part of a residential area
should, however, be interconnected for convenience and to avoid excessive
indirect travel except where connections are not feasible because of
topographic conditions.
   The pattern should be logical and comprehensive for the convenience of the
local residents, visitors and for providing services. The design should be
planned to provide these basic functions without relying on excessive traffic
regulations. The streets should be designed for uniformly low volumes of
traffic commensurate with residential amenities, and to discourage speeds of
more than twenty-five miles per hour.
   There shall be a basic underlying street design related to topography and
other natural features. The pattern should also be related to attaining
functional, economical and practical patterns, and shapes and sizes of areas
for development. Necessary traffic generators such as schools and playgrounds
should serve as focal points in the pattern. There should be a minimum number
of intersections and T-intersections should predominate.
   (a)    Right-of-Way and Pavement Widths. Whenever local streets are planned
in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section, the right-of-way
width of such street shall be sixty feet and the pavement width between curbs
shall be twenty-six feet. The Commission, however, may approve a right-of-way
width of fifty feet, and a pavement width of twenty-four feet for cul-de-sac
streets serving less than fifteen dwelling units or a loop street serving less
than thirty dwelling units.
   (b)    Intersections. Streets shall be designed to intersect as nearly at
ninety degrees as possible; no street shall intersect another at less than
seventy degrees. The intersection of more than two streets at one point or with
centerline offsets of less than 200 feet shall not be permitted. The vertical
alignment or grade within 100 feet of an intersection should not exceed three
percent (3%). An unobstructed "site triangle" of not less than seventy-five
feet measured along the centerlines of the intersecting streets shall be
provided. Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius
of not less than thirty feet for arterial streets, twenty feet for collector
and local streets.
   (c)    Vertical Alignment.  The maximum grade for local streets should not
exceed eight percent (8%). Grades exceeding eight percent (8%) shall be
permitted for only short distances of approximately 200 feet. A rate of change
of three percent (3%) to four percent (4%) per 100 feet is the maximum
recommended to provide a safe sight distance.
      (Ord. 1991-18.  Passed 5-12-92.)
   (d)    Horizontal Alignment.  Properly designed curving residential streets
are encouraged; angles of horizontal alignment of the centerlines of streets
shall be connected by a curve with radius of not less than 150 feet; between
reverse curves there shall be centerline tangent of not less than 100 feet.
      (Ord. 2007-14.  Passed 3-13-07.)
   (e)    Cul-de-sac Streets. Cul-de-sac streets shall be permitted where
parcels are surrounded by development, where irregular topography would require
excessive grading for continuous streets, or where other types of non-through
streets would not provide sufficient discouragement of through traffic. All
cul-de-sac streets shall be terminated with a permanent turnaround having a
minimum curb radius of fifty feet and a street property line radius of sixty-
five feet. If the cul-de-sac street does not open in the direction of schools
or playgrounds, a pedestrian accessway may be required. In addition, the
Commission may require that the center of the turnaround be landscaped with
appropriate plant material.
   (f)    Temporary Dead-End Streets. Where a proposed subdivision adjoins
undeveloped land, a temporary "T" turnaround may be provided for each abutting
street if approved by the Engineer. Provisions shall be made for the future
extension of such streets and utilities and for the reversion of the access
right-of-way to the abutting properties.
   (g)    Streets of Nonconforming Width. Streets of less than the required
width shall not be permitted except where the Commission finds such a street
will be adequate to serve the proposed development. Wherever property abuts a
street which does not conform to the width required by the Street Plan, the
Subdivision Code, or plans of the County or Ohio Department of Transportation,
the additional width shall be provided when the land is subdivided.
   (h)    Reserve Strips Adjoining Streets. A division of land to prevent
access or extensions to pavement or utilities to another property shall not be
permitted except where the control and provisions for disposal of such land
division has been assigned to the City.
   (i)    Driveways. Driveways shall be located at least seventy- five feet
from the intersection of the projection of the right-of-way lines of the
nearest intersecting streets.
   (j)    Street Names. Names shall be selected which will not duplicate or be
confused with the names of existing streets in the City irrespective of
modifying terms such as street, avenue, boulevard, etc. An attempt should be
made, however, not to duplicate street names within the County. Streets that
are or will eventually be continuations of existing or platted streets shall be
named the same except as otherwise determined by the Planning Commission.
Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.
      (Ord. 1991-18. Passed 5-12-92.)
   1111.05 STREETS FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS.
   (a)    Streets serving business developments and accessory parking areas
shall be planned to connect with arterial streets in order not to generate
traffic on local residential streets. The intersection of service streets or
driveways from parking areas with arterial or collector streets shall be
located in order to cause the least possible interference with the movement of
traffic on the arterial streets, and wherever possible shall be located not
less than 100 feet from the intersection of an arterial or collector street,
measured from the intersection of the projection of the right-of-way lines and
shall be spaced not less than 200 feet from each other.
   (b)    Parking areas serving adjoining business establishments shall be
interconnected by on-site drives where possible and designed to provide maximum
safety and convenience, and, to accomplish such purposes, the Commission may
require marginal service roads along arterial streets.
(Ord. 1991-18. Passed 5-12-92.)
   1111.06 STREETS FOR INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   Collector streets for industrial subdivisions shall be planned to serve
industrial areas exclusively and shall connect with arterial streets so that no
industrial traffic will be directed onto any residential streets. The
intersections of service streets and access driveways to parking areas with
arterial streets should be located at intervals of not less than 200 feet in
the interest of public safety and to maintain the design capacity of the
street.
   The street layout of the industrial subdivision shall be planned to provide
the lot areas and widths as required in the Zoning Code; it may be planned for
progressive extension as the subdivision is developed. The street plan shall be
in general conformity with plans for the development of the adjoining
industrial areas and the adopted Street Plan. Streets shall be planned to be
extended to the boundaries of any adjoining land planned for industry, except
for topographic or other physical conditions; or if the Commission finds such
extension is not in accord with the approved plan of the area. In such
locations the Commission may permit a cul-de-sac street as a temporary measure
as part of a progressive development program.
   The minimum pavement width shall be thirty-two feet; the minimum radius of
curbs at intersections shall be thirty-five feet; the minimum right of way
shall be not less than seventy feet. Each street shall be of sufficient width
to safely accommodate the projected traffic volumes and access for fire
protection equipment. The pavement turn-around shall have a minimum outside
curb radius of fifty-five feet and a property line radius of at least sixty-
five feet. The criteria for horizontal and vertical alignment, intersections
and other design criteria shall be the same as set forth in this chapter for
collector streets.
(Ord. 1967-37. Passed 1-9-68.)
   1111.07 DESIGN OF BLOCKS.
   The boundaries and lines of blocks and other parts of neighborhoods shall be
designed and adjusted to conform to the topography and natural features, to the
corporation lines, to the street planning criteria as set forth in Section
1111.04, to accommodate lots and building sites of the size and character
required for the district as set forth in the Zoning Code and to provide for
the required community facilities.
   (a)    Size of Blocks. For one-family subdivisions, the length of blocks
shall be planned not to exceed 2,500 feet or be less than 800 feet unless
otherwise approved by the Commission. The width of blocks shall be planned to
accommodate two tiers of lots. A single tier of lots may, however, be required
by the Commission to separate residential development from major streets as set
forth in Section
1111.03, from adjoining nonresidential land uses and from areas of unusual
topographic or natural features. Tiers of lots may be separated by common green
areas.
   (b)    Pedestrian Circulation. Pedestrian ways of not less than twenty feet
in width may be required for walkways across excessively long blocks or at the
end of cul-de-sac streets for access to schools, playgrounds, or to other
public facilities where convenient pedestrian circulation has not been provided
by the street pattern. (Ord. 1991-18. Passed 5-12-92.)
   1111.08 DESIGN OF LOTS.
   Each lot shall be designed to form a functional site for the type of
dwelling and the ancillary open space, and the lot lines shall not be
considered as merely a geometric shape enclosing the minimum requirements. The
lots shall generally be rectangular in form; triangular, elongated or other
shapes that restrict its use as a building site and the utilization of yards
shall be avoided.
   (a)    Area and Width of Lot.  In residential subdivisions, the area and
width of lots shall be in accordance with the requirements set forth in the
Zoning Code, which requirements shall be construed as absolute minimum and not
as optimum dimensions. The width of lot shall be not less than required at the
front yard building line; on curved streets, and cul-de-sac streets, the arc of
the front lot line or rear lot line shall be at least sixty percent (60%) of
the lots’ width at the building line, but not less than sixty feet.
      (Ord. 2007-08.  Passed 3-13-07.)
   (b)    Depth of Lots. The depth of lots abutting a local street in a
proposed one-family subdivision should not exceed three and one-half times its
width. This ratio shall be increased when the rear line of such lots abuts a
railroad, a freeway, other nonresidential land uses or where the rear yard
contains rugged topography. Lots abutting major streets may exceed the
aforesaid depth ratio as set forth in Section
1111.03 in order to increase the safety and privacy thereon. The City may
prepare a local street plan of partially subdivided areas and reserve openings
at intervals along the major roads for future local streets to serve the
interior areas in accordance with duly adopted mapped street procedures.
   (c)    Corner Lots. In one-family subdivisions, corner lots shall have extra
width to obtain the required side yards and building setbacks from and to
obtain appropriate orientation to both streets and as set forth in the Zoning
Code.
   (d)    Side Lot Lines. In one-family subdivisions, side lot lines shall be
designed in order to be at approximately right angles to street lines or radial
to curved street lines. Where a street intersects another to form a "T"
intersection, the side lot lines shall be planned so that one line will be
located approximately on the projected centerline of the street which
terminates at the "T".
      (Ord. 1991-18. Passed 5-12-92.)
   1111.09 PUBLIC USES.
   The subdivision regulations shall aid in the implementation of the Community
Facilities Plan as follows:
   (a)    Sites for Community Facilities. Sites for parks, playgrounds, schools
and other public uses shall be shown on the duly adopted Community Facilities
Plan. Drainage courses, ponds, lakes, wetland areas or isolated parcels shall
not be accepted for public use and maintenance unless conforming with the plan
for public lands.
   (b)    Utility Easements. Where utilities are not located in the street,
easements where necessary at least twelve feet total width shall be located as
directed by the City Engineer in a form approved by the Law Director.
   (c)    Drainage Ways. Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainage way,
channel or stream, a storm water easement or drainage right of way conforming
substantially with the lines of such watercourse shall be established and
conveyed or dedicated to the City. Such easements shall be not less than twenty
feet wide, exclusive of the required lot area, or of such further width as
deemed adequate for the purpose. Rear lot lines should be planned along such
drainage ways. (Ord. 1991-18. Passed 5-12-92.)
   1111.10 MAN-MADE FEATURES.
   (a)    All developments shall be designed to acknowledge any traversing or
nearby electric transmission lines. If an electric transmission line traverses
a development at any point, the following language shall be inserted on the
preliminary plan and final plat and signed by the property owner(s):
      "TRANSMISSION LINE ACCEPTANCE. It is understood and acknowledged that an
electric transmission line(s) traverses this subdivision and that these
properties may be subject to electromagnetic fields from said lines. As a
result, all property owners, their successors and assigns, by the acceptance
hereof, hereby acknowledge same and agree to indemnify and hold the City of
Independence harmless from any and all claims from said electric transmission
line(s)."
   (b)    For purposes of this section, an "electric transmission line" is
defined as a line or associated facility having a design capacity of 125
kilovolts or more. In addition, all deeds purporting to convey a parcel that is
located partly or wholly in a development area shall contain a statement in
bold-faced type setting forth that fact.

   1113.01 INTENT.
   Provisions for requiring improvements are hereby established to be applied
to each proposed subdivision and resubdivision for designing, constructing and
assuring the construction of land improvements in order to achieve, among
others, the following purposes:
   (a)    That the natural site assets such as existing trees and topsoil shall
be preserved and the site graded to the extent necessary to provide a system of
drainage;
   (b)    That all on-site and off-site extensions of pavements and utilities
be constructed to complete the street and utility system;
   (c)    That the City be assured all required improvements be constructed for
the entire project, or for a progressive series of parts thereof; and
   (d)    To provide measures for enforcement thereof by withholding recording
and transfer of land until the construction is satisfactorily completed.
      (Ord. 1967-37. Passed 1-9-68.)
   1113.02 IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
   The developer shall provide and install at his expense the improvements
required herein, or he shall provide financial guarantees in lieu of actual
installation precedent to the recording and sale of lots and the issuance of
building permits. For industrial subdivisions, the Commission may, however,
permit the improvements to be installed on an assessment basis.
   (a)    Improvements Within the Subdivision. Land for rights of way for all
local and collector streets within the subdivision and land for the widening or
extension of arterial streets on the boundary of any proposed subdivision shall
be dedicated by the developer, and all easements shall be provided.
      Utilities and pavements shall be furnished and installed as hereinafter
required, and they shall be of such sizes and capacities as are required for
the development of the proposed subdivision and as may be necessary to serve
adjacent undeveloped land which is an integral part of the service area. The
developer may be required to extend improvements to the boundary of the
proposed subdivision to serve adjoining unsubdivided land. Where the Commission
determines that a connecting street is necessary for the future subdividing of
adjoining land but the present construction of pavement or utilities therein is
not warranted, the Commission may require the dedication of land for such
connecting street and the pavement for the intersections constructed and
connections to the utilities made available for future extension.
   (b)    Off-Site Extensions. The construction of off-site improvements to
serve a proposed subdivision may be required of the developer as a precedent to
approval if adequate utilities or streets are not available at the boundary of
the proposed subdivision, provided the Commission finds the extension of the
improvements across undeveloped or unserved areas would not be warranted as a
special assessment to the intervening properties or a municipal expense until
some future date. When improvements installed by a developer would also serve
or benefit abutting or adjacent property, Council may restrict the use of such
improvements until equitable repayment of the cost thereof is made to the
developer. (Ord. 1967-37. Passed l-9-68.)
   1113.03 GRADING.
   The developer shall prepare a grading plan for each subdivision in order to
establish street grades, floor elevations of buildings and a system of drainage
for private lots, all in proper relation to each other and to existing
topography, as follows:
   (a)    Grading of Block. The grading plan for the block shall be in
accordance with the criteria set forth in Section
1111.02. The purposes are: to divert water away from buildings, to prevent
standing water and soil saturation detrimental to buildings and the use of the
lot, to provide for disposal of water from the lot except that which should be
retained for irrigation, to preserve desirable site features and to provide
grades for safe and convenient access to and around buildings and the lot for
their use and maintenance. The finished grading shall be designed in accordance
with the chapter on Lot Improvements, details 88 through 91, of the FHA Minimum
Property Standards for One and Two Living Units.
         The grading of the roadway shall be in accordance with the criteria
set forth in Section
1111.02, and extend the full width of the right of way except in rolling
topography. Tree lawns should be graded at a gradient of not less than two
percent or more than four percent upward from the curb to the sidewalk or
property line.
   (b)    Lot Grading. The floor elevation of each building shall be
established in proper relation to the surrounding grades, to the driveway and
the street. There should be a minimum grade of two percent around each building
so that water drains to lower areas or drainage swales which shall have a
minimum grade of 0.5 percent. The lot drainage system shall be designed so that
there is both front and rear yard drainage and drains so that surface water
will drain onto the driveway, a drainage structure or structures on the lot, a
street gutter and storm sewer or a natural drainage way.
      The minimum grades of driveways shall be 0.5 percent, the maximum shall
be twelve percent. Grading should be adjusted so there will be no abrupt grades
in the front yards and along side lot lines. The grades of earth terraces shall
not exceed a two and one-half to one slope. If a masonry retaining wall exceeds
three feet in height, a hedge, fence or railing shall be provided on it.
   (c)    Topsoil and Trees. The topsoil shall be stripped from the roadway and
construction areas, piled separately and not removed from the site or used as
spoil. The Commission may require that as many trees as can be reasonably
utilized in the final development plan be retained, and the grading be adjusted
to the existing grade around the trees.
      (Ord. 1973-68. Passed 9-25-73.)
   1113.04 DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   A drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the developer, as
required for the district in which the proposed subdivision is located, for the
proper drainage of the surface water of the subdivision and each lot as
follows:
   (a)    Enclosed Storm Sewer. An enclosed storm sewer system shall be
provided and connected to an existing storm sewer system, drainage ditch or
other waterway as determined by the Engineer. The system shall have a capacity
to serve the subdivision and drainage area of which it is a part. The system
shall include pipes, culverts, manholes, catch basins, drain inlets and a
connection for each lot.
   (b)    Open Drainage System. Subject to the approval of Council and the
Engineer, the developer may rechannel any watercourse through his property in
order to contain the storm drain flow within a lesser width. The developer may
be required to deed in fee, dedicate or grant an easement to the City for a
drainage channel not less in width than required by a plan or standards adopted
by Council or as directed by the Engineer. The developer shall be responsible
for clearing the drainage way of all debris as a condition of acceptance. The
Engineer shall determine the proper cross section, grade, width of channel and
horizontal alignment.
   (c)    Design Standards. The drainage system shall be designed in accordance
with standards set by the Engineer.
   (d)   All new residential construction, including additions and alterations
to existing residential dwellings, shall include an inlet basin drainage system
where the City Engineer determines that a lot cannot contain its own storm
water runoff and said runoff is likely to impact adjoining lots.  Said drainage
system shall be constructed in the rear yard or wherever dictated by the
topography of the lot.
      In new residential subdivisions, the developer shall be required to
install the drainage system as part of the subdivision’s major storm system. 
Should the construction of the drainage system substantially alter existing
wooded areas and the inlet basin can be tied into the downspout system for the
lot, then the property owner shall be required to construct the inlet basin
with a connection to said downspout.  (Ord. 1999-16.  Passed 3-9-99.)
   1113.05 SANITARY FACILITIES.
   When trunk sewers and sewage treatment facilities are available, sanitary
sewers shall be designed in accordance with the Master Sewer Plan of the City,
and constructed by the developer of each proposed subdivision or development; a
house connection shall be provided for each lot. The sanitary system shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with such regulations and standards as
may be established by the Engineer. In the absence of sanitary sewers and
treatment facilities, septic tanks, filter beds and satisfactory drainage of
effluent shall be provided for as required by the County Board of Health and
the City Building Commissioner. (Ord. 1967-37. Passed 1-9-68.)
   1113.06 WATER SUPPLY.
   A public water system shall be designed and constructed by the developer of
each subdivision or development and a supply shall be provided for each lot.
The water distribution system shall be designed and constructed in accordance
with the rules and standards as may be established by the Engineer or the
Division of Water and Heat of the City of Cleveland.
(Ord. 1967-37. Passed 1-9-68.)
   1113.07 ELECTRIC AND TELEPHONE SERVICE.
   The developer shall submit preliminary plans of proposed subdivisions to the
utility companies which will service the subdivision for the preparation of a
layout of their distribution system.
   In all new major subdivisions and all new minor subdivisions which are
adjoining and fronting on the same street as a subdivision in which underground
communication, electric power and street lighting distribution systems are in
place, it shall be required that all telephone, electric power and street
lighting wires, conduits or cables, along with equipment and housing necessary
in the distribution system to serve lots in such subdivision, shall be
constructed underground and upon easements provided for utilities, except that
those wires, conduits or cables owned by or serving individual customers and
located wholly on the customer's property, need not be located upon easements.
   (a)    Underground Electric Service. The recorded plat for the subdivision
shall contain utility easements ten feet in width for all required
communication, electric power and street lighting distribution lines, equipment
and its housing. All underground telephone, electric power and street lighting
wires, conduits or cables and transformers shall be installed in accordance
with the standards required in Administrative Order No. 72 and other applicable
regulations of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Transformers shall be
located in underground vaults under the public walk or in an approved location
in a nearby easement.
      The developer shall make arrangements to have gas mains installed and
shall submit drawings to the Engineer for approval.
   (b)    Overhead Electric Service. Where permitted in business and industrial
areas, overhead electric and telephone service lines should be located in
easements along interior lot lines, and occasionally on a side lot line, in
order to keep the number of poles along streets to a minimum. In order to allow
a reasonable minimum clearance from structures and adjacent trees, easements
should be six feet wide on each parcel, total minimum width twelve feet.
Easements should be continuous from block to block, and in some blocks ingress
only may be necessary. Street lighting wires shall be extended along side lot
lines to lighting standards along the street rights of way.
   (c)    Street Lighting System. In subdivisions served by underground
electric service, provisions shall be made for the ultimate installation of
street lighting standards on local streets by the electric utility serving the
subdivision spaced no farther apart than every fourth lot.
      Provisions shall be made for the ultimate installation of street lighting
standards on arterial and collector streets by the electric utility serving the
subdivision to provide lighting intensity meeting the minimum recommendations
of American Standard Practice for Roadway Lighting.
      Until used, the wiring so provided shall be safely insulated and de-
energized.
      (Ord. 1967-37. Passed 1-9-68.)
   1113.08 GAS FUEL SERVICE.
   The developer shall submit plans for a gas fuel distribution system for the
proposed subdivision or development and a supply provided for each lot. The gas
system shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the rules and
standards of the East Ohio Gas Company as approved by the City.
(Ord. 1967-37. Passed 1-9-68.)
   1113.09 PAVEMENT, CURBS AND SIDEWALKS.
   The pavement, curbs and sidewalks shall be designed and constructed by the
developer as required for the district in which the subdivision is located and
set forth in the schedules in the Subdivision Code and in the Street and
Sidewalk Code of the City.
   (a)    Pavement. The width of the pavement shall be measured between the
vertical faces of straight curbs and the outside edges of rolled curbs. The
materials and the construction shall be in accordance with the Detailed
Specifications as required by the Engineer and Material Specifications of the
Ohio Highway Department whichever is applicable. The pavement requirements may
be modified, if found necessary by the Engineer and if approved by the
Commission, because of extraordinary traffic loads or unusual soil conditions
in specific locations.
      After the underground utilities and house connections are installed and
backfilled and rough grading completed, the roadway subgrade shall be shaped,
rolled and compacted. The developer may construct the final pavement of
reinforced concrete with integral curbs. The developer may also request that he
construct a temporary pavement of slag or stone for use during the building
construction period and furnish a cash bond of at least ten percent of the
amount of the performance bond or in other amounts mutually agreed upon,
guaranteeing that all pavements shall be maintained in a passable and
reasonable condition and rebuilt as necessary to comply with the standards of
the City at the completion of the construction of the buildings, and without
expense to the City, until acceptance of final pavement for maintenance and
use.
   (b)    Curbs and Gutters. Concrete roll curbs integral with the pavement
shall be constructed as required in the district where the subdivision is
located. Concrete roll curbs and gutters shall be in accordance with the
Detailed Specifications as required by the Engineer. Straight curbs may be
provided at intersections where rolled curbs are used elsewhere.
(Ord. 1967-37. Passed 1-9-68.)
   (c)    Driveways and Curb Cuts. Driveways and curb cuts should be located
along the lowest side of the lot, not less than three feet from the side lot
line or another driveway. Driveways shall be not less than eight feet and not
more than twenty feet wide in single-family districts. Curb cuts for straight
curbs, and the flare for rolled curbs of driveways shall be three to five feet
wider than the driveway pavement on each side; the driveway grade of the apron
shall not exceed three percent from the edge of the pavement to the property
line and the maximum grade of the on-site driveway shall not exceed fifteen
percent.
(Ord. 2003-42. Passed 12-9-03.)
   (d)    Parking Areas. The design of off-street parking areas and their
service driveways shall be in accordance with the standards as set forth in the
Zoning Code.
   (e)    Public Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of the
street; however, the Commission may waive this requirement in certain
residential districts for cul-de-sac streets serving less than fifteen dwelling
units or for loop streets serving less than thirty dwelling units. Walks shall
be extended to connect with existing walks or to the boundaries of the
subdivision if walks are not accessible.
      On local residential streets, sidewalks shall be located in the public
right of way so that the inner line is approximately six inches from the
property line. On corner lots each sidewalk shall be extended to the curb. In
residential developments walks shall be not less than five feet wide and not
less than ten feet wide in business developments.
      Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete four inches thick. The design
and construction shall be in accord with the standards established by the
Engineer.
      (Ord. 1967-37. Passed 1-9-68.)
   1113.10 MONUMENTS.
   Monument boxes shall consist of an adjustable cast-iron monument box No. R-
1968, Type "B" as manufactured by Neenah Foundry Company, or an approved equal.
Monument boxes shall be set at all points in the pavement indicated on the
plans. These shall be located so as to conform to the line and grades as shown
on the plans and standard detailed drawings for pavements in the City.
(Ord. 1967-37. Passed 1-9-68.)
   1113.11 STREET TREES.
   (a)   Street trees shall be required in each proposed subdivision or
resubdivision and provisions in accordance therewith shall be made for one
street tree per subdivision lot.  The City shall select, space and plant the
street trees and the developer shall pay to the City one hundred twenty-five
dollars ($125.00) per lot for street trees prior to the issuance of any
building permit.
 
   (b)   In the selection and spacing of trees, the City shall be guided by a
street tree plan reviewed by the Commission and trees selected should be at
least six to eight feet in height and one inch in diameter.  (Ord. 2000-58. 
Passed 9-12-00.)
   1113.12 STREET NAME SIGNS.
   Street name signs shall be furnished and installed by the developer. The
design of the signs shall be in accord with the present signs as approved by
Council. Signs shall be placed on diagonally opposite corners, on the far right
hand of the intersection for traffic on the more important street and as close
to the corner as possible.
(Ord. 1967-37. Passed 1-9-68.)
   1113.13 EXTRA-SIZE AND OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS.
   The utilities, pavements and other land improvements as required shall be
designed of extra size and extensions provided as may be necessary to serve
nearby land which is an integral part of the neighborhood service or drainage
area in addition to the improvements required for the development of the
proposed subdivision.
   (a)    Extra-Size Improvements. The developer shall be required to pay a
part of the improvements but shall not be required to pay for that part of the
materials or construction of the pavements of arterial streets, trunk sewers or
water mains which are determined by the Engineer, according to standards set
forth in this chapter, to be in excess of the size required for the development
of the subdivision and the integral neighborhood, service or drainage area.
      If a storm sewer, a sanitary sewer or a water main in excess of the size
necessary to service the development is required, the City may construct the
extra-size utility and require a deposit in advance from the developer for the
cost of the utility he is required to install and his portion of other costs
which the City may assess against the benefited property owners of the service
or drainage area.
   (b)    Extensions to Boundaries. The developer shall be required to extend
the necessary improvements to the boundary of the proposed subdivision to serve
adjoining unsubdivided land, as determined by the Commission.
   (c)    Off-Site Extensions. If streets or utilities are not available at the
boundary of a proposed subdivision, and if the Commission finds the extensions
across undeveloped areas would not be warranted as a special assessment to the
intervening properties or as a municipal expense until some future time, the
developer may be required, prior to approval of the final plat, to obtain
necessary easements or rights of way and construct and pay for such extensions.
Such improvements shall be available for connections by developers of adjoining
land.
   (d)    Prorating Costs. In making determinations for prorating costs for the
construction of off-site extensions or extra-size improvements, the Commission
and Council shall consider in addition to the standards set forth in this
chapter and other regulations of the City, the following conditions:
      (1)    The relative location and size of the proposed subdivision;

health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. The lot or yard areas
required by this Zoning Code for a particular building shall not be diminished

other building. The lot or yard areas of buildings existing at the time of the
passage of this Zoning Code shall not be diminished below the requirements
herein provided for buildings hereafter erected and such required areas shall
not be included as a part of the required areas of any building hereafter
erected. This Zoning Code shall not repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way
impair or interfere with any existing provisions of law or ordinance or any
rules or regulations previously adopted or issued or which shall be adopted or
issued pursuant to law relating to the use of buildings or premises, nor shall
this Zoning Code interfere with, abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or
other agreements between parties; provided, however, that where this Zoning
Code imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or premises or
upon the height or size of buildings or requires larger yards than are imposed
or required by such existing provisions of law or ordinance or by such rules,
regulations or by such easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions of
this Zoning Code shall control.

established. Every such proposed amendment shall be referred by Council to the
Planning Commission for report. Any such amendment that has failed to receive
the approval of the Planning Commission shall not be passed by Council except
by the affirmative vote of at least five members of Council. If a protest
against such amendment is presented duly signed and acknowledged by the owners
of twenty percent of the land within such area proposed to be altered, such
amendment shall not be passed except by a three-fourths vote of Council. If
such amendment will transfer an area to a less restrictive use, height or area
district and a protest is presented duly signed and acknowledged by the owners
of the twenty percent of the land adjacent to and within 200 feet from such
area proposed to be transferred and within a more restricted use, height or
area district than the district in which such area is proposed to be
transferred, such amendment shall not be passed except by a three-fourths vote
of Council. Whenever the owners of fifty percent of the land in any area shall
present a petition duly signed and acknowledged to Council requesting an
amendment of the regulations prescribed for such area, it shall be the duty of
Council to vote upon such amendment within ninety days of the filing of same by
the petitioners with the Clerk of Council. If any area is hereafter transferred
to another district by a change in the district boundaries by amendment as
provided in this section, the provisions of this Zoning Code with regard to
buildings or premises existing at the time of the passage of this Zoning Code
shall apply to buildings or premises existing in such transferred area at the
time of the passage of such amendment.

1997-21. Passed 5-13-97.)
   1144.02 INTENT.
   Wireless telecommunications facilities are permitted in “T-1" Districts and
as conditional uses in Commercial (U-5), Industrial (U-6), Light Manufacturing
(U-5A) or Motor Service (U-6A) districts contingent upon a number of specific
conditions and requirements being met.  These regulations are established to
ensure that telecommunications facilities will be developed and maintained in a
manner which provides adequate telecommunication services to the community
while protecting and minimizing any adverse safety, public welfare or visual
impact through buffering, siting, design and construction, and reducing the
need for new towers. 
(Ord. 2003-11.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1144.03 USE REGULATIONS.
   (a)    General Standards. This section applies to all wireless
telecommunications facilities independent of the zoning district in which they
are to be located. These general standards are to be supplemented with the
provisions for the particular applications specified in subsections (b) and (c)
hereof which follow.
      (1)    Location.
         A.    No new wireless communications tower will be allowed within a
two thousand five hundred (2,500) foot radius of an existing wireless tower.
The Planning Commission may waive this requirement with the approval of Council
for the purpose of the clustering of towers so long as the towers are visually
compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.
         B.    The location of the tower and equipment building shall comply
with all natural resource protection standards established in this chapter
including floodplain, wetlands and steep slope regulations.
         C.    A tower may not be located on a building or structure that is
listed on an historic register, or is in an historic district.
      (2)    Area. A minimum lot area of one (1) acre shall be required for a
tower. In addition, lot area shall be sufficient to provide for all
requirements of setbacks, yards, and building coverage as specified in the
underlying zoning district.
      (3)    Tower type. Monopole or lattice wireless communication towers,
which do not utilize guy wires, and their associated supporting buildings shall
be allowed in the City. A wireless telecommunications tower which is supported
by guy wires shall only be permitted if the applicant can prove that a monopole
or lattice tower not requiring guy wires is not reasonably feasible, due to
non-economic reasons, such as specific site conditions, or is required to
provide wireless communications to a specific area that cannot be served by a
guyless monopole tower. In the event guy wires are required to support the
wireless telecommunications tower, the guy wires shall be considered part of
the wireless telecommunications facility and shall meet all setback and yard
requirements.
      (4)    Tower design.  A Tower shall be designed to have sufficient
structural capacity to allow for at least three (3) additional providers to be
located on the structure when constructed to the maximum allowable height.
Towers and antenna shall be designed to withstand sustained winds of at least
100 miles per hour with one-half (½) inch of icing. The wireless  communication
facility shall also be designed to show that the applicant has enough space on
its site for an equipment building large enough to accommodate at least three
(3) additional providers. If the equipment building is  initially constructed
to accommodate only one user, space shall be reserved on-site for equipment
building expansion to accommodate up to at least three (3) additional
providers.
      (5)    Equipment shelters/buildings. Underground equipment shelters are
encouraged especially in non-industrial districts, and may be requested by the
Planning Commission. In the event of co-location, all additional wireless
telecommunications equipment shelters shall either be shared with all other
providers utilizing the wireless telecommunications facility, or in the event
such facility sharing is not feasible, any additional wireless
telecommunications equipment shelters shall be attached to any existing shelter
and shall be constructed of similar materials and utilize a design similar to
any existing shelter located on such a property.
      (6)    Fencing. A security fence eight feet in height with barbed wire
around the top shall completely surround the tower, equipment building and any
guy wires.
      (7)    Buffer. Required buffer plantings shall be determined by the City
Planner and the following minimum plantings shall be located around the
perimeter of the security fence:
         A.    A landscaped buffer area of not less than fifteen (15) feet in
depth shall be placed between the wireless telecommunication facilities and the
public rights-of-way and any adjacent properties from which a direct view can
be had of the facilities, other than the tower itself.
         B.    The fifteen (15) foot landscaped buffer area shall consist of an
evergreen screen of either a solid six (6) foot hedge, or a row of evergreen
trees planted and spaced no more than ten (10) feet apart. These trees and
shrubs shall be planted in any configuration which will best serve to buffer
the site.
         C.    Existing vegetation (trees and shrubs) shall be preserved to the
maximum extent possible.
      (8)    Compatibility.
         A.    To the maximum extent possible, the entire facility must be
aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the environment. The use of
residentially compatible exterior materials such as wood, brick, or stucco is
required for associated equipment buildings, which shall be designed to
architecturally match the exterior of structures within the neighborhood. In no
case will metal or concrete block exteriors be allowed for accessory buildings.
         B.    The tower itself must be of such design and treated with an
architectural material so that it is camouflaged or blends in with surrounding
uses so as to be visually compatible with the neighborhood. The tower shall be
painted a non-contrasting gray or similar color minimizing its visibility,
unless otherwise required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
      (9)    Co-location. No new wireless communication facility may be erected
if there is a technically suitable space for a wireless communication facility
available on an existing wireless communication tower within the applicant's
search area in which the new wireless communication antenna is to be located.
With the permit application, the applicant shall list the location of every
tower, building or structure that could support the proposed antenna so as to
allow it to serve its intended function. The applicant must demonstrate that a
technically suitable location is not reasonably available on an existing tower,
building or structure and include the reasons therefor. If another
communication tower is technically suitable, the applicant must show that it
has requested to collocate on the existing tower and the co-location request
was rejected by the owner of the tower along with the reasons for said
rejection. In all circumstances, owners of existing towers shall promptly
respond to requests for co-location, but in no event shall they respond in more
than thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of written request for
collocation. If another communication tower is technically suitable, the
applicant must further show that it has offered to allow the owner of the other
tower to co-locate an antenna on the applicant's tower on reciprocal terms and
that the offer was not accepted.
      (10)    Arbitration of co-location disputes. As an additional condition
of issuing the permit to construct and operate the tower in the City, the
owner/operator of the tower is required to sign a statement that all disputes
with other providers concerning co-location and the terms and conditions of co-
location shall be submitted to commercial arbitration under a system selected
by the parties but if the parties are unable to agree, then under the auspices
of the Commercial Arbitration Provision of the American Arbitration
Association.
      (11)    Discontinued use.  If at any time the use of the facility is
discontinued for one hundred eighty (180) days, a designated local official may
declare the facility abandoned.  The facility’s owner/operator will be
contacted and instructed to either reactivate the facility’s use within sixty
(60) days, or dismantle and remove the facility.  If reactivation or
dismantling does not occur within sixty (60) days, the permit shall
automatically expire on the two hundred and forty first (241) day.  In the
event that a facility is abandoned, the City reserves the right, after written
notice to the owner, to claim all right, title and interest in said facility
for what ever use it deems appropriate.
      (12)    Bond. The owner or operator shall be required, as a condition of
issuance of a zoning certificate, to post a cash or surety bond acceptable to
the Director of Law of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per
vertical foot from natural grade of the wireless telecommunication tower to the
highest point or antenna which bond shall insure that an abandoned, obsolete or
destroyed wireless communication antenna or tower shall be removed as provided
in subsection (a)(11) hereof.
      (13)    Annual inspection.  On each biennial anniversary date of the
issuance of the zoning certificate for a wireless telecommunication facility,
or not more than ninety (90) days prior thereto, the owner/operator user of
such facility shall cause an inspection to be completed of the facility by a
professional engineer registered in the State of Ohio, at the expense of the
owner/operator/user, and a certificate as to the structural integrity and
general safety of the entire wireless telecommunications facility and its
components shall be issued by such engineer to the City Building Commissioner. 
Upon receipt of said certificate, the Building Commissioner shall inspect, or
cause to have inspected, the facility for compliance with this chapter.
      (14)    Miscellaneous.
         A.    Advertising. No advertising is permitted anywhere on the
facility.
         B.    Lighting. The tower shall not be artificially lighted except to
assure safety or as required by the FAA.
         C.    Signage. Warning signs shall be posted around the facility with
an emergency telephone number of whom to contact in the event of an emergency.
      (15)    Approvals. An application must be considered and approved by the
Planning Commission and City Council with a subsequent Building Permit issued
by the Building Commissioner.
   (b)    Permitted Use In Designated Overlay Districts.  A wireless
telecommunications facility is permitted as of right in those areas within the
City zoned as a “T-1 Overlay District” which overlay districts have been
determined to be areas where the erection of a wireless telecommunication
facility will meet the spirit and intent of the chapter.

writing its reasons for denying the request, supported by substantial,
competent evidence, and such information as the applicant may reasonably
request to obtain consent.  The denial of consent shall not unreasonably
discriminate against the entity requesting the consent.
      (3)   Except in the case of a Public Utility subject to the jurisdiction
and recognized on the rolls of the public utilities commission or of a cable
operator possessing a valid franchise awarded pursuant to the "Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984," 98 Stat. 2779, 47 U.S.C.A. 541, the City,
for good cause shown, may withhold, deny, or delay its consent to any person
based upon the person's failure to possess the financial, technical, and
managerial resources necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
   (d)   Tolling of required timeframes.
      (1)   The time periods may be tolled only:
         A.   By mutual agreement between the entity requesting consent and the
City;
         B.   In cases where the City determines that the application is
incomplete; or
         C.   If the number of requests for consent for Small Cell Facilities
or Wireless Support Structures received is likely to result in difficulty
processing applications within the time limits set forth above due to the lack
of resources of the City, as determined by the Building Official, then the City
may toll the time limits for an additional period of time up to sixty (60)
days.
         D.   In no instance shall the City toll the time period for any Small
Cell Facility or Wireless Support Structure request by more than ninety
consecutive days. Upon request, the City shall provide an operator written
notice of the time limit for a Small Cell Facility or Wireless Support
Structure request.
      (2)   To toll the time period for incompleteness, the City shall provide
written notice to the person requesting consent no later than thirty (30) days
after receiving the request, clearly and specifically delineating all missing
documents or information. The missing documents or information shall be
reasonably related to determining whether the request meets the requirements of
applicable federal and state law. Any notice of incompleteness requiring other
information or documentation, including information of the type described in
section 4939.0313 of the Ohio Revised Code or documentation intended to
illustrate the need for the request or to justify the business decision for the
request, does not toll the time period.
      (3)   The time period for granting or denying consent resumes when the
entity makes a supplemental submission in response to the City's notice of
incompleteness.
      (4)   If a supplemental submission is inadequate, the City shall notify
the entity not later than fifteen (15) days after receiving the supplemental
submission that the supplemental submission did not provide the information
identified in the original notice delineating missing documents or information.
The time period may be tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices under
the procedures identified in divisions (1) to (3) of this section. Second or
subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or
information that was not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness.
   
   (e)   Timeframe for Completion of Permit.
      (1)   Permits granted for an Eligible Facilities Request, Collocation
with substantial modifications and new Wireless Support Structure shall be
completed by the operator or its agent within one hundred eighty (180) days
after issuance of the permit, unless:
         A.   The City and the operator agree to extend this period; or
         B.   A delay is caused by make-ready work for a City-owned Wireless
Support Structure or decorative pole or by the lack of commercial power or
backhaul availability at the site, provided that:
            i.   The operator has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services; and
            ii.   The additional time to complete installation does not exceed
three hundred sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit.
      (2)   If divisions (1)(A) and (B) of this section cannot be met, the
permit shall be void unless the City grants an extension in writing to the
operator.
   (f)   Consolidated application for multiple Small Cell Facilities and/or
Wireless Support Structures.
      (1)   Applicants seeking to construct, modify, collocate, or replace more
than one Small Cell Facility or more than one Wireless Support Structure may
file at the applicants discretion, a consolidated application for up to 15
Small Cell Facility requests or up to 15 Wireless Support Structure requests in
a single application and receive a single permit for the construction,
modification, Collocation, or replacement of the Small Cell Facilities or
Wireless Support Structures subject to the following:
         A.   This single application may be filed for multiple Small Cell
Facilities or multiple Wireless Support Structures only if they are of
substantially the same type.
         B.   The City may separately address Small Cell Facility Collocations
or Wireless Support Structures for which incomplete information has been
received or which are denied.
      (2)   In the case of a consolidated application, the fees provided for in
section 4939.0316 of the Ohio Revised Code may be cumulative. However, the
City, at its discretion may opt to reduce such fees in order to encourage
consolidated application submittals.
      (3)   In the case of a consolidated application, each Small Cell Facility
or Wireless Support Structure proposed to be constructed, modified, Collocated
on, or replaced shall constitute a separate request for consent for purposes of
tolling the response deadline as authorized under section 4939.036 of the Ohio
Revised Code. A request by a single operator for a new or replacement support
structure and associated Small Cell Facility constitutes one request.
   (g)   Small Cell and Wireless Support Structure Activities Not Requiring
Consent.
      (1)   City consent shall not be required for either of the following
activities conducted in the right-of- way:
         A.   Routine maintenance of wireless facilities;
         B.   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are consistent with the City's current design requirements and guidelines

for any activity described in division (1) of this section and for any activity
for which consent is authorized herein and under section 4939.031 of the Ohio
Revised Code. Any such permit shall be subject to any applicable State law.
      (3)   Notwithstanding the amendments made to sections 4939.01 to 4939.09
of the Ohio Revised Code by H.B. 478 of the 132nd General Assembly, a cable or
video service provider shall not be required to obtain permits from the City or
to pay fees, with the exception of work permits and associated fees, to place,
operate, maintain, or replace Micro Wireless Facilities pursuant to an existing
franchise or video service authorization under Chapter 1332 of the Ohio Revised
Code; nor shall a holder of an existing franchise or video service
authorization be required to obtain additional authorizations or to pay
additional fees for the placement of Micro Wireless Facilities already covered
under an existing franchise or video service authorization under Chapter 1332
of the Ohio Revised Code.  (Ord. 2018-115.  Passed 8-14-18.)

   (c)    To protect residences from vehicular traffic congestion in adjacent
business and other places of intense car concentration;
   (d)    To promote the prosperity of present and future business developments
which depend upon provisions for such conveniences; and
   (e)    To protect residents and pedestrians from the hazards created by use
of the streets for parking in areas where an excessive number of vehicles are
to be parked. (Ord. 1961-38. Passed 1-23-62.)

or
   (c)    Whenever the use of an existing building is changed to a use
requiring more off street parking spaces.
      (Ord. 1961-38. Passed 1-23-62.)
   1181.03 CONTINUATION OF PARKING FACILITIES.
   All existing off-street parking facilities or those required as accessory to

trailer is located within 500 feet of a residential property line. For purposes
of this section, "open storage or parking" means openly locating any commercial
vehicle or trailer in a commercial and/or retail accessory off-street parking

brightness. Flickering, moving or intermittent illumination shall not be
permitted. (Ord. 1961-38. Passed 1-23-62. )
   1181.15 OFF-STREET LOADING SPACE.
   Loading or unloading facilities shall be provided, in addition to off-street
parking, for all business, commercial or manufacturing buildings hereafter
erected or altered to such uses. Such facilities shall be not less than twelve
feet wide and located not less than fifty feet from the front property line
when facing the main street, and when alongside a building or alley, such
facilities shall be located so that a standing truck, loading or unloading, of
a size generally serving such purpose will not interfere with vehicular or
pedestrian traffic.
   At least one off-street loading space shall be provided for each 20,000
square feet of gross floor area, or fraction thereof, of manufacturing,
storage, wholesale or retail buildings and shall be maintained as long as such
building is occupied or unless an equivalent number of spaces is provided in
conformance with these requirements. (Ord. 1961-38. Passed 1-23-62.)
   1181.16 CONSTRUCTION LIMITED TO EXISTING USES.
   Reference in this chapter to uses which may now or hereafter be prohibited
within the Municipality is not to be construed as authorizing such uses but
rather is intended to establish off-street parking requirements for such uses
which may now exist.
(Ord. 1961-38. Passed 1-23-62.)
   1181.17 VARIANCES.
   The Planning Commission may, in specific cases, vary or permit exceptions to
the off-street parking and loading requirements set forth in this chapter if it
finds that such variance or exception will not violate the spirit or intent of

result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship as a result of some
peculiar or unique condition or circumstance pertaining to the construction,
reconstruction and/or modification of a structure. "Variance" also means a
modification of the strict enforcement of Chapters

   1349.01 TEMPORARY DRIVEWAY AND PROTECTIVE PLANKING.
   Before proceeding with the construction, enlargement, alteration, repair or
removal of any building or other structure, in the doing of which it is desired
or may be necessary to make use of, or to drive across the curb, tree lawn,
sidewalk, drainage ditch or culvert, the owner shall construct and maintain a
plank driveway, to the approval of the Inspector of Buildings, across and over
the curb, tree lawn, sidewalk, ditch or culvert, so that the same shall not be
injured or damaged, and shall install upon the property upon which a building
is being constructed, repaired, altered or moved, a temporary driveway of
gravel, slag or other materials sufficient to carry construction or material
vehicles and sufficient to prevent the accumulation of mud on the wheels of
such vehicles.  (Ord. 1820.  Passed 5-22-56.)
   1349.02 DEPOSIT REQUIRED; GENERAL REGULATION.
   Before such plank driveway is constructed and at the time of securing a
permit for the construction, enlargement, alteration, repair or removal of any
building or other structure, the owner or his agent shall deposit with the
Service Director a minimum amount of two hundred dollars ($200.00) for one-
family dwellings up to a maximum amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000) for
commercial or industrial buildings according to the extent of work necessary
and at the discretion of the Building Inspector, as a guarantee that the work
contemplated by the permit issued will be completed and that the plank driveway
will be constructed and maintained, and that if any curb, tree lawn, sidewalk,
ditch or culvert is disturbed or broken, the same will be replaced as above
provided at the cost and expense of the owner. Upon his failure to replace or
restore such curb, tree lawn, sidewalk, ditch or culvert so displaced or
broken, to the satisfaction of the Inspector of Buildings, the Inspector shall
have such work performed and shall pay the cost and expense thereof out of the
sum so deposited. In the event the sum as deposited is not sufficient to pay
such cost and expense, the owner shall be liable to the Municipality for any
balance. However, if the curb, tree lawn, sidewalk, ditch or culvert is left in
a condition acceptable to the Inspector, the sum so  deposited shall be
returned to the owner, and any part of the fund so deposited remaining after
the repairs, if any, are made, as herein provided, shall be returned to the
owner. However, five dollars ($5.00) of the deposit shall be retained by the
Municipality to cover the cost of inspection. If, after two years from the time
of making such deposit, the work contemplated by the permit issued has not been
completed and an occupancy permit therefor issued in accordance with Section
1305.07, or necessary repairs or restoration to the curb, tree lawn, sidewalk,
ditch or culvert have not been made, such deposit or any portion thereof
remaining shall be forfeited to the Municipality.  (Ord. 1972-54. Passed 6-13-
72.)
   1349.03 INSPECTION; REFUND.
   On the completion of the work for which such permit was issued and deposit
made, the applicant shall notify the Inspector of Buildings to make an
inspection for the purpose of determining what refund, if any, should be made
from the deposit. The Inspector shall require all earth, debris or building
material to be removed from the pavement, sidewalk or tree lawn, and the
Inspector may cause such earth, debris or material to be removed at the expense
of the applicant unless the applicant promptly performs such work. After
charges for all such work by the Municipality and the costs of inspection have
been deducted from the deposit, the balance shall be refunded to the owner.
(Ord. 1820. Passed 5-22-56.)
   1349.04 WORK WITHIN CITY RIGHTS OF WAY OR EASEMENTS.

work descriptions approved by the City Engineer/Public Service Coordinator
prior to the start of any work.  The City reserves the right to require any
work to be performed during non-peak or evening hours depending on the propose
work location.
   (c)   At such times as dictated by the City Engineer/Public Service
Coordinator, a City Inspector shall be required at all projects while working
within any City right-of-way.  The cost of the City Inspector shall be the sole
responsibility of the person who has been issued a permit.
   (d)   All trenches shall be compacted and disturbed areas shall be regraded
with a minimum four inches of topsoil spread and sodded.
   (e)   All persons shall replace, in kind, any existing structure damaged
through construction including trees and/or shrubbery and seeding.
   (f)   All persons shall be solely responsible to determine and locate all
existing underground utilities which may be affected during the construction.
   (g)   Any trenches under an existing pavement, sidewalk or driveway shall be
backfilled with premium backfill such as limestone, slag or crushed concrete
screenings, or flowable controlled density fill, or in any other reasonable
manner as determined by the City Engineer/Public Service Coordinator.
   (h)   Any pavement, including street aprons, drives, or walks, that is
removed shall be done on a joint to joint removal basis.
   (i)   At least one lane of traffic shall remain open at all times during
construction.
   (j)   Independence Police or approved flagmen shall be utilized to direct
traffic, as required.  All traffic control shall comply with the Ohio Manual of

   1354.06 RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACK REQUIREMENTS.
   It is hereby determined that the system of wetlands, riparian areas, rivers,
streams, and other natural watercourses within the City contributes to the
health, safety, and general welfare of the residents.  The specific purpose and
intent of these regulations is to:
   (a)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity of
flood waters, and regulating base flow;
   (b)   Assist in stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce bank erosion
and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse banks;
   (c)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in the
watercourse;
   (d)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling, and
transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses;
   (e)   Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food;
   (f)   Provide habitat to a wide array of aquatic organisms, wildlife, many
of which are on Ohio’s endangered and/or Threatened Species listing, by
maintaining diverse and connected riparian and wetland vegitation; and
   (g)   Benefit the City economically by minimizing encroachment on wetlands
and watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions such as
dams and retention basins to protect structures and reduce property damage and
threats to the safety of residents; and by contributing to the scenic beauty
and environment of the City, and thereby preserving the character of the City,
the quality of life of the residents of the City, and corresponding property
values.

repairs the Municipality may be held responsible, whether the damage shall be
inflicted by the person or his agents, employees or workmen; and further, that
the person shall hold the Municipality harmless against any liabilities,

or if the Inspector determines that such building is not structurally sound and
would present a hazard to public safety or public property during such moving,
such permission may be denied.  In any case of moving onto, across or through
any street, the Chief of Police shall first determine whether such moving shall
interfere with the use of the street by the public and shall require proper
protection of the public by inspectors, direction of traffic and warning
devices to be provided at the expense of the mover.

welfare and reasonable comfort of the residents and inhabitants of the City. It
is further found and declared that by reason of lack of maintenance and
progressive deterioration certain properties have the further effect of
creating blighting conditions and initiating slums, and that if the same are
not curtailed and removed, the aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and
will necessitate in time the expenditure of large amounts of public funds to
correct and eliminate the same. By reason of timely regulations and

prevented and the immediate neighborhood and property values thereby
maintained, the desirability and amenities of residential and nonresidential

adjoining premises as aforesaid. (Ord. 1970-44. Passed 6-23-70.)
   1365.12 FREEDOM FROM INFESTATION.
   All parts of the premises shall be maintained in order to prevent

(Ord. 1970-44. Passed 6-23-70. )
   1365.14 INSPECTIONS.
   (a)    Residential. All buildings and premises subject to this Code are
subject to inspections by the enforcing officer of the City. At the time of

accessible for such inspections, and the owner, operator and occupant are
required to provide the necessary arrangements to facilitate such inspections.
Such inspections shall be made between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. unless one of
the following conditions exists:
      (1)    The premises are not available during the foregoing hours for

At the time of such inspections, all exterior parts of the premises must be
available and accessible for such inspections, and the owner and operator art

Such inspections shall be made during regular open hours of the business
occupying the premises unless there is reason to believe a violation exists of
a character which is an immediate threat to health or safety requiring
inspection and abatement without delay.
   (c)   Report to Council. The enforcing officer shall report to Council after
each monthly inspection regarding the general maintenance of property within
the City, with a summary of code violations observed, the notices issued and

   1365.15 CONDUCT OF INSPECTORS.
   Inspectors shall conduct themselves in such a manner as to avoid intentional
embarrassment or inconvenience to occupants. (Ord. 1970-44. Passed 6-23-70.)
   1365.16 REFUSED ACCESS.
   (a)    Penalties. Where the Property Maintenance Officer or his agent is
refused access or is otherwise impeded or prevented by the owner, occupant or
operator from conducting an inspection of the premises, such person shall be in
violation of this Code and subject to the penalties hereunder.
   (b)    Search Warrant or Access Warrant. In addition to the provisions of
subsection (a) hereof, the Property Maintenance Officer may, upon affidavit,
apply to the Municipal Court of Garfield Heights for a search warrant setting
forth factually the actual conditions and circumstances that provide a
reasonable basis for believing that a nuisance or violation of this Code exists
on the premises. If the Court is satisfied as to the matter set forth in the
affidavit, the Court may authorize the issuance of a search warrant permitting
access to and inspection of that part of the premises on which the nuisance or
violation exists. Warrant for access may be issued by the Court upon affidavit
of the Property Maintenance Officer establishing grounds therefor pursuant to
Section
1365.21(d). (Ord. 1970-44. Passed 6-23-70.)
   1365.17 PROCEDURE FOR ABATEMENT; NOTICE; APPEAL.
   Where a violation of this Code or the regulations hereunder is found to
exist, a written notice from the Property Maintenance Officer shall be served
on the person responsible for the correction thereof.
   (a)    Contents of Notice. The notice shall specify the violation committed,
what must be done to correct same, a reasonable period of time not to exceed
forty-five days to correct or abate the violation and the right of the person
served to request a hearing. The notice shall become an order of the Property
Maintenance Officer in ten days after service unless a hearing is requested
pursuant to by section (c) hereof.
   (b)    Service of Notice. Notice may be served personally, by prepaid
telegram or by mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the last known address
of the person to be served. Where it is ascertained that the owner does not
reside on the premises, the "last known address" shall be the address of the
owner as shown in the office of the County Auditor. If the last known address
cannot be ascertained, the notice may be posted on the outside front entrance
of the building. The Property Maintenance Officer shall file and provide notice
to any owner or operator of any violation at any address other than the last
known address as provided hereunder if such other address is filed with the
Officer personally or by certified mail addressed to the Officer. The date of
service of the notice shall be determined where service is by mail as of the
day following the day of mailing for notices to addresses within the City, and
as of the fourth day after the day of mailing for notices to addresses outside
the City. Where the day of  service would fall upon a Sunday or other day when
mail is not ordinarily delivered,  then the day of service shall be the next
regular delivery day. Notwithstanding  any other provisions herein contained
where premises are subject to registration  pursuant to Section
1365.22 and have been so registered, notice served upon the  agent designated
therein shall constitute service upon the owner, operator and  lessor of the
premises, jointly and severally. Where the owner, operator or  lessor has
failed to register the premises as required under Section
1365.22,  or if the present premises have been registered, and if the agent
designated therein cannot be found at the address given in the registration,
the owner,  operator or lessor affected thereby may be served by posting notice
upon the  premises in a conspicuous place as near as possible to the front
entrance thereof.
   (c)    When Notice Becomes a Final Order. Within ten days of the date of
service of a  notice, the notice shall constitute a final order unless any
person affected by the  notice requests a hearing before the Board of Zoning
Appeals and serves a  written request within the ten-day period in person or by
mail on the Chairman  of such Board. Such request for a hearing before the
Board shall set forth briefly  the grounds or reasons on which the request for
a hearing is based and the factual  matters contained in the notice of
violation which are to be disputed at the hearing.  The Chairman of the Board,
upon receipt of the request, shall, within thirty  days therefrom and upon five
days' notice to the party aggrieved, set the matter  down for hearing.
   (d)    Determination at Hearing. At any hearing provided hereunder the
Chairman of  the Board shall be vested with all the powers provided by law to
compel the  attendance of witnesses and parties in interest by issuance and
service of subpoena, to require by subpoena the production of books, records or
other documents  at any such hearing which may be pertinent to matters to be
determined by him and  to enforce any such subpoena or secure any order for the
enforcement of any such subpoena as provided by law. Determination shall be
made within ten days from  the completion of the hearing. The Board shall issue
an order either incorporating  the determinations and directions contained in
the notice, modifying the same or  may withdraw the notice.
   (e)    Extension of Time. The Property Maintenance Officer may extend the
time for  correction or abatement of the violations for an additional period of
time not to  exceed thirty days, except where major capital improvements or
renovations are  involved, in which instance the time for completion may be
extended for a period  not to exceed ninety days beyond the expiration date of
the original notice.
   (f)    Noncompliance with Notice. Whenever the owner, agent, occupant or
operator of  a structure or premises fails, neglects or refuses to comply with
any notice of  the Property Maintenance Officer that becomes a final order as
provided in subsection (c) hereof, the Officer may advise the Law Director of
the circumstances  and request the Law Director to institute an appropriate
action at law to compel  compliance.
   (g)    Referral of Violations. Any violation of any ordinance other than
this Code discovered by the Property Maintenance Officer or his representative
shall be  reported to the official or agency responsible for the enforcement of
such  ordinance.
   (h)    Where Notice and Hearing Not Required Prior to Court Proceedings.
Notwithstanding the requirements of subsections (a) through (d) hereof,
violations of the following sections may be prosecuted without notice by the
filing of a complaint by the Property Maintenance Officer in the Municipal
Court: Sections
1365.16 ,
1365.21 (d) and
1365.22 .
   (i)    Effect of Notice on Owner. For the purposes of enforcement of this
Code, the service of a notice on an owner, whether or not the owner is also the
operator shall constitute notice of violations set forth therein until such
violations are abated in conformity with this Code and the other applicable
ordinances of the City. (Ord. 1970-44. Passed 6-23-70.)
   1365.18 EXISTING OFFENSES AND VIOLATIONS NOT DISCHARGED.
   The repeal of any provisions of any other ordinances by this Code shall not
affect any action for prosecution or abatement under any such ordinance or any
notice, complaint or order issued by any officer or agency of the City prior to
the effective date hereof or concerning any prosecution or other steps of
enforcement which have been taken or are being taken within any administrative
agency or in the Municipal Court for enforcement thereof. (Ord. 1970-44. Passed
6-23-70. )
   1365.19 POWERS AND DUTIES OF PROPERTY MAINTENANCE OFFICERS.
   (a)    Promulgation of Rules and Regulations. The Property Maintenance
Officer is hereby authorized and empowered to promulgate such written rules and
regulations as may be necessary for the proper interpretation and
administration of the provisions of this Code, provided that such rules and
regulations do not conflict with this Code and that they conform to the general
standards prescribed by this Code. The Officer shall file copies of such rules
and regulations with the Clerk of Council, the Municipal Engineer, the Fire
Chief, the Public Building Committee of Council, and the Board of Zoning
Appeals, and shall make available in the officer's office a copy for inspection
by members of the public during regular business hours. Such rules and
regulations shall have the approval of the Engineer and the Fire Chief
respectively where the provisions thereof relate to matters which are also in
the jurisdiction of any supervision of each officer. In case of conflict, the
rule or regulation may be promulgated by direction of the Public Building
Committee of Council. Such rules and regulations shall have the same force and
effect as the provisions of this Code, and the violations thereof shall be
enforced as violations of the express provisions of this Code as herein
provided.
   (b)    Power to Vary or Modify Provisions. The Property Maintenance Officer
shall have the power to withhold strict enforcement of the requirements of this
Code upon written application therefor by an owner, operator or occupant, after
making determination that:
      (1)    Any variation or modification of structure or use approved by the
Officer will not in any material way alter the standards of this Code and
cannot affect detrimentally the health or safety of occupants or the health,
safety or wet/fare of the occupants or owners-of adjacent premises or of the
immediate neighborhood; and
      (2)    Strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary
hardship on  the owner or operator because it would compel expenditures on the
premises  which would be substantially disproportionate to any benefit to
health,  safety or welfare that might be derived therefrom;
      (3)    The owner or operator is without any practical or feasible means
to comply  with the strict provisions of this Code;
      (4)    The strict enforcement of the provisions of this Code would
require the  installation of repairs and improvements estimated to exceed five
hundred  dollars ($500.00) in cost; and
      (5)    The premises subject to the Code are contemplated for acquisition
or are  within an area where acquisition is contemplated by a public agency
having  the power of eminent domain and there is a reasonable likelihood that
the  premises will be acquired and razed or moved within a period of two
years.  Any waiver of the provisions of this Code shall be canceled and the
Officer  shall strictly enforce the Code if it is ascertained subsequent to the
granting  of the waiver that the premises are in fact not to be acquired for
any public  use or purpose.
         A.    Right to hearing. Upon denial of any such application, the
owner, operator or applicant may request a hearing which shall be held in
accordance  with the provisions of Section
1365.17(c).
         B.    Application not to constitute a defense or stay. Such
application shall not  constitute a defense of any violation of this Code
concerning any proceedings which are pending in the Municipal Court when the
application  is filed nor shall any variance or modification allowed hereunder
constitute a vested right against any ordinance enacted hereinafter by  Council
compelling strict enforcement of any provisions of this Code.
          C.    Record of variations or modifications granted. Where variations
or modifications are approved by any section of this Code, by the Property 
Maintenance Officer, by action of the Board of Zoning Appeals or by any court,
a written record thereof stating the name of the applicant, the address of the
premises, the variation or modification approved, the date of approval and the
reasons therefor, satisfying the provisions  contained herein, shall be
prepared by the Officer and filed both under  the section or sections of this
Code to which the variation or modification  applies and under the address of
the premises. Such files shall be  available for public inspection in the
office of the Officer during regular  business hours.
   (c)    Annual Review. The Property Maintenance Officer shall in the month of
May of each year review with the Fire Chief, the Municipal Engineer and the Law
Director the procedure and operation of this Code, and report to Council, on or
before September 15:
      (1)    Any recommended amendment, addition or modification or provisions
of this Code consonant with the field experience of the personnel charged with
enforcement;
      (2)    A summary of the enforcement experience indicating number of
violations abated, number of cases processed in the Municipal Court, number of
inspections made and such other and further pertinent information as will
provide Council with an annual account of progress in securing the standards 
required by this Code; and
      (3)    Any further recommendation as to how the Code and the procedure
and  operations thereunder can be improved.
         (Ord. 1970-44. Passed 6-23-70.)
   1365.20 INSPECTION AND STATUS REPORTS.
   (a)    Application for Inspection. Whenever an owner, operator, occupant,
bona fide prospective purchaser, mortgagee or bona fide prospective occupant
shall apply to the Property Maintenance Officer for an inspection in order to
ascertain if any section of this Code has been violated, the Officer shall,
upon payment of the fee hereunder stated, cause an inspection to be made of the
premises and issue an informational certificate or report of the inspection to
the applicant, indicating therein any violations of this Code on the premises.

of the fee prescribed herein and the written request, a copy of any notice or
order on any violation then pending shall be sent to the applicant.
   (c)    Significance and Scope of Inspection or Status Report. No inspection
report issued under subsection (a) hereof or status report under subsection (b)
hereof shall be construed as providing a defense against any violation of this
Code or any other ordinance of the City which may be discovered thereafter
whether or not the condition or violation existed at the time of any such
inspection or status report. The inspection or status report is provided as a
convenience to the public and shall not constitute a limitation on the full
enforcement of this Code. The inspection or status report shall include only
such matters as are embraced in this Code.
   (d)    Inspection and Status Report Fees.
      (1)    The minimum fee for any inspection made under subsection (a)

adjoining properties.
   (c)    Issuance of Certificate; Conditions. If the Board of Zoning Appeals
determines that access is deemed absolutely necessary to accomplish or complete
repairs or improvements necessary for compliance with this Code, then the Board
shall issue a certificate of necessity setting forth therein the person to whom
the certificate shall apply, such conditions as shall be necessary to protect
the adjoining property, reasonable time limits during which such certificate
shall operate, precautions to be taken to avoid damages and where the Board
deems proper, a bond to be procured at the expense of any persons seeking
access to secure the adjoining property against damage to persons or property
arising out of such rights of access. The bond shall not exceed in amount ten
thousand dollars ($10,000), unless conditions deemed advisable by the Board
appear otherwise, and the amount set shall take into consideration the extent,

interfere with a neighboring property owner’s right to enjoy his property.  To
this end and to minimize light trespass:
   (a)   All sources of illumination of the exterior of buildings or grounds
shall be shielded so as not to cause direct glare and shall be directed away
from any lot lines and toward the principal building and parking area on a
lot.  Lighting fixtures and devices from which direct glare is visible on
adjoining roads or property shall be prohibited.
   (b)   All sources of illumination of the exterior of buildings or grounds
shall be shielded so as not to cause glare which is hazardous to vehicle
drivers or is objectionable to owners of adjacent lots.
   (c)   Lighting fixtures with lamps rated at initial lumens of two thousand
five hundred (2,500) or greater must be the full cutoff type.  For purposes of
this chapter, a full cutoff light fixture is defined as one which emits no
light above a horizontal plane drawn through the lowest part of the fixture.
   (d)   Light fixtures used to illuminate flags, statutes or any other objects
mounted on a pole, pedestal, or platform shall use a narrow cone beam of
light.  Only one fixture with a lamp emitting no more than 1,800 lumens shall
be used for each flag, statute, or other object illuminated.
   (e)   Flashing lights shall be prohibited.
   (f)   When used for security purposes or to illuminate walkways, driveways
and storage areas, roadways, equipment yards and parking lots, only fully
shielded cut-off style light fixtures shall be utilized.
   (g)   All outdoor light pole fixtures shall not exceed a maximum height of
thirty-five (35) feet.  (Ord. 2009-42.  Passed 11-10-09.)
   1376.02 EXEMPTIONS.
   The following shall be exempted from Section
1376.01:
   (a)   All outdoor lighting fixtures producing light directly by the
combustion of fossil fuels, such as kerosene lanterns or gas lamps, are exempt
from the requirements of this section.
   (b)   All low-voltage lighting rated twelve (12) volts or less and seasonal/
holiday lighting shall be exempt from this section.

   1377.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   This Chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the City as identified below, including any additional areas of
special flood hazard annexed by the City:
   (a)   For the purposes of this Chapter, the following studies and/or maps
are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas and Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
both effective December 3, 2010;
(Ord. 2010-42.  Passed 11-9-10.)
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard
include:
         A.   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City as required by Section
1377.04(c), Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this Chapter.  Such maps and/or studies
are on file at the City's Building Department located at 6335 Selig Drive,
Independence, Ohio  44131.
   (b)   This Chapter is not intended to repeal any existing ordinances or
resolutions including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes.  In
the event of a conflict between this Chapter and any other ordinance or
resolution, the more restrictive shall be followed.  This Chapter shall not
impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the land subject to such
interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (c)   In the interpretation and application of this Chapter, all provisions
shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of this Chapter may be in conflict with a
state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over this
Chapter.
   (d)   The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations.  Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.  Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This Chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder; and
   (e)   Should any section or provision of this Chapter be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
      (Ord. 2007-31.  Passed 12-11-07.)
   1377.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this Chapter the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory Structure” means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of this Chapter or a request for a variance.
   (c)   “Base Flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the 1% chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL).  In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from 1 to 3 feet).
   (e)   “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor.”  See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)” means the Executive
Order issued by President Carter in 1977, which requires that no federally
assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified
special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood or Flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)” usually means the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for the City depicting approximate special flood
hazard areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones” means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of the
City.  Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are determined.
Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average
depths are determined.
Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood
depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are
determined.
Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be
protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-
year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing
drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation” (FPE) means the Flood Protection
Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation plus [0] feet of freeboard.  In
areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the
flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge.  A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height.  In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the City.  The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following:  Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management.  Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC)” is an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.  LOMC’s are broken down into
the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area.  A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area;
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. 
One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area; and
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria.  A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure.  This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in this Chapter for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."  For the
purposes of this Chapter, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park” means, as specified in the Ohio
Administrative Code 3701-27-01, any tract of land upon which three or more
manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or
for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle,
or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park.  A
tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or
rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)” is the Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding.  This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. 
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a City will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the City as a financial protection against
flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction” means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City
Flood Insurance Rate Map, February 18, 1981, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   “Person” means any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies.  An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised
Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but
is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau,
society, council, institution, state college or university, community college
district, technical college district, or state community college.  “Agency”
does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant
general’s department, or any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis,
      (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)    Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered Professional Architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   “Registered Professional Engineer” means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   “Registered Professional Surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   “Special Flood Hazard Area,” also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard,” is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year.  Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99.  Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date.  The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation.  Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.  For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building;
   (hh)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial Damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial Improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement.  This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. 
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered “new
construction”;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
   (kk)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of this Chapter
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with this Chapter.
      (Ord. 2007-31.  Passed 12-11-07.)

of the Clean Water Act.
      (2)   Approval.
         A.   Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a complete
application, the Floodplain Administrator shall either approve or disapprove
the application.  If an application is approved, a floodplain development
permit shall be issued.  All floodplain development permits shall be
conditional upon the commencement of work within one (1) year.  A floodplain
development permit shall expire one (1) year after issuance unless the
permitted activity has been substantially begun and is thereafter pursued to
completion.
   (f)   Inspections.  The Floodplain Administrator shall make periodic
inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order
to monitor compliance with permit conditions.
   (g)   Post-Construction Certifications Required.  The following as-built
certifications are required after a floodplain development permit has been
issued.
      (1)   For new or substantially improved residential structures, or
nonresidential structures that have been elevated, the applicant shall have a
Federal Emergency Management Agency Elevation Certificate completed by a
registered surveyor to record as-built elevation data.  For elevated structures

certificate may be completed by the property owner or owner’s representative.
      (2)   For all development activities subject to the standards of Section
1377.03(j)(1), a Letter of Map Revision.
   (h)   Revoking a Floodplain Development Permit.  A floodplain development
permit shall be revocable, if among other things, the actual development
activity does not conform to the terms of the application and permit granted
thereon.  In the event of the revocation of a permit, an appeal may be taken to
the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with Section
 1377.05 of this Chapter.
   (i)   Exemption from Filing a Development Permit.  An application for a
floodplain development permit shall not be required for:
      (1)   Maintenance work such as roofing, painting, and basement sealing,
or for small nonstructural development activities (except for filling and
grading) valued at less than $5,000;
      (2)   Development activities in an existing or proposed manufactured home
park that are under the authority of the Ohio Department of Health and subject
to the flood damage reduction provisions of the Ohio Administrative Code
Section 3701;
      (3)   Major utility facilities permitted by the Ohio Power Siting Board
under Section 4906 of the Ohio Revised Code;
      (4)   Hazardous waste disposal facilities permitted by the Hazardous
Waste Siting Board under Section 3734 of the Ohio Revised Code; and
      (5)   Development activities undertaken by a federal agency and which are
subject to Federal Executive Order 11988 – Floodplain Management.
   Any proposed action exempt from filing for a floodplain development permit
is also exempt from the standards of this Chapter.
   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City flood maps, studies and other data identified in Section
1377.01(a) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the City shall ensure that technical data reflecting
such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available.  These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
 1377.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
 1377.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA.  Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1377.03(j)(1)(A).
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details.  Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation / detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
have been modified by annexation or the City has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the City Flood Insurance Rate
Map accurately represent the City boundaries, include within such notification
a copy of a map of the City suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the City has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source;
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations.  Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator;
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
this Chapter; and
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA.  Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard.  A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1377.05 Appeals and Variances; and
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire,
etc.  After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair
process.  These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in this Chapter, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   Development in floodway areas shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.  Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation.
         B.   Any development in floodway areas causing increases in the base
flood elevation may only be permitted provided all of the following are
completed by the applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1377.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the City, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City and the Chief Executive
Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one (1) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met.
         B.   Any development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified
by FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one (1) foot increase in the base flood elevation
may only be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible; and
            2.   Section
1377.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. to 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse.  For the purpose of this Chapter, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.  The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites:  An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique
or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished.  Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished;
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency;
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.  The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with The
City specifying the maintenance responsibilities.  If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit; and
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1377.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 2007-31.  Passed 12-11-07.)
   1377.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Establishment of Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Independence Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby appointed to
serve as the Appeals Board for this chapter as specified by Chapter
1125 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Independence.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall:
         A.   Hear and decide appeals from any order, requirement, decision or
determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or
enforcement of this Chapter; and
         B.   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1377.05(d) of this Chapter.
      (2)   Records of the Board of Zoning Appeals relating to this Chapter
shall be kept and filed in the City’s Building Department located at 6335 Selig
Drive, Independence, Ohio  44131.
   (c)   Appeals.   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Board of Zoning Appeals provided
that such person shall file, within 10 days of the date of such notice and
order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator’s decision.  Such appeal shall be in writing, signed
by the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator.  Upon receipt
of the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made
to the Board of Zoning Appeals.    
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall fix
a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in
interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted;
   (c)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of this Chapter would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power
to authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of this
Chapter, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to
the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Board of Zoning Appeals.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant, legal
description of the property, parcel map, description of the existing use,
description of the proposed use, location of the floodplain, description of the
variance sought, and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Public hearing.
         A.   At such hearing, the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Board of Zoning Appeals requires.  In considering such variance
applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, relevant factors, and standards specified in this
Chapter.  In addition, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall also consider and make
finding of facts on the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the City;
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property.  Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of this
Chapter does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant;
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this Chapter;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws;
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages; and
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of this Chapter, the
Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances
as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Chapter.
      (3)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1377.05(d)(2)(A)(i) to (xi) have been fully considered.  As the lot size
increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.   
   (e)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of
Zoning Appeals may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common
Pleas, as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

sediment settling volume and the maximum expected disturbed area that will be
directed to the sediment pond during construction. The plan should include a
summary of the following:
               i.    The required sediment storage and dewatering volumes
               ii.    The provided sediment storage and dewatering volumes
               iii.    The weir length or skimmer size, as applicable
               iv.    The weir length or skimmer size provided
            viii.    The location of permanent SCMs to be used to control
pollutants in stormwater after construction operations have been completed.
            ix.    Areas designated for the storage or disposal of solid,
sanitary and toxic wastes, including dumpster areas, areas designated for
cement truck washout, and vehicle fueling.
            x.    Methods to minimize the exposure of building materials,
building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt.
            xi.    Measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and
leaks. Applicants may also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill
Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs,
Safety Response Plans, etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement
and a copy of such plan is maintained on site.
            xii.    Methods to minimize the discharge of pollutants from
equipment and vehicle washing, wheel wash water, and other wash waters. No
detergents may be used to wash vehicles.
Wash waters shall be treated in a sediment basin or alternative control that
provides equivalent treatment prior to discharge.
            xiii.    The location of designated stoned construction entrances
where the vehicles will ingress and egress the construction site.
            xiv.    The location of any in-stream activities including stream
crossings.
      (4)    A soils engineering report. The City of Independence engineer may
require the SWP3 to include a Soils Engineering Report based upon his/her
determination that the conditions of the soils are unknown or unclear to the
extent that additional information is required to protect against erosion or
other hazards. This report shall be based on adequate and necessary test
borings, and shall contain all the information listed below. Recommendations
included in the report and approved by the City of Independence engineer shall
be incorporated in the grading plans and/or other specifications for site
development.
         A.    Data regarding the nature, distribution, strength, and
erodibility of existing soils.
         B.    If applicable, data regarding the nature, distribution,
strength, and erodibility of the soil to be placed on the site.
         C.    Conclusions and recommendations for grading procedures.
         D.    Conclusions and recommended designs for interim soil
stabilization devices and measures, and for permanent soil stabilization after
construction is completed.
         E.    Design criteria for corrective measures when necessary.
         F.    Opinions and recommendations covering the stability of the site.
            (Ord. 2017-20.  Passed 10-10-17.)
1380.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization).
   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment
pollution  controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction. Perimeter controls must be installed two working
days prior to commencement of construction. The approved plan must be
implemented until the site reaches final stabilization. All properties adjacent
to the site of soil disturbing activity shall be protected from soil erosion
and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands.
   It is the owner’s responsibility to maintain current records of contractor
(s) responsible for implementation the SWP3 and providing that information to
the City of Independence engineer or administrator of code. The SWP3 shall
identify all subcontractors engaged in activities that could impact stormwater
runoff. The SWP3 shall contain signatures from all of the identified
subcontractors indicating that they have been informed and understand their
roles and responsibilities in complying with the SWP3.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities. The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)    NON-STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION MEASURES: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, and designation of tree preservation
areas or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall
be minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a 50-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the state, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible (e.g., stream
crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation
and restoration). Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment
removal and maximize stormwater infiltration.
   (b)    EROSION CONTROL PRACTICES: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. The amount of soil
exposed during construction activity shall be minimized. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
      Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)    Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed.
 
      (2)    Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall 
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Ohio Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide
available at www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)    RUNOFF CONTROL PRACTICES. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion. Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion.
Such practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to
direct flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These
practices shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive
flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)    SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICES. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site. Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. Such practices
may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain
inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to
a sediment settling pond. The design, installation and maintenance of erosion
and sediment controls shall address factors such as the amount, frequency,
intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater
runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes
expected to be present on the site.
   (e)    All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are
not considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment settling pond.
      Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)    Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)    Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the City of Independence Engineer
and/or the Cuyahoga SWCD, is required for any one of the following conditions:
         A.    Concentrated stormwater runoff.
         B.    Runoff from drainage areas which exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3) inlet protection, or other sediment barriers;
         C.    Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land.
Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a sediment trap or
sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Ohio Rainwater and Land
Development. The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a sediment
trap shall be limited to less than 5 acres. Contributing drainage areas of 5
acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin. An equivalent best
management practice may be utilized upon approval from the City of
Independence.
The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 1,800
cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum 48-
hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always withdraw runoff
from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle. As such, a skimmer
discharge device consistent with Ohio Rainwater and Land Development shall be
provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide both a
sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure shall be
constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest edition
of Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.
When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used as
temporary sediment trapping SCMs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
Ohio Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase
and until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the City of
Independence.
The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of sediment
basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the pond
provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering zone. As
such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be no
discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage zone
and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only occur
through the skimmer.
The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods:
Method 1: The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1,000 ft3 per
disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
Method 2: The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume necessary
to store the sediment as calculated with RUSLE or other generally accepted
erosion prediction model.
When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not co- mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone
must be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the
inlets and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at least two
units of length for each one unit of width . 2:1 length-to-width ratio;
however, a length to width ratio of . 4:1 is recommended. Sediment must be
removed from the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity of the
sediment storage zone has been completely filled by sediment accumulations.
This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin
depth. When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider
public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for 
the sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment
and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is
encouraged.
      (3)    Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties
and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow. Where intended to
provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and
shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The relationship between the
maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in
Table 3 below. Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the size
of the permissible drainage area.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  < 2%
0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                > 20% but < 50%
 
      (4)    Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the City of Independence, but their use shall not exceed the
limitations indicated in Table 3 above. Detail drawings and plan notes shall
specify the diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative
perimeter controls if used instead of silt fence.
      (5)   Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to 10 acres.
      (6)    Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond. Straw or hay
bales and filter socks around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet
protection.
      (7)    Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. SCMs must be
implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and that dust is
controlled. These SCMs must include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.    Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the
only permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These
entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than 2” in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.    Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances
shall be kept free of sediment tracked off site. Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall
be cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
Based on site conditions, the City of Independence engineer and/or the Cuyahoga
SWCD may require additional SCMs to control off site tracking and dust. These
additional SCMs may include:
         C.    Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
         D.    Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas. Wash water from
these areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-
settling pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1380.09 (g) of this regulation. No surfactants or detergents may be used to
wash vehicles.
         E.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The City of Independence engineer and/or
the Cuyahoga SWCD may require dust controls including the use of water trucks
to wet disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of
disturbed areas, and regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (8)    Surface Waters of the State protection. Construction vehicles
shall avoid water resources. A 50 foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be
provided around surface waters of the state unless infeasible. If it is
infeasible to provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the
SWP3 shall comply with the stabilization requirements in
1380.09(b)(1) for areas within 50 feet of a surface water or riparian or
wetland setbacks if applicable, whichever is greater; and minimize soil
compaction and, unless infeasible, preserve topsoil. If a riparian or wetland
setback is greater than 50 feet, no disturbance of natural vegetation shall
occur within the riparian or wetland setback unless a variance to the riparian
or wetland setback regulation has been granted. If the applicant is permitted
to disturb areas within 50 feet of a water resource, the following conditions
shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.    All SCMs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.    Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.    No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in water resources
or wetlands.
         D.    Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.    Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.    Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control
structures shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or
close to the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough,
slip, or erode.
         G.    Concentrated stormwater runoff from SCMs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands. The flow should
be released such that no erosion occurs downslope. Level spreaders may need to
be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities
      (9)    Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (f)    NON-SEDIMENT POLLUTANT CONTROLS: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in stormwater runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources, wetlands or
the MS4. These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      A.    Waste Materials: A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      B.    Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or water of the
state is prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available.
      C.    Disposal of Other Wastewaters: The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the state is prohibited. The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
      D.    Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest
containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up
spills. The SWP3 shall contain spill prevention and response procedures and
these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction meeting.
      E.    Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly. The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      F.    Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
Where construction activities are to occur on sites with contamination from
previous activities, operators shall be aware that concentrations of materials
that meet other criteria (i.e. not considered a Hazardous Waste, meeting
Voluntary Action Program (VAP standards)) may still result in stormwater
discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality Standards. Such discharges are not
authorized by this code. Control measures which may be utilized to meet this
requirement include, but are not limited to:
         i.    Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated
runoff and prevent discharge.
         ii.    Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer with
the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
         iii.    Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or other
such methods to prevent storm water from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building materials,
building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Applicants may
also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, Safety Response Plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site.
   (g)    COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (h)    TRENCH AND GROUND WATER CONTROL. There shall be no sediment- laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (i)    INTERNAL INSPECTIONS. All controls on the site shall be inspected a
at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm
event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection
frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is
temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g.,
site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of
inspection requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions
are expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been
attained from the City of Independence Engineer and/or the Cuyahoga SWCD and
all of the following conditions are met:
      A.    The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
      B.    Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
      C.    The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls. These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)    Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (2)    Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the City of Independence or an alternate
form acceptable to the City of Independence engineer. The inspection form shall
include:
         A.    The inspection date.
         B.    Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
         C.    Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
         D.    Weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of inspection.
         E.   Locations of:
            1.    Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
            2.    SCMs that need to be maintained.
            3.    SCMs that failed to operate as designed or proved  inadequate
for a particular location.
            4.    Where additional SCMs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
         F.    Corrective action required including any necessary changes to
the SWP3 and implementation dates.
      (3)    Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
      (4)    Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of offsite vehicle tracking.
      (5)    The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
   (i)    MAINTENANCE. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. All
sediment control practices must be maintained in a functional condition until
all up slope areas they control reach final stabilization. The applicant shall
provide a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the continued
performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party and
adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the City of
Independence engineer.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control SCMs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)    When SCMs require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection  reveals that a SCM is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)    When SCMs fail to provide their intended function. If an internal
inspection reveals that a SCM fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within ten (10) days.
      (3)    When practices SCMs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice SCM has not been
implemented in accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be
implemented within ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the
internal inspection reveals that the planned control practice is not needed,
the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the control

1381.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General: The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site.
Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and comply with Chapter 1380.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land-use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Ohio Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the City and Ohio EPA.
SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional criteria
required by the City Engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use: SCMs shall be designed to achieve
the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with
the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter
1107.20, shall provide stormwater management and water quality controls for the
development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot
grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-
hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development runoff
patterns, volumes, and peak flows from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources: SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the owner shows
proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S.
Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as required
in Section
1381.14 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1380 Erosion and Sediment Control, all as determined by the City Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels: All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the owner shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
 1381.08 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCM, or if the
stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by practices
defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the City
Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance: All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the City Engineer as
detailed in Section
1381.08.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the City, SCMs serving
multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and maintained by
an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property owners, by the
City. SCMs serving single lots shall be placed on these lots, protected within
an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage. SCMs that preserve and/
or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum extent
practicable. Such SCMs may include minimizing site grading and compaction;
protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and existing
vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction operations in
order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time, and designation
of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and grubbing practices;
and maintaining un-concentrated stormwater runoff to and through these areas.
Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide perpetual management of
runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving stream’s physical, chemical and
biological characteristics are protected and ecological functions are
maintained.
      (10)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology: Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters a wetland(s) in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydro period,
and wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. SCMs such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration basins,
conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent streams,
depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the wetland
hydrology. If the owner proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a
hydrological analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed
discharge matches the pre-development hydro periods and hydrodynamics.
      (11)   Soil Preservation and Post-Construction Soil Restoration: To the
maximum extent practicable leave native soil undisturbed and protect from
compaction during construction. Except for areas that will be covered by
impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil moisture-
holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded must be restored to
that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent practicable. Areas
that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer removed should be
amended using the following steps: 1. till subsoil to a depth of 15-18 inches,
2. incorporate compost through top 12 inches, 3. Replace with stockpiled site
or imported suitable topsoil to a minimum depth of 4 inches.
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection: The City Engineer may allow modification
to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only if the owner
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
1381.16 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1380 Erosion and Sediment Control, all as determined by the City Engineer. At a
minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize
changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat
of upstream and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges: Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the owner development site shall be conveyed through
the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at its
existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that off-site
runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a manner
that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow: The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the City Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the City Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with landscaped
banks and designed to carry the 10-year, 24-hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open Drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm Sewer
systems shall be allowed to augment open drainage systems, such as to limit
depth of roadside or conveyance ditches. The following criteria shall be used
to design storm sewer systems when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5 - year, 24 - hour storm, and that the hydraulic
grade line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10 - year, 24 - hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these
requirements when conveying the flows from the contributing area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
         C.   All stormwater conveyance systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the City:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25-year, 24-hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all exceptional warmwater
habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat streams, and Class III headwater streams.
The footers or piers for these bridges and open spans shall not be constructed
below the ordinary high water mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25%) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box
culverts and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must to be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10-
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be one foot below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the
100-year, 24-hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as determined by FEMA,
whichever is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City must be
compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume of material. First
consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be
given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new
floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also
be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for
floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing
watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the City, reductions in volume due to
floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the
development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must
reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The
use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control:
      (1)   Direct runoff to a SCM: The site shall be designed to direct runoff
to one or more of the following SCMs. These SCMs are listed in Table 2 of this
regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general performance
standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The City Engineer may require a soil engineering report to be
prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed infiltration facilities
meet these performance standards.
For sites less than five (5) acres, but required to create a comprehensive
stormwater management plan, the City Engineer may approve other SCMs if the
applicant demonstrates to the City Engineer’s satisfaction that these SCMs meet
the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
1381.09.
         C.   For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the City Engineer may approve other SCM’s if
the owner demonstrates to the City Engineer’s satisfaction that these SCM’s
meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
1381.09, and has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         D.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the City Engineer may approve SCM’s not included in Table 2 of this
regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the Ohio
Departments of Transportations “Location and Design Manual, Volume Two Drainage
Design”.
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs. SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the City Engineer
that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs controlling the
amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-term hourly
records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
                  WQv = C*P*A/12
               where terms have the following meanings:
                  WQv = water quality volume in acre-feet
                  C =    runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1
in.
                  P =    0.75 inch precipitation depth
                  A =    area draining into the SCM, in acres.
Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA) for use in determining the water quality volume can be determined using
the list in Table 1 or using the following equation to calculate the runoff
coefficient:
                  C=0.858i3 – 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:
                  i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land-use
 
Land-use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land-use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
 
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the SCM for sediment storage. This volume shall be
incorporated into the sections of SCMs where pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   Each individual SCM must be sized to treat the WQv associated
with its entire contributing drainage area. Exceptions to this may be granted
by the City Engineer and/or the OEPA on a case-by-case basis.
         D.   SCMs for quality shall be designed such that the drain time is
long enough to provide treatment and protect against downstream bank erosion,
but short enough to provide storage available for successive rainfall events as
defined in Table 2.
         E.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
Table 2: Draw Down Times for Stormwater Control Measures
 
Stormwater Control Measure                        Drain Time of WQv
Infiltration Basin or Trench1                     48 hours
Permeable Pavement – Infiltration1              48 hours
Permeable Pavement – Extended Detention         24 hours
Extended Detention Facilities                      
    Dry Extended Detention Basin2               48 hours
    Wet Extended Detention Basin 3              24 hours
    Constructed Wetlands (above permanent pool) 24 hours
    Bioretention Area/Cell5,6                   24 hours
    Sand and other Media Filtration5            24 hours
1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended detention
basins. Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv.
3 Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQV .
4 Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water. Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Ohio Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale. 7Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to
the WQv, with 25% of the WQv in a pool and 75% in marshes. The EDv above the
permanent pool must be equal to the WQv.
 
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.    Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
in the current edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.    All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.    During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.    The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time. If
elevations allow, a valve shall be provided to drain any permanent pool volume
for removal of accumulated sediments. The outlet shall be designed to minimize
clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and promote the capture of floatable
pollutants.
         B.    The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation.
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the vegetation.
The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). The aquatic
bench shall be planted with hardy native species of plant comparable to wetland
vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged inundation. The use of invasive
plant species is prohibited.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The forebay and micro pool volume shall
be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
            4.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance.
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
      (5)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs:
The owner may request approval from the City Engineer for the use of
alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the owner shows to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer that these SCMs are equivalent in pollutant
removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those listed in Table
2. If the site is greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5) acres but
part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five (5)
or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA and the city as necessary. To
demonstrate the equivalency, the owner must show:
         A.    The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80%, using the Level II Technology Acceptance Reciprocity
Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.    The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the owner can demonstrate one
of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100% of the
project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5% of the watershed upstream of the
development site, unless a TMDL has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the City Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet)
of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development drainage
area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the following
standards:
            1.    Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.    Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.    Model pervious, directly connected impervious and
disconnected impervious areas as separate subwatersheds.
            4.    Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            5.    Rainfall Depth –For the most accurate, up-to-date, location-
specific rainfall data for stormwater design, use the Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States, NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). [available online: http://
hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.]
            6.    Temporal Distribution Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events. Include lot coverage assumptions used for
full build out of the proposed condition.
            7.    Curve numbers for the pre-development condition must reflect
the average type of land-use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land-use. Curve Numbers shall conform to the National Engineering Handbook
Table 9-1.
               i.    Pre-development Curve Numbers – For wooded or brushy
areas, use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, 1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values.
For all other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture,
grassland, or range in good hydrologic condition.
               ii.    Post-development Curve Numbers - Open space areas shall
use post- construction HSGs from Rainwater and Land Development unlessthe soil
is amended after development according to the following protocol: till the
subsoil to 15-18 inches, then till using a chisel, spader, or rotary tillage
and incorporate compost through top 12 inches, replace topsoil to a minimum
depth of 4 inches. All undisturbed areas or open space with amended soils shall
be treated as “open space in good condition.”
            8.    Time of Concentration. Use velocity based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
            9.    The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume. Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in Ohio Rainwater and Land Development or a hydrologic
model acceptable to the City Engineer.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems. From
the volume determined in Section 1337.09(D)(3)(a), determine the percent
increase in volume of runoff due to development. Using the percentage, select
the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table 3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
 
If the percentage of Increase in Volume
of Runoff is:                            The Critical Storm
Equal to or Greater Than: And Less Than: will be:

---                       10             1 year
10                        20             2 year
20                        50             5 year
50                        100            10 year
100                       250            25 year
250                       500            50 year
500                       ---            100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
   (e)   Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects:
      (1)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment
projects shall reduce existing site impervious areas by at least 20 percent. A
one-for-one credit towards the 20 percent net reduction of impervious area can
be obtained through the use of green roofs. Where site conditions prevent the
reduction of impervious area, SCMs shall be implemented to treat at least 20
percent of the WQv.
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and stormwater
quality control facilities are used, ensure a 20 percent net reduction of the
site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv,
or a combination of the two.
      (3)   Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume required to be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at 20 percent.
      (4)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives may be
approved by the City Engineer.
         (Ord. 2017-19.  Passed 10-10-17.)
1381.10  EASEMENTS.
   Future access to all permanent vegetative and/or mechanical post-
construction Water Quality Conservation Practices (SCMs) and other areas, as
required by the City, shall be secured by means of perpetual easements.
   (a)    The easements shall be recorded in the name of the City and of the
Maintenance Organization. Recorded easements must provide for City access.
   (b)    Such easements shall be not less than twenty-five (25) feet in width,
in addition to the width of the ditch, channel, or other facility it is to
serve. Further, an easement of this type shall be provided on one (1) side of
the flood control or storm drainage ditch, channel, or similar-type facility.

movement of inspectors and maintenance equipment and also restricted against
the changing of final grade from that described by the grading plan.
      (Ord. 2017-19.  Passed 10-10-17.)
1381.11  MAINTENANCE.
   Any portion of the permanent post-construction water quality management

constructed by the owner, will be continuously maintained into perpetuity.
   (a)    Detailed drawings and maintenance plans must be provided for all
post-construction SCMs.
   (b)    Maintenance plans must ensure that pollutants collected within
structural post- construction SCMs are disposed of in accordance with local,
state, and federal guidelines.
   (c)    Maintenance plans shall be provided by the permittee to both the City
Engineer and the post-construction operator of the SCM (including Maintenance
Organizations) upon completion of construction activities and prior to the City
Engineer giving final approval for the completed construction.
   (d)    Single-Family Residential Developments: A Homeowners’ Association
shall be created and placed in title of the affected lands and shall be
continuously responsible for post-construction maintenance and inspections into
perpetuity unless such maintenance and inspections become officially accepted
by the City.
   (e)    Multi-Family, Commercial, and Industrial Developments: The plans will
clearly state that the Maintenance Organization of the property shall be
continuously responsible for post-construction maintenance and inspections into
perpetuity unless such maintenance and inspections become officially accepted
by the City.
   (f)    Maintenance Design: Low maintenance requirements are a priority in
the design and construction of all facilities. Multi-use facilities
incorporating assets such as aesthetics and recreation may be incorporated into
the design of the drainage facilities. All permanent drainage, soil erosion,
sediment control, water quality management systems, and SCMs, including on-site
and off-site structures and vegetation that are constructed or planted, must be
inspected and maintained into perpetuity by the responsible party designated in
the plans and the requirements of this chapter. Inspections and maintenance
will be incorporated periodically throughout the year to ensure that the
facilities are properly operational.
   (g)    Perpetual Maintenance Inspections: One (1) inspection with a written
report will be performed each year. The written report will be given to the
City Engineer by May 1st of each and every year after the SCM has been
completed.
      (1)    Structures that require a permit from the Ohio Division of Water:
A written and stamped report from a professional engineer on the status of all
structural SCMs that require a permit from the ODNR Division of Water. This
applies to all SCMs that require a permit either at the time of construction or
fall under the jurisdiction of ODNR Division of Water at any time after
construction is completed.
      (2)    Easements: A written report from an inspector on the status of all
stormwater management easements for each project shall be submitted to the City
Engineer by May 1st of each year into perpetuity. These reports will document
if restricted plantings, fences, and structures are on the easement and will
identify the location of the noted easement restriction violations.
      (3)    SCMs that do not have a high risk for loss of life, bodily injury,
or damage to structures or infrastructure related to imminent failure as
determined by the City Engineer: A written and stamped report from a
professional engineer, landscape architect, or CPESC on the status of permanent
soil erosion, sediment control, water quality management systems, and the
status of the related easements shall be submitted to the City Engineer by May
1st of each year into perpetuity.
      (4)    SCMs that have a potential loss of Life: A written and stamped
report covering the status of all SCMs that have a potential for loss of life,
bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure will be prepared by a
professional engineer or other individual possessing a valid state license that
authorizes them to design the same type of SCM for construction.
         (Ord. 2017-19.  Passed 10-10-17.)
1381.12  MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control pollution of water resources, the owner or person
responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards.
   (a)    Standards and Specifications: post-construction runoff practices used
to satisfy these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the
current edition of the Ohio Rain Water and Land Development Manual, NRCS Field
Office Technical Guide for the local county, or the Ohio EPA, which ever is
most stringent. The construction of new roads and roadway improvement projects
by public entities shall implement post-construction SCMs in compliance with
the current version of the Ohio Department of Transportation’s location and
design manual, volume two: drainage design that has been accepted by Ohio EPA.
   (b)    Water Quality Basins:
      (1)    Pool geometry: The minimum length-to-width ratio for the pond is
3:1.
      (2)    Riser in embankment: The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
      (3)    Water drains: Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that can
completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the pond to
prevent sediment deposits from plugging the drain.
      (4)    Adjustable gate valves: Both the water quality and the stormwater
management basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall be
located inside of the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be
operated in a safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the
valves shall be fully opened and closed at least once and the certifying

ordinance, the most restrictive provisions, as determined by the City, shall
prevail.
   (b)   If any clause, section, or provision of this regulation is declared
invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
of the remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)   This regulation shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a nuisance on their property and compliance with the provisions of
this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate such a nuisance.
   (d)   Failure of the City to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly
conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the site owner
from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom, and
shall not result in the City, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting therefrom.
(Ord. 2007-54.  Passed 12-11-07.)
   1382.06 RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION.

   1382.07 DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illicit Discharges.  No person shall discharge, or
cause to be discharged, an illicit discharge into the MS4.  The commencement,
conduct, or continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is prohibited
except as described below:
      (1)   Water line flushing:  landscape irrigation, diverted stream flows,
rising ground waters, uncontaminated ground water infiltration, uncontaminated
pumped ground water, discharges from potable water sources, foundation drains,
air conditioning condensate, irrigation water, springs, water from crawl space
pumps, footing drains, lawn watering, individual residential car washing, flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands, dechlorinated swimming pool discharges,
street wash water, and discharges or flows from fire fighting activities. 
These discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the City
to be significant contributors of pollutants to the MS4;
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the City as being necessary to
protect public health and safety; and
      (3)   Discharges from off-lot discharging home sewage treatment systems
permitted by the Cuyahoga County Board of Health for the purpose of discharging
treated sewage effluence in accordance with Ohio Administrative Code 3701-29-02
(6) until such time as the Ohio EPA issues an NPDES permitting mechanism for
residential 1, 2, or 3 family dwellings.  These discharges are exempt unless
such discharges are deemed to be creating a public health nuisance by the
Cuyahoga County Board of Health.
In compliance with the City Storm Water Management Program, discharges from all
off-lot discharging home sewage treatment systems must either be eliminated or
have coverage under an appropriate NPDES permit issued and be approved by the
Ohio EPA.  When such permit coverage is available, discharges from off-lot
discharging home sewage treatment systems will no longer be exempt from the
requirements of this regulation.
   (b)   Prohibition of Illegal Connections.  The construction, use,
maintenance, or continued existence of illegal connections to the MS4 is
prohibited.
      (1)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (2)   A person is considered to be in violation of this regulation if the
person connects a line conveying illicit discharges to the MS4 or allows such a
connection to continue.
         (Ord. 2007-54.  Passed 12-11-07.)

subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit discharge inspection is
a violation of this regulation.
      (7)   If the City is refused access to any part of the facility from
which storm water is discharged and the City demonstrates probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this regulation or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of an inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this regulation or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, the City may
seek issuance of a search warrant, civil remedies including but not limited to
injunctive relief, and/or criminal remedies from any court of appropriate
jurisdiction.
      (8)   Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility owner/operator.
         (Ord. 2013-13.  Passed 4-9-13.)

abatement.
   (b)   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the Notice of Violation shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed.  The Notice of Violation shall
further advise that, should the facility owner/operator fail to remediate or
restore within the established deadline, a legal action for enforcement may be
initiated.  All costs of remediation shall be at the facility’s owner’s sole
expense.
   (c)   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation must meet compliance
standards within the time established in the Notice of Violation, unless an
undue hardship is presented to the City Engineer, and the Engineer grants
additional time for abatement.
   (d)   Administrative Hearing:  If the violation has not been corrected
pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Notice of Violation, the City
shall schedule an administrative hearing, to be conducted by the City Planning

property damage, risk to human life and safety hazard that could potentially be
caused by increased hillside instability.
   (b)   To maintain the City's natural and existing waterways, creeks and
streams, and the stability of their riparian areas, in order to provide the
safe and natural flow of normal and storm water run-off with minimal erosion
and sedimentation.
   (c)   To assure access to properties within the Protected Hillside Zone
areas by emergency police and fire vehicles to protect persons and property.
   (d)   To permit, subject to the best available technology, development on
Protected Hillside Zone areas while conserving and promoting the public health,
safety, convenience and general welfare by minimizing problems due to water
runoff and soil erosion problems incurred in adjustment of the topography to
meet developmental needs.
   (e)   To use the best accepted design, landscape architecture, architecture,
civil engineering and hydrological engineering to preserve, enhance and promote
the existing and future appearance and resources in Protected Hillside Zone
areas.
   (f)   To preserve and enhance the natural beauty of property adjacent to
Protected Hillside Zone areas by maximizing retention of natural topographical
features such as natural drainage swales, streams, slope ridge lines, rock
outcropping, vistas from and of hillside, trees and other natural plant
formations and retain the sense of identity and image that the Protected
Hillside Zone areas now impart to the City.

   1531.01 INSTALLATION REQUIRED.
   In addition to all other requirements of the Building Code, it shall be the
responsibility of the owner of each existing hotel and motel, as defined in
Section
1107.08(g) of these Codified Ordinances, to install approved automatic fire
detection and alarm devices, as provided in Section
1531.02, on or before August 12, 1981, unless such hotel or motel already has
an automatic fire detection and alarm system which was installed pursuant to
the provisions of Chapter
1341 of these Codified Ordinances, unless any other provision of law requires
installation before that date, or unless the Fire Chief, upon application of
the owner, grants an extension beyond such date for good cause shown. (Ord.
1995-45. Passed 12-12-95.)
   1531.02 INSTALLATION SPECIFICATIONS.
   (a)   Location. At least one approved automatic fire detection and alarm
device shall be installed in each guest room of all hotels and motels. Each
hallway in all hotels and motels shall have at least one approved automatic
fire detection and alarm device located every thirty feet along the hallway and
at the head of each set of stairs leading to a floor containing guest rooms.
   (b)   Standards. All automatic fire detection and alarm devices shall be
installed in accordance with the standards set forth in Sections 4101:2-89-04
and 4101:2-89-05 of the Ohio Basic Building Code, in such a manner as to assure
that rising smoke is not obstructed from reaching the detector. Hallway and
stairwell detectors shall be installed so as to assure that the detector
intercepts rising smoke before it reaches a guest room, and detectors within
guest rooms shall be installed so as to assure that rising smoke is detected
before it reaches the sleeping area. All hallway and stairwell detectors shall
be wired directly to the building's main enunciator panel. It is preferred that
all guest room detectors also be wired to the building main power supply.
However, such guest room detectors may be powered by a self-monitored battery
or operated in a plug-in outlet which is fitted with a plug restrainer device,
provided the outlet is not controlled by any switch other than the building's
main power supply.
   (c)   Approval. As used in this chapter, "approved automatic fire detection
and alarm device" or "approved detector" means a device or system providing an
emergency function without the necessity of human intervention, capable of
sensing heat, smoke or other visible or invisible products of combustion, and
providing a suitable alarm thereof activated as a result of a predetermined
temperature rise, rate of rise of temperature, or increase in the level of
combustion products. All such approved detectors shall be installed in
conformity with the Building Code and this chapter and shall be approved by the
Fire Chief or Municipal Fire Safety Inspector and listed as approved by the
Fire Chief or Municipal Fire Safety Inspector for the purpose for which they
are intended. Such list of approved detectors may be subsequently amended by
the Fire Chief or Municipal Fire Safety Inspector as necessary, but approval of
any particular detector shall be permanent unless the Fire Chief or Municipal
Fire Safety Inspector subsequently finds that the equipment is hazardous or
unreliable, in which case the Fire Chief or Municipal Fire Safety Inspector may
suspend or revoke approval and determine whether replacement of such existing
equipment shall be required.
   (d)   Alternative Installation. As an alternative to self-contained
automatic fire detection and alarm devices, an approved fire detection system
may be installed. Each such fire detection system must be individually approved
and a permit issued therefor by the Fire Chief. (Ord. 1995-45. Passed 12-12-
95.)
   1531.03 MAINTENANCE.
   All automatic fire detection and alarm devices shall be maintained in proper
working order at all times and shall be subjected to periodic tests which the
Fire Chief determines to be necessary to ensure the proper working order of
such automatic fire detection and alarm devices. Such tests shall be conducted
by the owner or his or her authorized representative at least once a year in
the presence of the Fire Chief or his or her designee.
(Ord. 1995-45. Passed 12-12-95.)
   1531.04 INTERPRETATION; CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   The requirements of this chapter shall be in addition to all other
requirements of these Codified Ordinances except as set forth in Chapter
1531.01. Should there be any conflict between the requirements of this chapter
and any other provision of these Codified Ordinances, the requirements of this
chapter shall govern. (Ord. 1995-45. Passed 12-12-95.)

Municipal Fire Safety Inspector. The Fire Chief or Municipal Fire Safety
Inspector or his or her designee shall be authorized to inspect any hotel or

of such hotel or motel, which notice shall inform the owner that such owner has
thirty days to correct such violation. No owner or person in charge of a hotel
or motel shall refuse to allow inspection of the premises by the Fire Chief or
Municipal Fire Safety Inspector or his or her designee for purposes of ensuring
the proper installation and continued maintenance of the automatic fire
detection and alarm devices.
   (b)   Whenever any person fails, neglects or refuses to comply with an order
of the Fire Chief or Municipal Fire Safety Inspector under the provisions of
this chapter, or whenever any existing hotel or motel is used or occupied so as
to be in violation of or not in conformity with any provision of this chapter,
the Fire Chief or Municipal Fire Safety Inspector may, at his or her
discretion, institute and maintain in the name of the Municipality an
appropriate action at law or in equity to restrain the execution in violation
of this chapter, to prevent the occupation or use of such existing hotel or
motel and to prevent or terminate any violation of this chapter. (Ord. 1995-45.
